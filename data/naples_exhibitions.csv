During a previous stay of hers, Jana Schröder was amazed at how gadgets, T-shirts, flags and scale reproductions of Maradona in the colors of the Neapolitan team invaded every street. The blue and white colors create a recurring landscape with cheerful and fun, almost familiar tones. Therefore, although the artist has no particular football interests, he decided to undertake a production whose colors recalled the connection with Maradona's Napoli.""El Pibe de Oro"" represents for Neapolitans the revenge of an area that until the 1980s had always remained on the margins. The popular identification in that young Argentine boy, raised in the most deprived suburbs of Buenos Aires, who led the team and the city to indelible victories ensured that the memory did not fade over time and that his figure became a myth.Thus the large abstract white and blue paintings in the gallery rooms symbolize Maradona challenging the colors of other teams. Ideal teams that are pitted against each other in the gallery rooms with canvases of different colors ranging from acerbic green tones to orange to bright pink. The arrangement of the works does not follow the typical pattern; rather, the works stand in the space like soccer players on the field. In addition to the eleven canvases, there are eleven works on paper in the main room that reproduce an ideal formation made up of goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards, lined up as in a soccer scheme.Each work follows declinations of shades of the same color combined with white. What varies is the texture of the gesture and its impression on the canvas. The artist also plays with lines and shapes, seemingly random, which instead subtend a pattern consisting of lines of different thickness, now sinuous now geometric that chase each other across the canvas. In pursuit of the rapid drying times of acrylic, the multidirectional movements of the fast brushstrokes become symbols of the purest pictorial gesture. Like a dense net that, however, does not trap the viewer, but acts as a bank accompanying his gaze.Jana Schröder was born in 1983 in Brilon, DE.She lives and works in Düsseldorf, DE.Schröder’s artistic practice is based on the action of painting itself. The formalist education in the class of Albert Oehlen at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf deeply influenced her in producing paintings characterized by sinuous brushstrokes that guide the viewer in the discovery of a complex composition through many layers of color. Schröder’s practice is a meditation on process and repetition, slowness and speed, the process becomes part of the work. Lines, grids or rhythmised webs suggest the elusive movement of her hand. Her research reveals that every painting, every paperwork strikes out with its own experience and composes itself as an individual sign. Schröder operates with the aesthetic matter of everyday scribbling holding something the application of colour longs for: spontaneous, casual, and self-evident originality. The deliberation of such moments is a relief of gestures which in its nebulous density of information prevents any reconstruction of the painterly act, is contrasted by parts of more frenzied, quickly-applied paint which register the trace of the artist’s decisive hand at work.",Jana Schröder: D.

"Thomas Dane Gallery, Naples",Naples,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/akram-zaatari-father-and-son/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Akram Zaatari,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/akram-zaatari/,"Akram Zaatari (b. 1966, Saida) has played a critical role in developing the formal, intellectual and institutional infrastructure of Beirut's contemporary art scene. He has produced more than fifty films and videos, a dozen books and countless installations of photographic material, all sharing an interest in writing histories and the search for records and objects, keeping track of their changing hands, the retrieval of narratives and missing links that have been hidden, misplaced, lost, found, buried or excavated. The act of digging itself has become emblematic of his practice while acting to restore connections lost over time, or due to war and displacement. Zaatari has dedicated a large volume of his work to the research and study of photographic practices in the Arab world and has made uncompromising contributions to the wider discourse on preservation and archival practice.Rooted in this research practice, Zaatari’s exhibition in Naples retraces the element of restitution in the artist’s work, expressed mainly through text, documents and photographs that revisit descriptions and recreate objects or ties that once existed but are now lost. The exhibition features works across many media from the last two decades, beginning with his two-hour-long video, Ain el Mir (2002), in which the artist looks for a buried letter that never reached its destination. It spans through to Zaatari’s most recent body of work, Father and Son (2024), in which the sarcophagi of two Phoenician Kings (father and son), separated since antiquity, are reunited. The project is accompanied by a series of new works on paper that look at the Mediterranean as a locus of exchange, extraction and movement across millennia.Amongst these works Archeology (2017), Photographic Currency (2019) and Venus of Beirut, (2022), and a new work, Ibrahim and the Cat, For Inji Efflatoun (2024), all engage in the process of recreating objects that have either vanished or were never produced. The brass relief Ibrahim and the Cat – made with artisans in Naples – gives new form to a forgotten photograph taken by the father of Egyptian artist Inji Efflatoun for the purpose of making a painting that was never produced.Zaatari's idea of ‘giving life to things that do not exist in the present’ also applies to the recreation of a stone monolith used to seal King Tabnit’s tomb, which was completely destroyed when his sarcophagus was extracted in 1887. All that Refuses to Vanish (2022) was made from drawings and notes left by Ottoman statesman and painter Osman Hamdi during his excavation of the Sidon Necropolis.Akram Zaatari lives and works in Beirut, Lebanon.
