The pieces invite viewers to engage with themes of migration and cultural hybridity, emerging as an artistic odyssey into the aesthetics of contemporary urban life. The dynamic interplay of diverse cultures within these spaces are seen through anatomies that could be plucked from the Los Angeles environment or from the depths of an artist’s laboratory.Although differing significantly from his recent collections Archaeology of Consciousness and Éternel, Crossing Over continues the artist’s signature expression of recycled surfaces. The recovery of materials is a fundamental part of the development of Crossing Over and becomes its primary creative act. Hand-painted recycled fibreglass, semi-precious stones and metals combine in a new assembly of processes and contribute to a new organicity, as seen in De Cotiis’s distinct and monumental cabinets. The DC2117 Cabinet (2012), for example, is constructed of hand-painted fiberglass and German silver, the black façade presented as a shard of ancient material on a modern scale. These pieces are geometric and avant-garde, poetically brutalist and functionally simple – a meeting point that embraces the clash between urbanisation and the natural world.In other works, De Cotiis’ Neo-Primitive low tables are rooted to the ground like sturdy thrones; notable works include the DC2203B Side Table (2020), made from Malachite Challant marble, with opposing textures of hand-painted fiberglass, and the DC2211 Side Table (2022), which features contrasting materials and patterns cascading like the depths of the ocean. The DC1924 Floor Lamp (2019) consists of angular neon lights encapsulated in antiquated glass tubes and set in a polished and cast brass frame, a material that’s come a signature of the artist. Each piece demonstrates De Cotiis’ introspection into linguistics, perception and materiality.Crossing Over resembles the work of an anthropologist who, through the study of cultures and traces, combines the differences and similarities within a given period.  De Cotiis thinks of pure time as perpetual, absent from our world that’s saturated with images, simulacra, and reconstructed realities. Crossing Over becomes a nuanced tapestry, weaving together the intricate threads of temporal diversity and the timeless purity of existence.De Cotiis comments: “Crossing Over is a journey, an exploration in search of places that I have seen and spaces that exist in my imagination. I have pursued cultures in search of symbols and iconographies that overlap with mine. It is research on contamination. All that is layered inside me, which belongs to me, but above all, what I still haven’t yet encountered.”",Vincenzo De Cotiis: Crossing Over,"7070 Santa Monica Boulevard, CA 90038","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 28 Feb  - 19 Jun 2024

While driving around Los Angeles in 1998, Rhoades explains the relationship of cars to his art (parking is equated with sitting in a sculpture) and to daily practice (driving between the house, the studio and stores is time and space for the mind to race and wander). He expounds on cars as icons of art history (Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia speeded modern art forward with their mechanized abstractions), identifiers of class (you are what you drive) and environments of control. The radio is tuned to Power 106 FM and as the world streams by to the propulsive hip-hop beat, the romance of cars seems irresistible.In April, the installation will be reconfigured to accommodate a lounge and become The Pit. An influx of archival materials will be key to unpacking the various episodes of Rhoades’ Car Projects, starting with the Caprice and the 1996 exhibition ‘Traffic.’ Not only did the artist cut a deal with CAPC musée d’art contemporain de Bordeaux, France the organizers of the show, to go in on buying him the car as a transactional work of art, he later leveraged its symbolic value by trading the Caprice for a Ferrari.This summer the exhibition’s focus will swerve onto The Racetrack. A set of half-scale NASCAR-style cars, custom jackets and colorfully painted tire barriers are among what remains of ‘The Snowball.’ Staged in California as a daylong racing event at Willow Springs speedway, ‘The Snowball’ was ultimately destined for the 2000 Venice Biennale and Rhoades’ collaborative work for the Danish Pavilion. In September, The Garage will cover the final stretch of ‘DRIVE’ with a selection of framed works on paper and a major sculptural installation.Throughout the year, the line-up for ‘DRIVE’ will feature a range of public programs. A film series centered on cars and the city of Los Angeles will be curated by film historian and critic Elvis Mitchell. A theatrical staging of the playwright Charles Mee’s ‘Under Construction,’ which was inspired by Rhoades’ art in its collage depiction of America today, will be presented as part of Hauser & Wirth’s Performance Project.Organized as an investigation in real time, ‘DRIVE’ invites people to approach the exhibition like a garage of art and ideas, in which cars are coming and going and tinkering is a productive state of mind. As an artist, Rhoades was keenly attuned to sources of cultural power and weakness. When he put the internal combustion engine on art’s pedestal, was he presciently placing the car where it belongs for a greener tomorrow? The car as a subject in Rhoades’ art continues to drive and trouble the imagination today.",Jason Rhoades. DRIVE,"901 East 3rd Street, CA 90013",Tue-Sun 11am-6pm, 27 Feb 2024 - 14 Jan 2025

The artist’s unique approach allows for an active exchange with the medium, inviting chance and unpredictability into his practice. In surreal and fragmentary scenes, Otero mines his personal history to make sense of the current moment, animating everyday objects and environments that are loosely based on the domestic spaces of his youth.While Otero is best known as a painter, his exhibition at Hauser & Wirth marks the artist’s return to sculpture. Combining ceramics with welded metal, three new sculptural works on view evoke the mutable landscapes of childhood remembered. Their subject matter consists of identifiable objects that undergo transformation and reconstruction, creating uncanny new contexts. Otero’s playful reimagining of these artifacts and their associations is not dissimilar to the ways in which memory becomes distorted over time.",Angel Otero.

LA Louver,Los Angeles,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/rebecca-campbell-young-americans/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Rebecca Campbell,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/rebecca-campbell/,"The largest painting in the exhibition, Greenhouse (2023) (96 x 144 inches) offers an introduction to this new body of work. Set within a scene of Campbell’s current home, the artist’s three children are situated throughout the house, experiencing the world from different perspectives. However personal, this is not a world removed from our own; the viewer is painted from the balcony and thus called into subjecthood. Cryptic translations of the surrounding landscape into thickly troweled slabs of abstracted paint signal an irrepressible inner world made visible, engaging viscerally and intellectually with the legacies of expressionism, and feminist critique.Symbolism is deftly wielded by Campbell throughout the exhibition, demonstrated by the two portraits Where Have You Been My Blue-Eyed Son? (2023) and In Utero (2023), which voice the polarities of teenage volatility. One depicts a rain-laden poppy, strong and vibrant despite its delicacy. The other is an archetypal image of a teenager, cross-legged in a Nirvana band tee with a face both hopeful and challenging. Each an image of the beguiling energy and tenuous balance of this vulnerable period of life, Campbell expresses tension and growth through the scale of the central figures in relation to their square frames.Los Angeles parallels teenagerhood throughout the exhibition as a place of precarity, excesses, opportunity, fear, and multiple realities. Depicting a scene outside of the city, Hollywood is a Sign (2023) holds an amalgam of illusions and truths stereotypical of L.A. The cerulean pool – an unnatural feature in the desert – offers a rich metaphor for the beauty, spiritualism, and artificiality echoed throughout the painting. In Between (2024) evokes a similar pull between fantasy and reality as two girls, each clothed in a sumptuous red gown (the artist’s own wedding dress), convey curiosity and anxiety in a secluded world overlooking the distant skyline of downtown Los Angeles.The image of an ecstatic and impasto-ed lemon tree in California Love (2023) is another elucidation of the paradoxical nature of L.A. Surrounded by a garden of other flourishing non-native plants, it is an image from the artist’s backyard from a time during the pandemic when the skies were vibrantly hued by the wildfires in Southern California – a beautiful and aberrant sight. The esoteric figures of Wolf Moon (2024) and Wolf Moon II (2024) present an otherworldly experience of a different kind as cryptograms akin to tarot cards. Emblematic of Campbell’s persistent theoretical inquiry into the perceiver / perceived dynamic, the figures are occluded and protected by veil or shadow.“To watch someone is to hold them apart, to see them is to remember them, a piece of yourself.” The eponymous Young Americans paintings engage with and build upon previous series of portraits that Campbell has created throughout her career. The subject of this collection is her children and their friends, the representatives of our future in closely observed vignettes, navigating adolescence in a world of extraordinary uncertainties. Already changed from the time of these portraits, these young Americans each encapsulate the nostalgia, inspiration, unfolding and anticipation of this body of work. Campbell accomplishes a transcendent task in these paintings, demonstrating not only masterful technical prowess but also the ability to convey universal ideas through individual experience.Rebecca Campbell was born in Salt Lake City, Utah and now lives and works in Los Angeles. L.A. Louver has represented the artist since her graduation with an MFA from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2001, presenting six solo exhibitions and featuring her work in over a dozen group exhibitions. Campbell’s work has been seen at Art Basel Switzerland, Art Basel Miami Beach, ARCO Madrid, and ADAA: The Art Show New York and is represented in both private and public collections across North America and Europe including Brigham Young University, Provo, UT; California State University Long Beach, Long Beach, CA; Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR; Laguna Art Museum, Laguna Beach, CA; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, CA; Nora Eccles Museum of Art, Utah State University, Logan, UT; Phoenix Art Museum, Phoenix, AZ; and the Utah Museum of Fine Arts, Salt Lake City, UT. Campbell has combined her studio practice with a rich teaching career at institutions including California State University, Fullerton, and Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, CA. ",Rebecca Campbell: Young Americans,"45 North Venice Boulevard, CA 90291","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 10am-2pm", 29 May  - 20 Jul 2024

Lisson Gallery Los Angeles,Los Angeles,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/bernard-piffaretti-je-nai-jamais-peint-un-tableau-recent/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lisson-LA.jpg,Bernard Piffaretti,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/bernard-piffaretti/,"In accordance with this process, each canvas is first of all bisected by a single vertical line. The artist then paints a spontaneous composition on one side of that dividing boundary, and then repeats it on the other. The deliberate ensuing ambiguity as to which side was painted first questions notions of originality, the authentic gesture, and completion.Upon entering the gallery, visitors are met with Piffaretti’s abstractions in close dialogue with one another. The artist views his oeuvre as a constantly refined singular work, carefully curating exhibitions to feature compositions from various years, often with a decade or more between them.In this instance, the exhibition is comprised of paintings made over a span of thirty years, and traces back to some of the earliest pieces made using Piffaretti’s signature motif. The oldest work on view, Untitled (1987), was created just one year after the artist began consistently basing his practice around “the central mark”.In addition to the division of his canvases, there are other facets that can also be traced through Piffaretti’s practice. For example, Untitled (1990) features a sequence of crossed red lines forming a lattice structure and Untitled (2008) presents a series of multicolored bulbous shapes, both recurring elements within his larger body of work. These details are present in other paintings such as Untitled (2005) and Untitled (1994) respectively.Piffaretti's commitment to looking back, whether immediately with his mirrored canvases or historically through references, is central to his method. In the same vein, the exhibition’s title, an adoption of a 1969 quote by Man Ray directly translating to “I have never painted a recent painting,” is a nod to Piffaretti’s belief that no work is ever truly new. To him, nothing is without precedent. As well as referencing his own previous pieces, the artist has cited influence from an array of painters, ranging from the likes of Marcel Duchamp and Henri Matisse to Barnett Newman and Andy Warhol. The works resulting from Piffaretti’s “system” act as a physical representation of the artist’s inclination to question the traditions and institution of painting.",Bernard Piffaretti: Je n’ai jamais peint un tableau récent,"1037 N.

As Jackson Pollock remarked of his friend and fellow Abstract Expressionist: when Kanemitsu was painting, it was as if he was nature itself. Expressing the complex human experience of natural forces in sumi ink, watercolor, and acrylic, these works embody both the splendor and the perils of a sunset in a scorching desert, the churning waves of a Pacific storm, or rivers of rain in a summer deluge. Even as he battled cancer, which would take his life at the age of 69, Kanemitsu embarked on a final series of paintings featuring fields of radiant, scintillating dots. Paired with energetic dashes and waves of molten color, they illuminate the canvas like the prickle of warm sunlight on skin.Born in Utah and raised in Hiroshima, Kanemitsu enlisted in the United States Army in 1941 and had his first exhibition in an army detention camp, where he was held after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. After living in Europe, then in New York, where he studied at the Art Students League and became an active member of New York’s Abstract Expressionist school, Kanemitsu was brought to Los Angeles in 1961 to work at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop. Kanemitsu became a revered art educator in LA, teaching at Chouinard Art Institute and Otis Art Institute over the next several decades.The exhibitions and community gatherings that Kanemitsu staged at 800 Traction Avenue were vital to the flourishing of the Arts District, promoting artistic exchange within the LA arts scene and supporting the work of young local artists, particularly those in the Japanese American community. The fight for recognition of Kanemitsu’s historical importance to the development of the Arts District is ongoing, supported by forthcoming scholarly research and oral history projects.Works by Matsumi Kanemitsu are held in numerous public collections worldwide, including the Art Institute of Chicago; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco; Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY; Museum of Modern Art, NY; Whitney Museum of American Art, NY; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo.Louis Stern Fine Arts is the exclusive representative of the estate of Matsumi Kanemitsu.",Matsumi Kanemitsu: Traction Avenue,"9002 Melrose Avenue, CA 90069","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 18 May  - 29 Jun 2024

Her healing journey has resulted in a prolific series of works that have evolved into a playful yet formidable anthology of Latinx and Mexican-American experiences in Southern California. Diaz's surreal paintings chronicle a collective unconscious of cultural iconography, pop references, current events, and familial dynamics and traditions that shape the worldview of the artist and her communities. In Diaz's latest series, she expands her visual storytelling to encompass music and performance through the Northern Mexican genre of narrative ballads, the corrido.KARLA DIAZ: Mujer Valiente y Los Diablitos (The Brave Woman and The Little Devils) invites you to the artist's fantasy world of her alter ego, Mujer Valiente, the lead singer of the band, Los Diablitos, and their tour through various beloved locations in East LA, from Mariachi Plaza to Whittier Boulevard. The exhibition elaborates on the storytelling of the corrido, where the artist has flipped its traditional tropes to empower women. Historically, corridos have been used as a forum for oral histories and storytelling, facilitating social messages crooned by heroic men, where, in contrast, women are often nonexistent or mentioned in allegories warning against social deviance. Diaz's reinterpretation not only flips the gender roles but also brings new content to a genre that, in its contemporary moment, has had controversy and even legal ramifications for songs promoting illegal activities, narcotics, misogyny, violence against women, and femicide. Her artistic agency is a powerful testament to the strength and resilience of women, inspiring us all to challenge societal norms and reclaim our narratives.Through the lyrics—sung, performed, and vibrantly painted on canvas—we learn the story of the brave woman who does not even fear the devil (“no le teme ni al diablo”), and her determination and resilience in overcoming a broken heart. The storytelling in corridos, like many ballads, is abstracted and blends fact and probability with fiction and drama for effect. Diaz adapts this in full force—painting lyrics saturated in her distinctive palette of rainbow hues, dreamy washes, and colors that conjure the magic of cultural vernacular, from cheerfully painted neighborhood shops to bougainvillea pinks, cactus greens, colorful textiles, and concert costumes. In these works, the artist often assumes fantasy characters, taking up roles of power and positions that have typically been dominated by men, such as a corrido singer, a bullfighter, or a boxer. Amidst the paintings, the exhibition's installation also features a music video and a large painted backdrop that immerses viewers inside her imaginary concert hall.The narratives tell the story of the Latina artist who dreams of being a star and what it would be like to occupy positions of power that women often have little or no access to. Adapting the corrido genre to playfully carry mythical characters and woman-centered novellas of love, abandonment, and heartache with urgent and pressing social themes of protest, immigration, and political unrest. Diaz's works embrace, amplify, and provide an array of emotional releases through humor, earnestness, and nostalgia. Mujer Valiente reconstitutes the corrido as a space for radical discourse. The exhibition and corrido not only tell the story of an individual woman's strength but also celebrate her neighbors and friends who support and cheer for her—essentially, a love song for Diaz's community.Karla Diaz (b. 1976, Los Angeles) lives and works in Los Angeles, she received her MFA from the California Institute of the Arts in 2003 and a BA from California State University Los Angeles in 1999. Diaz is a co-founder, alongside Mario Ybarra Jr., of the collective and community artist space Slanguage in Wilmington, CA.

Through a multidisciplinary practice spanning 45 years, encompassing documentary photography and portraiture, public murals, paintings, and pastel works, Valadez has cultivated a style that transcends genre designations. His work evokes a fluidity between multiple cultures and visual lexicons, effectively mirroring the unsettled experience of the Chicano identity. Valadez continues to pursue politically engaged work—a persistent voice championing generations of Chicano and Latinx communities.JOHN VALADEZ: Chaos Anime  presents new paintings that address the shifting global dynamics and social climates facing new generations of Chicanos today, alongside recent works that revisit earlier themes. Together, the works exhibit the breadth of the artist’s social commentaries and further contextualize his lauded approach to painting. Drawing from current events, cultural histories, city life, and such experiences filtered through lucid dreaming, Valadez implements realism, mannerism, abstraction, and montage as a vehicle for allegory and satire to ignite a myriad of socio-political conversations.Themes of invisible borders, sublime skies, and tempestuous seas, and juxtapositions between reality and dreams and the natural world versus the consequences of human interferences, are but some of the constants throughout the trove of Valadez’s urban proverbs. A pivotal moment in Valadez’s new body of work is his extension of Chicano Movement principles, speaking to global matters of displacement, gentrification, economic disparities, famine, the environment, and geopolitics.The exhibition’s title work, Chaos (2024)—among his most impressive and important work to date—is a new mural-scaled painting that dismantles the binaries and clichés of “haves and have-nots” narratives. Compositionally split in two, the work is Valadez’s read on today’s state of the union, a horror vacui of crises weighing social violence, environmental, and economic issues. The allegory presents new perspectives on borders and speaks to new generations of Chicanos making reverse migrations from the US to Mexico in hopes of improved cultural connections and quality of life.Shipwreck Cruise (2024) presents a critique of tourism’s effect on locals and their environments. Against a tranquil open sea, suspended in the aftermath of an event we are left to imagine, an acidic skyline of yellows disrupts the sea and sky in a haze indistinguishable from sunrise, sunset, or pollution. The mysterious scene presents a conceptual background for us to locate our complicities, empathies, and apathies, and follow the lead of the basket-donning woman at the helm of the ship, looking to the horizon for new solutions.Other recent works, Bambi Negra (2018) and Piernas Anime (2017), exemplify different approaches to Valadez’s wry satire, where it is not always extended outward but also takes criticality inward, including self-reflection in the case of Bambi Negra, depicting one of his dreams, and the cultural ruminations of Piernas Anime, influenced by the many layers of gender dynamics of Southern California car show culture. Piernas Anime, translated as “anime legs,” exemplifies an alloy of Valadez’s influences from the futurism aesthetics present in Japanese Anime, to mannerism and surrealism. The painting presents a tableau that subverts the male gaze and machismo hierarchies of classic car shows. With symbols, figures, and activities occurring in the foreground and background, the paintings resist hierarchies and contain multiple entry points.The works in Chaos Anime mark an exciting moment in Valadez’s career. Radical and indefatigable, Valadez’s allegories, cutting satire, masterful color, and playful yet dead-panned pastiche bring a refreshed sensibility of endurance despite the capriciousness of time.John Valadez (b.1951, Los Angeles, CA) is a painter, photographer, and muralist living and working in Los Angeles. Valadez studied at East Los Angeles Junior College from 1970-72 and earned his BFA at California State University, Long Beach in 1976. Valadez was active in early impactful collectives such as Los Four and Centro de Arte Publico. Valadez’s critically acclaimed 35-year retrospective, Santa Ana Condition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, CA, traveled to the National Mexican Museum of Art, Chicago, IL, and the Vincent Price Museum, East Los Angeles College, CA.

Marian,Los Angeles,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/tony-cragg-6/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Tony Cragg,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/tony-cragg/,"In the late 1960s, Cragg, intrigued by the observation and study of the material world, left the field of science to pursue a career as an artist. Over half a century and more than 400 solo exhibitions later, Cragg has established himself as one of the most influential sculptors working today, widely recognized for his lifelong fascination and virtuosity with materials. Marian Goodman Gallery has had the honor of representing Cragg for over forty years and is thrilled to bring this new exhibition of his work to Los Angeles.A significant presentation of works will be shown throughout the galleries, lobby, and garden, demonstrating the formal, material, and emotive range of sculpture that Cragg has been working on since 2018. As is distinctive of his oeuvre, these works are the outcome of a profound and restless fascination with material properties. Cragg works to capture the emotion, meaning, and beauty of a material, as well as the rational structure that is used to express its form beyond its modern utilitarian principles. As seen across the exhibition, the artist notably works in ‘families’ of sculpture—continuously inventing new forms in series that often share a single title. His works encourage us to think sculpturally, to consider material as an extension of the self.“For Tony Cragg, an engagement with material is an investigation into seeing beneath and beyond the surface of all things. In an epoch of information overload …. we are caught between the production of a flattened universe, where the forms we encounter are geometrically dull and predictable, and a materially active universe, where we are engaged with the structural and voluminous dynamics of all kinds of phenomena. What we believe to be seeing and what is happening at a microscopic level, that is between the world of surface impressions and the world of material engagements, is part of Cragg’s continued practice.” (from Thinking Sculpturally in Tony Cragg: A Rare Category of Objects)Cragg’s Hedge (2023) is from a series based originally on the artist’s childhood memory of playing in the hedgerows found in the English countryside. These Corten works take the literal form of a single or double hedge, which, at once organic and landscaped, is conveyed as a lively, interwoven tangle of rounded planes of steel. Proposing a counter-narrative to steel’s industrial past, the sculpture, with its lyrical nature, offers an entirely new strain of organic forms in Cragg’s work.The anthropomorphic Senders (2019) anticipates the interlocked forms of the Integers (2022) and the stratified layers of Masks (2021) whose forms summon an ancient and contemporary past. The new black Masks (2023), made from stacked planes of bog oak wood compressed to form striations of rounded strata, resembles organic structures, expressing its material substance in constructive form.Accumulations and communities of forms are often present in Cragg’s work, as evidenced in the work In No Time (2018) a wood sculpture made of abstracted forms in aggregate turning variably along an axis. Cragg’s interest in geological forms and his strategies of stratification, layering, and compilation can be seen here as well as in the nearby bronze Stack (2020). Similarly, the parity between a sculptural object and rocky landscape is evoked in the stone works, Off the Mountain (2023).In a complementary method, Versus (2023), a brilliant sculpture in bronze in a seemingly arrested state of movement, utilizes numerous patterned forms to radiate the energy of shifting profiles or jagged bodies in motion. This assemblage of dynamic elements expresses the significance of constituent parts to a whole, as well as the nature of mutability and the human experience. Versus plays on perceived realities, and represents a transient world in flux.The Incident works (2022-3) comprise a newer series that has recently provided a great fascination for the artist. Exclusively made in both Corten and stainless steel, they draw from the industrial, dominant presence of these materials in our built environment, but intrinsically resist their legacy of pre-formatted materials. In the Incidents, Cragg deliberately subverts our experience of them through vibrant, organic, and gravity-resisting forms that embody energy and verticality, and a free range of expression.The newest forms, Untitled (2023) in Corten steel and stainless steel, represent the exploration of a silhouette, or a profile that enlarges and expands into space on a human scale. As a sculptural form, it expresses a large volume outside of itself which becomes an extension of ourselves or can be seen as a tangible object.On view will be several works on paper from 2009-2021. For Cragg, drawing is an essential activity, often existing autonomously from the practice of sculpture, as a daily process or the expression of a concrete idea. Drawing allows visualization of a complex material world, or can be a step into the unknown. As Cragg says, “In contrast to sculpture, drawing never demands a real world scenario. Drawing steps into the world of dreams. ”The artist currently has a solo exhibition, Please Touch!, on view at Museum Kunstpalast Düsseldorf through 26 May 2024. Upcoming projects include a forthcoming exhibition at Castle Howard, UK, in early May which will be on view through September 2024.Tony Cragg was born in Liverpool, England, and has lived and worked in Wuppertal, Germany, since 1977.

Seemingly delicate, the weightless rice paper surfaces are reminiscent of the long, narrative registers of the 16th century Bayeux Tapestry or the subtlety of Giorgio Morandi’s still lives. The works transcend their contemporary trappings and genre associations to create something wholly originalLiminal Spaces offers a continuation of Krishnan’s work in the spirit of the Perennial Upanishadic dictum, vasudhaiva kutumbakam: “the world is one family.” In this exhibition, the artist builds her own sense of familial identity as a mother; the act of creation (both on the canvas and in her body) allowing her to “gain a fresh perspective and experience new life.” Each of her subjects, though rooted in the artist’s familiar past, are concentrated in the present and prompt the viewer to listen attentively to their stories.To achieve her signature textural quality, Krishnan layers together fibrous, brittle rice paper. Watercolors are then built up in thin washes of delicate blue and earth tones to achieve a supple, singular patina resembling an old map or sepia-toned photograph. The absence of the illusion of depth means Krishnan’s brushstrokes and subjects stand out sharply; the topography of the natural world blending with the architecture of village life. Her works on linen carry a similarly effortless quality.The entanglement between humanity and ecology manifests across this body of work on both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. In Womb, the title refers both to the figure of the pregnant woman and her reflection in the rippling pool of water she stands in. Saying bye features accumulation and repetition; the silent gesture of a waving hand of a mother echoes the communication of her baby in utero. With Krishnan’s brush, a cluster of trees becomes a portrait as much as a disparate group of individuals transforms into a landscape. “I started seeing the landscape as a metaphor for this internal transformation,” says Krishnan. “As a result, a realm beyond verbal expression started unfolding. The whole process was something organic, which led to a fragile ecosystem on the canvas.” In their fragility, Krishnan’s landscapes stand as their own and establish a nuanced perspective in contemporary portraiture.",Siji Krishnan: Liminal Spaces,"1227 North Highland Ave, CA 90038","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 26 Apr  - 8 Jun 2024  
Parrasch heijnen,Los Angeles,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/lois-dodd-ellen-siebers/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Lois Dodd,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/lois-dodd/,"Lois Dodd (b. 1927, Montclair, NJ) is known for her potent paintings, made en plein air, of the natural world - most often of specimens encountered throughout her Mid-Coast Maine property. In Dodd’s works, trees and branches are framed against the sky, cutting and darting across tonal grounds (Elm Tree in December, 2020); flowering plants stand at attention in bud and bloom (Mayberry, 2023 and Apple Tree in Bloom - May, 2021); seed pods and pine cones are depicted at close range, a study of their natural geometries (Dried Pods, 2022 and Pine Cone, 2023). The artist’s long-term pursuit of beauty is depicted in each work through a series of the quick-succession decisions necessitated by her single-sitting, plein air methodology.Dodd’s palette is fantastical, barely: each image seems to be rendered to express what she feels as much as what she sees during her deeply observational process. In a 2007 conversation with Bill Maynes, Dodd described her experience employing this strategy, “Not everybody seems to see the world that they’re living in… and it’s such a kick, really seeing things.” Impossibly fluorescent greens, luminous mauve, and porous aqua resonate in a harmonious evocation of the richness, the lushness, of the living world. Dodd’s paintings, encapsulations of a painter’s view of her world, put plain beauty on full display.Ellen Siebers (b. 1986, Madison, WI) makes highly atmospheric, evocative paintings, with an eye, too, toward life, nature, and quotidian phenomena. In Siebers’ works and process, memory plays a central role; rather than employing a strict plein air strategy, as Dodd does, Siebers’ paintings are often descriptions of scenes or experiences which she studied and reflected upon at length. Siebers has described this process as one which demands practice: looking and seeing - two related but distinct acts - come before rehearsing and testing her memory, all in anticipation of returning to the studio to develop and render her paintings. In works like dusk, 2024, a J.M.W. Turner-esque image of a glowing sun setting over its own reflection, Siebers’ palette calls to mind a recollection of a vista; Payne’s grey and burnt umber set the dusky stage, and a raw sienna orb floats downward, toward its counterpart below.Much as in Dodd’s works, Siebers’ paintings call a feeling to mind. In plums, 2024, cool light illuminates round fruits on an indeterminate surface, recalling the preciousness of stone fruit before spring’s arrival - a balm, and reminder of anticipated plentitude, in the barren winter months. Similarly, two moths, 2024, uses strategies of illumination - imagine a candle, excluded in Siebers’ framing, brightening the forms from below, as in Georges de la Tour’s baroque works; and, above, consider the rich, warm, evening light, “magic hour” - to evoke a sensation of awe. Siebers’ unique, trademark mode of painterly looseness, most readily visualized by conspicuous brushstrokes and striations of her brushes’ fibers, allows a viewer a moment’s glimpse into the pull of her forearm or flick of her wrist through the developing image, wrought with feeling engendered by the distance of observational memory.As Siebers considers her long standing appreciation for Dodd’s works and practice, she notes that “Observation gives way to the importance of each brush stroke, in devotion to process.” Lois Dodd and Ellen Siebers undeniably share a mutual interest in not just the fundamentals of painting but the beauty of their earthly surroundings. With an eye toward this affinity, Siebers has noted:“The impulse to create work that relates to the concept of beauty has at times felt vulnerable. Unlike historically male counterparts, when a woman is interested in beauty it is often linked to femininity or sentimentality…. However, historically when they are tied to women artists, those concepts lack intellectual rigor. For me, [Lois Dodd’s] work challenges this, never paying it any mind. This helped inspire me to consider the idea of beauty as a serious conceptual conceit.”To that end, in both Dodd’s and Siebers’ works, images of life – animal, vegetable, mineral – are rendered, often transforming the quotidian into something extraordinary. At the root, both Ellen Siebers and Lois Dodd are engaged with and participating in the millenias-long tradition of their media. Their works revel in the possibility of beauty and visual poetry - and the capacity to depict a fleeting experience or sensation - in each lived moment.Lois Dodd has dedicated over seven decades to capturing her immediate surroundings at home in Manhattan’s Lower East Side, rural Mid-Coast Maine, and the Delaware Water Gap. Dodd studied at the Cooper Union in the late 1940s. She was one of the five founding members of the legendary Tanager Gallery, among the first artist-run cooperative galleries in New York, and is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Academy. Since 1954, her work has been the subject of over seventy one-person exhibitions. Her small, intimate paintings are typically completed in a single plein-air sitting, featuring varied subjects like New England outbuildings, vibrant summer gardens, dried plants, moonlit skies, and interior window views. Dodd revisits familiar motifs throughout the year, yielding dramatically different results. As Lucy R. Lippard emphasizes, Dodd’s paintings are “like small poems composed with deceptively simple words,” resonating with viewers long after the initial encounter. Lois Dodd's exhibition is presented in cooperation with Alexandre Gallery, New York.Ellen Siebers is a painter based in Hudson, NY. She received her BFA from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2008 and her MFA from the University of Iowa in 2012. Siebers was awarded the Elizabeth Greenshields Grant (2023), Vermont Studio Center Grant (2014), the University of Iowa Quarter-time Teaching Assistantship (2009-12), the Iowa Quarter-time Fellowship (2009), and the Mildred Pelzer Lynch Fellowship (2011-12).

Perrotin Los Angeles,Los Angeles,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/mschf-art-2/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",MSCHF,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/mschf/,"In 1939, the Del Mar Theatre burst onto California’s cinema scene with Frank Capra’s “You Can’t Take It with You.” Throughout the next eight decades, the space has transformed and changed hands. Most recently, Perrotin Los Angeles took possession of the building, converting it into an art gallery while preserving the theater’s historical marquee. An auditorium enhanced by Johnston Marklee serves as the central gallery space, where art collective MSCHF exhibits their second Perrotin solo presentation, Art 2. The collective stages a series of installations bound by the theme of a second act. In Tinseltown, where sequels seem inevitable, MSCHF takes on the role of superhero and villain. Drop after drop, they keep returning — taking us for a joyride. MSCHF shapeshifts between art collective and fashion company, traversing multiple dimensions while collectors, consumers, gamers and friends are subjects of their performative exercises.In 2021, MSCHF acquired Fairies, an Andy Warhol ink-on-paper drawing. They reproduced 999 identical copies, mixed them with the original, and sold each for $250 at Drop #59, Museum of Forgeries. In a matter of minutes, all 1,000 artworks sold out. If their website hadn’t fully disclosed their speculative proposition of erasing provenance from this unique work, MSCHF may well be in orange jumpsuits. 2024’s art world headlines trumpet the industry’s fixation on authenticity, from the ongoing saga of Leonardo Da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi to Rembrandt’s The Adoration of the Kings. Riding on this wave of absurdity in attribution and perceived value, MSCHF transfers its online project to a gallery context. Their sophomore iteration revolves around Pablo Picasso’s Le Poisson, a carved wooden artifact that fits in the palm of your hand. Replicated 249 times, this sculpture is recast as a school of fish adorning one long wall. The bait is twofold: a collector may purchase the entire installation, guaranteeing their “catch” of an original Picasso. Or 250 frenzied fans vote with their dollars to democratize accessibility over art pedigree.MSCHF’s Drop #84 Key4All demonstrates what can happen when thousands of people across the country can access a single car via duplicate keys. While the art collective originally predicted a Grand Theft Auto competition of participants stealing the 2004 Chrysler PT Cruiser from one another, the results revealed a dedicated, caring community. Participants constantly repaired, repainted, and accessorized the vehicular protagonist as it winded its way to Truckee, California, its final resting place where it broke down. A standout of this gallery exhibition, the Public Universal Car, now a relic, is accompanied by documentation and ephemera of its almost year-long transatlantic trek. Its static state recalls Ant Farm’s infamous public sculpture, Cadillac Ranch. This work explored alternatives to corporate architecture and featured ten junked Cadillacs half-buried in a Texas field. When the Cruiser is purchased, the proceeds will allow MSCHF to place a Key4All transceiver into a new vehicle, resurrecting the project to don its treads once more.If you’re on the internet, there was no escaping 2023’s ubiquitous Big Red Boot (BRB). The boot became an overnight sensation when the Astro Boy cartoon image was realized as a seamless construction of molded rubber. We were bombarded with pictures of celebrities stylishly rocking them, then influencers, and finally, the whole wide world. In a matter of weeks, the project’s approval rating went from brilliant to despicable. Internally, MSCHF grappled with the conundrum of popularity subsuming the art project’s intention: mastering craftsmanship through the platonic ideal of exaggerated footwear. In a humorous double entendre, Bootlegs (in a series of six) is the Big Red Boot fitted with partially hairy legs, a reincarnation of an iconic image hijacked by meme culture.Another instance of the transformative power of virality brings us to a small church in the Spanish village of Borja. A deteriorating painting once known as Ecco Homo resided here for many years when a beloved parishioner took it upon herself to improve the work in 2012. However, she lacked the touch of a skilled restorer, and the suffering countenance of Jesus Christ was subsequently rebaptized by the media as Monkey Christ, Potato Jesus or Beast Jesus. While the aesthetic results were disastrous, thousands of curious internet pilgrims descended, bringing a tourism boom to the town. This meme-fied conversion of destruction to creation inspired MSCHF’s series Botched Masters. The collective purchased a handful of 17th and 18th century religious paintings, then “restored” aspects of each work, hoping to emulate the indie magic of Borja. In “destroying” the work, does their hand bring new value to the revised creation? Still to be scripted.In the fast-moving world of fashion, there are three reigning accessory categories: shoes, bags, and frames. MSCHF’s portfolio includes the first two (and there are whispers of a future eyewear drop). For their third bag venture deconstructing the luxury product, the aptly named Microscopic Handbags are tiny and only viewable by microscope. Co-opting a biomedical industry technique, MSCHF leveraged 3D printing based on a two-photon polymerization for ultraprecise micro- fabrication in liquid resin. Each of the five works produced for this exhibition salute renowned bag makers: Bottega Veneta, Gucci, Hermes, Jacquemus, and Telfar. Probing lineage and legitimacy, these artworks are the 21st century portrayal of the ancient Indian fable featuring two weavers who deceive a king by presenting him with a garment that can only be seen by the competent. Hoodwinked, the emperor parades nude in his supposed magnificent robe, with his court concurring until a child blurts out, “The emperor has no clothes.” With Microscopic Handbags, MSCHF co-stars as both weaver and child, a testament to their subversive cosplay.MSCHF proves spectacle comes in all shapes and sizes, centering their exhibition with an exclamation point, Touch Me Sculpture One More Time. Conjuring Michaelangelo and Bernini, the bronze work is a group of friends in a chaotic embrace. The tangled bodies stand on a pentagonal pedestal, edged with an LED readout flashing a set of numbers. MSCHF would like the digits to remain a mystery until the art work is experienced in the gallery.Spoiler alert: you are likely to laugh out loud.

Working on shaped stretchers, Jorden pulls, stretches, and incises linen to wrap around convex and concave curves. Jorden often refers to landscape and qualities of light in her work, associating the exposed areas of linen with the color and texture of the sandy soil of Southern California, where she resides.  ""My paintings are improvisations, exploring qualities of reflection, energy, movement, magnetism, and light.” Jorden comments. In a recent essay, she writes that each painting begins with a proposition, what she describes as ""an impetus to begin or enter.” Propositions are basic building blocks in Jorden's work, similar to those in logic or calculus. A proposition could be a color relation, an applied mark on bare linen, the shape of a given canvas, or the relation between two separate canvases in a multiple-canvas work.  ""Another recent inspiration, especially while making this body of work is the improvisational compositions of musicians and sound artists. I’ve recently been listening to interviews with contemporary composers.

Cloth is sacred in many African societies – it is woven in the home, primarily by women, based on traditions that have been passed down over generations. Its domestic connotations provide it a texture and intimacy that other art practices lack. Yet cloth is currency as well as culture – opening the doors to division and conflict. For this reason, many of the artists in this exhibition use second-hand or natural fibers, thereby stitching their stories into larger communal narratives.Agnes Waruguru, Fiker Solomon, and Elfreda Fakoya deploy natural dyes and fibers to explore the relationship between their communities and the natural world, rooting their work in the physical landscapes they inhabit and the skills they have accumulated and internalized from other women in their lives. Layering acrylic paint and natural pigment on cotton and watercolor paper, Waruguru maps what she calls “memoryscapes” while Solomon weaves together biodegradable and natural materials such as jute to craft complex geographies that underscore the interdependence between nature and society. Likewise, Fakoya’s series, Seeds of Becoming, constructs hanging leather tapestries that reflect intergenerational lineages and the path toward self-realization.Other works in the exhibition speak to the influence of respectively Western commodities and gendered expectations, which often conflict with indigenous value systems and personal agency. In Beauty Lesson 1 - Never Clean Your Face with Water (2022), Sedireng Mothibatsela paints onto a linen canvas a Johnson & Johnson baby oil bottle, an item used by her South African grandmother that highlights the impact of globalization and the pervasive search for a Western beauty ideal. Also touching on gendered, ritualist practices, Rawan Abbas confronts arbitrary valuation systems, especially as they relate to the removal and loss of body hair. In I Cut It So It Doesn’t Break My Neck (2024), a long, winding wig made out of synthetic hair and fibers as a serpent might wrap around its prey, calls attention to the complex politics of sexual decorum in Egyptian society.While the works above investigate the impact of societal ideals, Yoma Emore creates works that illustrate complex diasporic identities. Emore’s Traveler’s Map (2023) series combines jute, a textile commonly used in traditional Nigerian weaving practices, with painted text in order to recreate new geographies out of existing maps with the goal of documenting the lived experiences of those on the margins, stories that risk being permanently erased.Gladys Kalichini challenges the prospect of erasure by promulgating new practices of story-telling and collaboration, bringing together a group of women from Los Angeles to source fabric from Downtown Los Angeles, share oral histories and explore new rituals while co-creating a new installation. In doing so, Kalichini illustrates the ways in which nurturing dormant histories have the power to generate new collective memories.By bringing these disparate artists and their respective cultural practices together in one room, this exhibition uncovers the political, social, and cultural valence of textile in contemporary African art. Soft, pliable, and unrelentingly ritualistic, textile practices reveal connections and tensions between past, present, and future that we often overlook.The artists participating in this exhibition are:Rawan Abbas, EgyptYoma Emore, NigeriaElfreda Fakoya, NigeriaGladys Kalichini, ZambiaSedireng Mothibatsela, BotswanaFiker Solomon, EthiopiaAgnes Waruguru, KenyaRele is committed to nurturing artists and cultural practitioners from across the African continent, the extended Global South, diasporic communities, and beyond.

These modifications became further translated through Havekost’s manual process of painting. The final image did not reflect a photographic precision, but rather a series of transient moments that capture an abstracted perception. The intentional ‘errors’ make the image appear more natural and visually pleasing, while the attenuated distortion transforms an instance of banality into one of harmonious beauty.Eberhard Havekost (1967–2019) was born in Dresden, Germany, the son of a sculptor and a taxidermist. As a student of the renowned Dresden Kreuzschule, he sang with the Kreuzchor and participated in international concert tours until his voice changed. After graduating in the mid-eighties, he completed his training as a stonemason. Before the fall of the wall, Havekost fled from East to West Germany via Budapest in 1989. From 1991 to 1996, he studied painting at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, finishing his time as a master student of Ralf Kerbach. In 1995, he had his first solo exhibition at Galerie Gebr. Lehmann in Dresden. Havekost received a scholarship in the mid-nineties to go to Frankfurt, where he immersed himself in the techno club scene, and later moved to Berlin where he lived and worked for the rest of his life. In 2010, Havekost was appointed Professor of Painting at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf.Havekost’s work has been presented in numerous solo exhibitions at institutions such as the Rudolfinum, Prague, Czech Republic; Museum der Moderne, Salzburg, Austria; Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, Germany; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt, Germany; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, the Netherlands and Kunstmuseum, Wolfsburg, Germany.

Rather than favoring the conventional illusion of shared time and space, here each actor was filmed separately, thousands of miles and often months apart, a method integral to its story of human connection made only through effort. Adapted for a gallery setting, the work now adds new dimensions both thematically and quite literally, spreading the performances across three strategically placed screens within a space enclosed by a massive curtain (evoking the intimacy and proportions of a train car). The viewer is immersed, as in a dream of being “in the middle of the movie,” invited to physically navigate and interact with the exchanges surrounding them.As the forced spatial perspective of the single-screen cinema is dissolved, so is its temporal experience—the non-linear structure of the story particularly well-suited to a gallery environment with no set start or end time, where no one viewer’s encounter will quite replicate another’s. Unlike a movie, there is no passive viewing, only personal interpretation and discovery.“There There” demonstrates Bujalski’s versatility and forms a unique contribution to the evolving dialogue between cinema and installation work.
