Perrotin,Tokyo,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/robin-f-williams-undying/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Perrotin-Tokyo-new.jpg,Robin F. Williams,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/robin-f-williams/,"Undying extends Williams’s enduring engagement with the representation of women and the construction of gender in portraiture, advertising, folklore, social media, and film. Her vivid imagery is as diverse as her source material. Known for highly stylized figures composed through layers of brushwork, marbling, airbrushing, sponging, and stenciling, Williams often employs an arsenal of tools more familiar to crafting than to easel painting. These techniques anchor the lush opticality of her images in haptic relatability, humbling the gravitas of oil painting while creating richly textured surfaces that reward careful looking.Williams herself is a close observer. While creating Undying, she recalled looking for “the painting” in films, searching for shots where story and composition crystallized into an emotional punch. The resulting paintings, based on film stills, offer themselves up as a type of fan fiction that attenuates what is otherwise a fleeting erotic exchange. The Man Who Fell to Earth (2023), Persona (2023), Blue Velvet (2023), and Thirst (2023) offer a study in cinematic convention: all feature women on their backs under hulking partners, captured from the intrusive vantage point of an over-the-shoulder shot. Blacula (2023) and Videodrome (2023) study a slightly different trope, staging women who luxuriate under the influence of sinister forces beyond the frame. They may later meet their demise, but here, they are the only girl in the world.The ambiguity of gendered pleasure and its mediation on film formed the central topic of early feminist theory. Indeed, the heyday of b-movie slashers in the 1970s was accompanied by a wave of canonical texts including Laura Mulvey’s treatise on visual pleasure and narrative cinema. (1) The essay posited that film was a visual language developed by men for men, whose very structure preclude the possibility of female agency. Scholars since have insisted on greater complexity. Carol J. Clover’s concept of the “final girl” and Linda Williams theory of excessive emotion as cathartic cinematic experience offer models of identification for audiences of any gender to enjoy horror films as embodied subjects. (2) And yet the idea of enjoyment sits uneasily with horror. Our pleasure as viewers is often proportional to the misery that unfolds on screen. For example, the “final girl” is always tortured and miraculously survives, only to be condemned to return, again and again, in sequel after sequel, to face down the killer once more. What do we extract from these female protagonists? Film theorist Linda Williams suggests that extreme violence, sex, and emotion are hallmarks of the genre, whose excesses audiences consume like the vampires they watch on screen. (3) Taken together, the works in Undying deliver a closely cropped meditation on the dynamics of the vampiric in both filmic subject and spectator alike.As with vampires and their victims, in Williams’s paintings, opposites attract. The artist plays secondary and tertiary colors off one another to undergird the pictures with maximum tension. Vermillion and teal vibrate across the canvass in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Videodrome, and Thirst. Red and green clash in Persona. Grafting the laws of attraction onto the dogma of the color wheel, Williams plays at the edge of representation: complimentary colors provide maximum contrast when paired together but result in gray obliteration when fully combined. Photorealistic as they may appear, these paintings in fact hover at the edge of legibility. One brush stroke out of place, and the integrity of the whole would collapse.Williams locates the fine line between the erotic flirtation of colors versus the gray oblivion of their total imbrication; between the only girl and the “final girl”; and between the romance of an undying love versus the horror of the undead. Despite the ambiguity of the paintings, Williams wryly points out that their source films “are all tragedies, in the end.” The works in Undying walk the tightrope between self-determination and self-destruction, snaring both fictional subjects and real-time viewers in the frisson of a suspended moment where—as in good fan fiction—another ending is always possible.-Katherine Rochester, PhD(1) Laura Mulvey, “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,” Screen 16, no. 3 (Autumn 1975): 6–18.(2) Carol J.

Taka Ishii Gallery,Tokyo,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/dan-graham-8/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Taka-Ishii-interior.jpg,Dan Graham,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/dan-graham/,"The exhibition consists of comprehensive collections of Graham’s work, and chronological development of his long career as an artist, described himself as a ‘provocateur’ and ‘rebel’. Firstly, a long run series of the color photographs, which was started from Homes for America (1966-67), when his analytical bent first appeared. Homes for America is a sequence of photos of suburban development in New Jersey, accompanied by a text charting the economics of land use and the obsolescence of architecture and craftsmanship. In this exhibition, half of the works are from Homes for America, and the second half is a book from Dan Graham’s New Jersey (2012). The photographs he took in 2006, occasion of exhibition and research collaboration, a series of study trips that Graham conducted with faculty from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) and other guests.A series of two juxtaposed photographs are also introduced, taken in the same suburban cityscapes in 1960s, 80s, or 2008, which show a multilayered element of repetition and difference, both spatially and temporally. A series of incorporating two mirrors to practice intersubjective realms is also introduced which started to be seen in the 1970s. Graham’s never changed interest in New Jersey, buildings, kitsch, and America can be seen through the series.Secondly, the model which shows Graham’s interest in psychology and gaze, Clinic for a Suburban Site (1978). A speculative project that raises questions about the boundaries between public and private, the concepts of “inside” and “outside,” and the “traditional disposition of the family space” according to Graham. The facade of a building in an apparently typical American suburb has been replaced by glass, while the house’s interior is divided into public and private sections by a mirror. In doing so, Graham critiques the modernist ideal that the literal transparency of glass in architecture would also lead to social transparency. At the same time that the house’s inhabitants can gaze at the environment and activity outside, they themselves become objects on display, and this concept is connected to Graham’s next development of the pavilion series.Graham’s critical engagement manifests most alluringly in the glass and mirrored pavilions, which he has designed since the late 1970s. The Two-way mirrors within the pavilion, create unexpected reflections and voyeuristic elements simultaneously watching oneself and being able to watch others. Three models of the pavilion is Graham’s last work unveiled in 2022, poised between sculpture and architecture, drawing attention as instruments of expression, psychological strongholds, makers of social change and prisms through which we view others and ourselves.Dan Graham was born in 1942 in Urbana, Illinois, raised in Winfield Township, New Jersey. For fifty years, he had spent most of his career in New York and passed away in 2022.Graham’s work has been included in exhibitions at the Red Brick Art Museum, Beijing, China (2017); the Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio (2016); MAMO, Marseille, France (2015); the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2014); the De Pont Foundation, Tillburg, Netherlands (2014); a traveling retrospective which began at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 2009 and traveled to the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota.Graham participated in the Venice Biennale in 2005, 2003, 1976 and multiple Documentas (1997, 1992, 1982, 1977, 1972). He was awarded the American Academy of Arts and Letters award, New York in 2010; the French Vermeil Medal by the city of Paris in 2001 and the Skowhegan Medal for Mixed Media, New York, 1992.Within Japan, the exhibition, Dan Graham by Dan Graham, was first presented at the Chiba City Museum of Art and subsequently traveled to the Kitakyushu Municipal Museum of Art, both in 2004.",Dan Graham,"6-5-24 3F Roppongi, Minato-ku, #106-0032",Tue-Sat 12-7pm, 28 May  - 22 Jun 2024
