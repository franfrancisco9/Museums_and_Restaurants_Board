The show title takes its name from the color pigment used by the artist as a recurring motif in the series Milori Blue 57th Street to depict the skyscrapers that occupy Manhattan’s 57th Street. By taking such real-world matters then abstracting and translating them onto a canvas for exhibition and inspection, Larsen succeeds in re-contextualizing what otherwise tends to be easily disregarded. Consequently, she invents a novel subjective reality––one in which monochromatic structures alluding to silhouettes of buildings dynamically tower over the viewer and dramatically contorting shapes suspend themselves against flat backdrops made up of saturated yellows, oranges, and greens.In the process of constructing her narrative of reality, Larsen naturally invites our participation. Larsen’s anti-representational mode of working enables the artist to effectively displace the subject matter from their origin and the viewer to impart new meanings to the works by drawing upon their personal interpretations and emotional responses. For instance, in Raw Umber X (2023), a brown pillar-like shape stretches diagonally across the linen canvas painted mustard yellow. At first glance, the piece seemingly depicts an urban high-rise hovering over the viewer as with many others created by Larsen. However, closer viewings then give rise to a myriad of possibilities: a chimney peeking out from the rooftop of a suburban home, an elongated shadow imprinted on the ground, an upside-down view of the leg of a wooden chair, et cetera. The search for meaning therefore becomes a unique introspective experience for each individual viewer, with no answer being the right answer.To draw from reality then question and dispute it to make way for something beautiful to emerge––such is the true power of Larsen’s paintings.Liv Mette Larsen (b. 1952) was born in Oslo, Norway.

While in the marriage, she felt there could only be one sculptor, and so it was not until 1952 that she gained the success, freedom, and confidence to dare to experiment in new media and her focus shifted entirely to sculpture. This exhibition will feature several early sculptures from the 1950s and 1960s, mostly created with the lost-wax process.An entire gallery will be devoted to her rarely known series of assemblages from the 1970s called I Ching. Louise Nevelson introduced Dehner to John Cage, whose sounds and theories influenced this body of work. Untitled (I Ching) is totemic in feel, made from thin wood pieces placed together in rhythmic patterns. Towards the end of her career, Dehner started working with fabricators to fulfill her dream of making large-scale sculpture. The centerpiece to the exhibition is one the largest she ever created called Prelude and Fugue from 1989, standing over eight feet tall and eight feet wide made from painted black steel. Demeter’s Harrow (1990) is a large-scale playful sculpture created by connecting geometric forms made from Corten Steel.Joan Marter, Ph.D., President of the Dorothy Dehner Foundation, through her research and writing has placed Dehner in the context of other Abstract Expressionists resulting in many recent accolades. In 2023, Dehner was the feature article in the Woman’s Art Journal, “Dorothy Dehner and the Women Sculptors Among the Abstract Expressionists,” which discusses Dehner’s close friendship with Louise Nevelson. Dehner has been included in numerous group exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, most recently in Making Space: Women Artists and Postwar Abstraction (2017). Dehner’s totemic sculpture Encounter is currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.Dehner is situated in the canon of Abstract Expressionist sculptors alongside Nevelson, Louise Bourgeois, Herbert Ferber, Ibram Lassaw, David Hare, and David Smith. Her work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Museum of Women in the Arts, Storm King Art Center, The British Museum, and Dresden Museum, among many others.

David Richard Gallery,New York Chelsea,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/nate-ethier-heavy-light/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Nathan Ethier,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/nate-ethier/,"Layering of saturated and desaturated colors using meticulously applied translucent glazes with overlapping and opposing horizontal and vertical brush strokes that emulate the warp and weft of woven textiles in an overall canvas-filling pattern has been a mainstay of Ethier’s studio practice for years. While the process and use of all over patterns remains constant, the key feature in this newest body of work is the presence of a centrally located focal point comprised of bright and vividly colored rectilinear and curvilinear shapes against a background of all over geometric forms and patterns in desaturated hues of complimentary and tonal values.Ethier achieves compositional harmonies through his all-over patterned grounds that persist in form, thus anchoring the composition, while varying in the upper most hues that the viewer sees through the building of successive layers of translucent color applied selectively in newly applied shapes over the surface of the canvas as noted above. The new brighter and vividly colored focal point, the “figure” in the parlance of “figure-ground” relationships, emerges from the ground through this sequential process of adding additional patterns of new curved and geometric shapes and leveraging color theory to achieve harmonic palettes. Sometimes the shapes of the ground remain as grids of squares or rotated to create diamond shapes and grided patterns.According to Ethier in a recent written statement: “The compositions of these pictures are simultaneously ‘all over’, and not. The collections of illuminated shapes seem to disrupt the underlying grid; however, they depend on its very structure to exist as part of the image. These paintings are hard edge and soft edge, all at once.”Reminiscent of Julian Stanczak, the important color abstract painter famous for his optical and illusory compositions in the 1960s and 70s, and his approach to sequentially layering colors on top of the patterned layer below using masking tape to successively reveal only the shapes to be painted with the new hue. The difference is Stanczak almost always used opaque colors to cover over selective portions of the grid of colors below. Ethier, however, uses translucent colors so that the color below becomes part of and transformed selectively into a different color specifically within the desired shape that, in his case, will become part of the emerging figure in the ultimate foreground. Another interesting comparison between the generationally diverse artists is the repetition of certain small motifs or structures of contrasting colors that are uniformly gridded or patterned across the canvas surface. Stanczak referred to these as “activation elements” because they excite the viewer’s eye, causing the brain to try and make sense of the frenetic marks which in turn makes the viewer more susceptible to the power of suggestion. In other words, the activation elements help challenge the viewer’s visual perception.The final additions in Ethier’s newest paintings are often large circular discs, ovals, squares, or teardrops in specific arrays and highly contrasting translucent hues of lavender, light grey, bright amber, or lighter values of colors within the composition to either elevate the centrally located figure by framing it or directionally drawing the viewer’s eye to it, or even veiling and slightly obfuscating the figure. In the painting, “Magical Thinking” the large discs on the upper-most layer of canvas gives the figure a slight anthropomorphic reference, it almost appears as the head and eyes of an owl.The centrally located figures are interesting shapes in and of themselves, moving the compositions into an optical and illusory aesthetic and making the viewer ponder astral, mystical, or existential realms. The most dimensional of the structures is the bi-partite curvaceous structure resembling a spinning top or dumbbells, possibly even an electron map (for the chemists out there). The interior shapes and patterning utilize a curved dome-shaped form that reads as a sliver off the edge of a circle and provides powerful kinetic, whirling, and illusory imagery. Other structures of the figure range from spherical orbs that are floating freely or slightly resting upon the dumbbell structure noted above or just a portion of it such that there is a slight botanical nod to perhaps the pedicle of a flower or fruiting structures. Still, in others, the sphere morphs into an oval or elliptical shape. Again, the combination of the high contrast, high-key colors and curves of the interior shapes and patterns imbue the structures with pulsating and spinning kinetic movement.Ethier recently commented on his sources of inspiration, “Inspiration for the shapes and motifs at play in this work came from the dappling effect of sunlight through forest canopies, stained glass arrangements, mycology, sun angle charts, wind patterns, bird murmuration, the Moon, concert lighting, botanical order, loud music on a clear day, and surely many other subconscious interventions.”The artist’s title for the exhibition, “Heavy Light”, is an interesting play on words. It could be that both “heavy” and “light’ pertain to weight, either as a physical mass or visual size of an artwork on a wall and within a space, meaning the painting’s pictorial impact. If “heavy” is an adjective modifying “light” then that could imply the paintings are very luminous, bright and radiant. Actually, both interpretations are true and apply to Ethier’s paintings. His command of color and intuition for juxtaposing hues to leverage interactions and optical effects creates the internal energy and sets the mood for each painting. To that end, Ethier recently wrote, “The illusion of projected light conveyed in my pictures gives each one of them a sense of life, action, and exuberant coexistence with the viewer.”About Nathan Ethier:Nate Ethier’s artworks have been exhibited at Auxier/Kline, NY; Danese/Corey, NY; LMAKgallery, NY; Minus Space, NY; Geoffery Young Gallery, MA; Nancy Margois Gallery, NY; The Boiler/Pierogi Gallery, NY; Morgan Lehman Gallery, NY; and at institutes such as the Susquehanna Art Museum, PA; Boston University, MA; Georgia Southern Univeristy, GA.

Begun in 1971, the Good Paintings are differentiated from Jenney’s previous body of work, which he designated as Bad Paintings (1969–70) after curator Marcia Tucker’s 1978 New Museum exhibition “Bad” Painting, which included his work. Painted in acrylic in a loose, gestural style, the Bad Paintings represent relationships between people and things, while upending preconceptions of connoisseurship and “good taste.” The Good Paintings are instead exacting studies of nature in oil paint on wooden panels.Jenney’s Good Paintings impart the experience of observing the North American landscape at close range, in contrast with the expansive vistas of untamed wilderness typical of the historical Hudson River School. While describing the natural world, many of the works also remind us that the environment is never far removed from human intervention. Jenney’s handmade black wooden frames are integral to these works, which he regards as “painted sculpture.” Playing off the classical conception of a painting as a window into fictive space, the frames create an architectural foreground, asserting their status as physical objects. The works’ mediated nature is further emphasized by the inclusion of titles stenciled in uppercase serif lettering.In the Good Paintings, “good” is both a formal and a conceptual label as seen through Jenney’s refined use of paint and color, and his approach to themes of universal significance, such as the artist’s cultural role, climate change, and notions of societal progress. Depicting a sky without a horizon, Atmosphere (1985) emphasizes diffuse, glowing sunlight. Stretching over twelve and a half feet wide in a narrow horizontal format, North America Divided (1992–99) pictures a tree stump and bands of cirrus clouds together with a worn wooden fence, strands of barbed wire, and the remains of wires and porcelain insulators indicating that it was once electrified. Related paintings feature divisions within the landscape, with fence posts, paths, stone walls, and other constructions demarcating space.North American Aquatica (2006–07) renders a body of water in turbulent brushstrokes of deep blue and white, inspired by Baltic currents. North American Summer (2019–20) presents the forms of a maple tree’s leaves and branches against a background of mottled brushstrokes in brown and bright green that suggest a manicured lawn, the composition’s striking vantage point establishing contrast between its natural and artificial aspects. With a sense of subjectivity that verges on the mythological, the Good Paintings convey the coexistence of their subjects in both the real and the imagined world.",Neil Jenney: Idealism Is Unavoidable,"541 West 24th Street, NY 10011",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 2 May  - 22 Jun 2024

Cattelan is, in the words of the exhibition’s curator Francesco Bonami, “the most famous Italian artist since Caravaggio.” While the claim may seem overblown, the popularity of the artist’s recent exhibitions at UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing, and the Leeum Museum of Art, Seoul, confirm his ability to engage both art-world audiences and a global public.Cattelan’s work will also be on view as part of the Vatican’s exhibition for the Holy See Pavilion at the 60th Biennale di Venezia (April 20–November 24).",Maurizio Cattelan: Sunday | Curated by Francesco Bonami,"522 West 21st Street, NY 10011",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 30 Apr  - 15 Jun 2024  
Hauser,New York Chelsea,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/rita-ackermann-splits/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Rita Ackermann,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/rita-ackermann/,"Dr. Pamela Kort on Rita Ackermann’s exhibitions:SplitsTitled ‘Splits,’ Ackermann’s latest paintings mark a pinnacle in the artist’s ongoing concern with the creation of dynamic, moving images. In these canvases, forms cascade downward and upward, at times merging seamlessly into one another. To optimize the potential of such chance transformative processes, Ackermann conceptualized the canvas as divided into three screens, as she aptly calls them. This enabled her not only to guide the flow of line and paint, but also to forestall the coalescence of drawing and painting. No sketch prefigured the images that surfaced, except those carved into the recesses of her memory. Instead, Ackermann allowed an instinctive force to guide her hand as it moved across the fields before her.The fluctuation between the screens she populated with diaphanous lines and those carrying weightier, gestural strokes of color also conspired to infuse the paintings with an unexpected rhythm. In ‘Shut Eye’ (2023), for example, two screens brimming with fragments of drawn shapes entice the eye to actively pull open the middle register and thereby show more of the painted forms within. This occurs even as the upper and lower screens seem to press inward, creating a dynamic tension between revelation and concealment. To enhance this impression, Ackermann occasionally used luminous yellow pigment to further instill in these paintings a sense of lightness and transparency.Composed as a sequence of stacked-up semi-translucent frames, these canvases can also be seen as the visual equivalent of images imprinted on a film strip. Ackermann, in fact, draws parallels between the transformative essence of the images in the ‘Splits’ and the dynamic permutations observed when montaged photographic images are projected in a cinema. In both mediums, meaning opens in the infinitesimal split between what the eye sees and the elusive. There, a unique motion also unfolds, one that oscillates between appearance and truth. In all these paintings, there is mystery, one that hints at the presence of the profound and unknowable. Through their enigmatic allure, the ‘Splits’ encourage the viewer to ponder the ineffable, reminding us that while transcendence eludes sight, its essence can nonetheless reveal itself.Splits: Printing | PaintingIn the thick of bringing to canvas the metamorphic forms that would become the ‘Splits,’ Ackermann embarked on a new artistic endeavor, delving into the realm of printmaking. In the resultant seven large-scale silkscreens, which she produced in collaboration with master printer Keigo Takahashi, her concern with making manifest such images became imbued with a related objective: the transformation of paintings into prints, without recourse to the reproduction of a model. Though these silkscreens diverge from the compositional principles of the ‘Splits,’ like them they probe the boundaries of optical perception. To emphasize this, the exhibition includes two recent paintings. One of these—’The Rule of Nature’ (2023)—which belongs to the ‘Splits,’ even bears the marks of Ackermann’s concern with combining monotype printing with painting. Viewers who perceive that will nevertheless find it difficult to distinguish between the look of the other painting—’Misfit’ (2023)—and the silkscreens.This visual feat owes just as much to the artist’s decision to approach the making of these silkscreens as though she were working on a canvas, as to any sleight of the hand enabled by their production. Ackermann began by layering drawings onto paper and then gradually superimposed gestural brush strokes, color stains and delicate droplets of pigment onto the underlying drawings, welcoming the occurrence of accidents through this process. This not only made the contrast between emerging and disappearing forms integral to many of her paintings visible, but also conveyed a sense of the centrifugal motion that frequently ensues in them. As such, those who contemplate these first silkscreens by the artist may well find themselves questioning whether the alleged split between printmaking and painting is, in fact, purely theoretical.About the artistBorn in Budapest, Hungary, in 1968, Rita Ackermann currently lives and works in New York.Ackermann’s recent solo exhibitions include: ‘Hidden,’ MASI Lugano, Switzerland (2023); ‘Vertical Vanish,’ Hauser & Wirth Downtown Los Angeles (2023); ‘Mama ‘19,’ Hauser & Wirth New York, 22nd Street (2020); ‘Brother Sister,’ Hauser & Wirth Zurich, Switzerland (2019); ‘Movements as Monuments,’ La Triennale di Milano, Italy (2018); ‘Turning Air Blue,’ Hauser & Wirth Somerset, England (2017); ‘KLINE RAPE,’ Hauser & Wirth New York, 22nd Street (2016); ‘The Aesthetic of Disappearance,’ Malmö Konsthall, Malmo, Sweden (2016); ‘Chalkboard Paintings,’ Hauser & Wirth Zurich, Switzerland (2015); ‘MEDITATION ON VIOLENCE-HAIR WASH,’ Sammlung Friedrichshof, Burgenland, Austria and Sammlung Friedrichshof Stadtraum, Vienna, Austria (2014); ‘Negative Muscle,’ Hauser & Wirth New York, 69th Street (2013); ‘Fire by Days,’ Hauser & Wirth London, Piccadilly (2012); the Museum of Contemporary Art, Miami FL (2012); ‘Bakos,’ Ludwig Museum, Budapest, Hungary (2011); and ‘Rita Ackermann and Harmony Korine: ShadowFux,’ Swiss Institute, New York NY (2010).",Rita Ackermann.

Hauser,New York Chelsea,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/jennifer-rochlin-paintings-on-clay/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Jennifer Rochlin,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/jennifer-rochlin/,"Los Angeles-based painter Jennifer Rochlin embarked upon a shift toward three-dimensionality sixteen years ago when an unexpected teaching opportunity brought her into close contact with clay for the first time. Enchanted by its tactility and unpredictability, she discovered in the material a new channel for expression. Rochlin’s now-celebrated voluptuous clay vessels dominate the artist’s practice as canvases for her memories, idealized visions and the unfiltered biographical narratives she unspools over their undulating forms with palpable libidinal force. In her painted and glazed scenes, family, friends and partners are intertwined with trees and leaves that signify the passage of time through changing seasons. Wistfulness transitions seamlessly into humor or fades into unabashed adoration of nature’s enveloping beauty. Fluctuating between idealized depictions and unembellished honesty, Rochlin’s imagery conveys a tender and genuine sense of longing.Hauser & Wirth New York presents Rochlin’s most recent series of large-scale hand-built terra cotta vessels on which she offers up an autobiographical journey—intimate scenes of her life and loves, of nature observed and of her own responses to the greats of art history.Rochlin’s three-dimensional compositions coalesce largely without planning. While sketched in advance, the shapes of her vessels ultimately depart from classical form and symmetry through a laborious hand-building process that permits—indeed, encourages—distortion. Bodily, eccentric and imposing, the vessels’ commanding physicality prompts viewers to trace their curves and walk around them to follow the sequence of vignettes that travel their circumferences.Influenced by a background in experimental filmmaking, Rochlin’s paintings on clay have a distinct sense of movement and progression. She weaves together brief scenes with decorative patterns and natural elements, crafting cinematic montages in the round. ‘Trans-Siberian Railway’ (2023), for example, encapsulates a moment Rochlin captured on Super 8 film during her early travels along the Trans-Siberian Railroad in Russia. Steadying her camera on a man loitering by the tracks, she immortalized the instant he plucked purple irises from the ground and offered them to a woman leaning out of a passing train window. But in transferring this filmed story to a vessel, Rochlin has painted herself as the woman in the window, assuming the dual role of voyeur and protagonist. The train and its succession of windows ascend in a spiral reminiscent of a flickering film reel. Rochlin’s inclination toward romance is most evident here; always enlisting others, it serves as a driving force that propels her art forward.Rochlin likewise draws on her experiences in different parts of the world by incorporating tapestries and carpets encountered during her travels. Geometric patterns and decorative borders appear on such works as ‘Green Tapestry with Poppies and Bites’ (2024), in which rich green and chartreuse hues and delicate etched ornamentation travel along the wide curves of a bulbous form accented by three orange blossoms and three human bite marks.In 2018, Rochlin developed the unique method of biting into unfired clay and inviting others to participate in this form of mark making. The resulting imprints, often embellished with touches of purple and gold, resemble both bruises and blossoms. These bites, which appear on multiple vessels on view, indicate a chorus of willing collaborators and reflect Rochlin’s ongoing interest in seeking means to express erotic desire in gesture as well as image.This collaborative impulse continues in other works, too, such as ‘Honey Pot’ (2024), where more than twenty fellow female Los Angeles artists have intricately etched genitalia onto an imposing clay vessel, or in Rochlin’s loving visual quotations paying homage to Matisse and Giacometti. Whether through direct or indirect engagement, collaboration with other artists—both living and deceased—pervades her practice. Thus, Rochlin firmly asserts that she is not solitary in her pursuits but instead a member and beneficiary of a community formed across time.‘Jennifer Rochlin. Paintings on Clay’ will include small recent paintings by the artist, each corresponding to a specific vessel on view. Rochlin often makes such paintings of her pots, placing them in the landscape surrounding her house and studio to work plein air, rendering the very plants and colors that envelop the vessels’ surfaces. Since Rochlin does not create preparatory sketches for the figural narratives on her pots—she instead makes images spontaneously and intuitively in response to their forms—her vessels become veritable pages of a sketchbook, studies for paintings in a constant circuit of storytelling.About the artistJennifer Rochlin was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1968 and lives in Los Angeles, California. She received a Master of Fine Art from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1999, participated in an exchange at the Universität der Künste Berlin, Germany in 1998, and received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Colorado, Boulder in 1991. Rochlin is the recipient of the Individual Artist Grant from the Belle Foundation (2015) and the Durfee Foundation ARC grant (2007).

Challenging the hard-edged, manufactured aesthetic of the prevailing minimalist movement of her day, Hesse’s use of latex, Fiberglas and industrial plastics opened new possibilities in art. Half a century later, her groundbreaking oeuvre is as potent as it was in 1968, the year of the first and only exhibition of her sculptures held during her lifetime. That there have been some fifteen exhibitions in the decades following her death in 1970 is a testament to Hesse’s continued contemporaneity.Hauser & Wirth celebrates the 25th anniversary of the estate’s representation by the gallery by spotlighting Hesse’s remarkable achievements in ‘Eva Hesse. Five Sculptures.’ This exhibition, organized by Barry Rosen, longtime adviser to the Hesse estate, in collaboration with art historian and critic Briony Fer, reunites five of her most celebrated large-scale works, all on loan from major American museums and all made in the most intense period at the end of her life from 1967 to 1969. Installed on the ground floor of Hauser & Wirth’s gallery on West 22nd Street, the exhibition will emphasize the breadth, scope and impact of Hesse’s materially experimental and psychologically charged sculptures.In conjunction with the exhibition, Hauser & Wirth Publishers will release ‘Eva Hesse: Exhibitions, 1972–2022.’ Offering insight into Hesse’s milestone exhibitions from 1972 to the present day, this special volume addresses the ways in which exhibitions evolve from ideas to critical reception through the prism of Hesse’s work and her journey to becoming an icon of American art. Texts by the museum curators who made these shows reflect the personal dimension of crafting an exhibition, its intent and its reception. Edited by Barry Rosen and accompanied by extensive installation views, archival material, exhibition-related ephemera and snapshots, ‘Eva Hesse: Exhibitions, 1972–2022’ brings these exhibitions to life through the voices of Linda Shearer, Nicholas Serota, Ellen Johnson, Helen Cooper, Renate Petzinger, Elisabeth Sussman, Sabine Folie, Fred Wasserman, Catherine De Zegher, Fiona Bradley, Briony Fer, Luanne McKinnon, Petra Roettig, Brigitte Kölle, Andres Gyorody and Lena Stringari.About the exhibitionUnlike most of the abstract sculpture being produced at the time, Hesse’s works were abstract yet powerfully evocative of human corporality, laying bare the processes used to make them.‘The effect of a lot of Hesse’s large-scale sculpture is to put in question what you think you know about art.’ —Briony Fer.Seriality, connection and repetition were at the heart of Hesse’s creative process and are evidenced clearly in the earliest work on view in this exhibition, ‘Repetition Nineteen I’ (1967). On loan from The Museum of Modern Art, New York, this work is the first of three versions Hesse planned to make over a period of ten months. It is comprised of eighteen bucket-like forms, each a little over nine inches tall, and is the last piece Hesse made using papier-caché, a favored medium. Hesse originally planned a second version of ‘Repetition Nineteen’ in sheet metal coated with Sculp-Metal, but abandoned that idea when she began to work with rubber and latex. ‘Repetition Nineteen I’ is a key example from Hesse’s oeuvre, elucidating the artist’s emotionally suggestive use of form and space, and interest in objects that were visibly handmade and irregular.Although similar in size and shape, none of the cylindrical forms in ‘Repetition Nineteen I’ are exactly alike, creating a destabilizing and uncanny sense of doubling. Hesse kept their arrangement open-ended, insisting that they should not have a fixed order. The result is a responsive and provisional installation whose overall shape varies with each presentation. ‘I don’t ask that the piece be moved or changed, only that it could be moved and changed. There is not one preferred format,’ Hesse said.‘Area’ (1968), on loan from the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University in Columbus, was created in the summer of 1968 for Lucy Lippard’s landmark traveling exhibition ‘Soft and Apparently Soft Sculpture.’ For Hesse, ‘Area’ was important because of its underlying relationship to ‘Repetition Nineteen III.’ The artist explained: ‘‘Area’ is made from the mold of another piece, ‘Repetition Nineteen III.’ It is the insides that we took out. And then I made it into another piece. I mean there is no connection whatsoever except if you saw it, it is very clear… I rubberized the forms, attached them and sewed them together with wire and that is the piece… I have a personal attachment because it comes from another piece. I take a piece from one piece and make it totally another one. ‘Repetition Nineteen III’ was made of empty containers and there was that sexual connotation. It is anthropomorphic. ‘Area’ isn’t, or is in a totally different way. It is used as a flat piece with a suggestive three-dimensionality...’Both ‘Aught’ and ‘Augment,’ also made in 1968, will be installed just as they were for their public debut in that year’s now-legendary exhibition ‘9 at Leo Castelli.’ On loan from Glenstone Museum, ‘Augment’ comprises seventeen overlapping rectangular sheets of rubberized canvas (78 by 40 inches) placed on the floor. ‘Aught,’ borrowed from the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum, is comprised of four parts, each the same size as those in ‘Augment,’ hanging side-by-side along the wall. However, each of the four segments in ‘Aught’ are comprised of two sheets of rubberized canvas that have been attached at the edges and filled with polyethylene drop cloths, creating a slightly billowing effect on the surface, provoking viewers to feel the tension in the space––literal and psychological––between painting and sculpture.Finally, the monumental work ‘Expanded Expansion’ (1969), on loan from the Guggenheim Museum and made in the year before the artist’s death, embodies all her interests—especially her fascination with materiality, contradiction and absurdity. Hesse once described this piece as ‘opposite in form, large, looming, powerful yet precarious.’ Standing just over 10 feet tall and 30 feet wide when fully extended, ‘Expanded Expansion’ comprises thirteen panels made of fragile rubberized cheesecloth supported by rigid fiberglass and polyester resin poles. Its height is fixed by the length of the poles, but its width could originally be manipulated to expand or contract, so, like Repetition Nineteen I, its ultimate size is dependent on the qualities and limitations of its environment.",Eva Hesse.

In her drawings and paintings, there’s this sense of a dreamscape, a mosaic of her travels through the desert and from coast to coast.’Heilmann is known for working across mediums and for installations which playfully combine disparate works. Reflecting on the artist’s approach to exhibition-making, ‘Daydream Nation’ brings together works on paper, ranging from watercolor studies for larger paintings to works that function as paintings on paper in their own right, alongside a selection of her ceramic sculptures and sculptural chairs to create an ambiently whimsical yet conceptually rigorous environment. Heilmann often works in series, revisiting and reimagining certain arrangements of form and color over time, as evidenced here in such recurring motifs as the chair, rosebud, spiral, wave and web. But in Heilmann’s oeuvre, repetition begets difference and from this multiplicity emerges important truths about the functions of memory and our process of translating it.Drawing has always factored significantly into Heilmann’s practice, manifesting in a variety of forms in ‘Daydream Nation.’ The exhibition features a new mural-like installation that reimagines and expands an existing work into a new form of expression. Heilmann’s seventh wall drawing to date, this installation was developed in conversation with Simmons, who frequently explores the monumental scale of this medium in his own work.The title of this exhibition is taken from Sonic Youth’s groundbreaking album ‘Daydream Nation’ (1988), beloved by both Heilmann and Simmons. Evoking Heilmann’s longstanding interest in daydreaming as a creative exercise and the importance of travel for her in this process, it also situates her oeuvre within the culture of youthful rebellion in New York City, the California-born artist’s adopted home since 1968 and a constant source of energy and inspiration for her both personally and professionally.",Mary Heilmann.

Hauser,New York Chelsea,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/rita-ackermann-splits-printing-painting/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Rita Ackermann,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/rita-ackermann/,"Dr. Pamela Kort on Rita Ackermann’s exhibitions:SplitsTitled ‘Splits,’ Ackermann’s latest paintings mark a pinnacle in the artist’s ongoing concern with the creation of dynamic, moving images. In these canvases, forms cascade downward and upward, at times merging seamlessly into one another. To optimize the potential of such chance transformative processes, Ackermann conceptualized the canvas as divided into three screens, as she aptly calls them. This enabled her not only to guide the flow of line and paint, but also to forestall the coalescence of drawing and painting. No sketch prefigured the images that surfaced, except those carved into the recesses of her memory. Instead, Ackermann allowed an instinctive force to guide her hand as it moved across the fields before her.The fluctuation between the screens she populated with diaphanous lines and those carrying weightier, gestural strokes of color also conspired to infuse the paintings with an unexpected rhythm. In ‘Shut Eye’ (2023), for example, two screens brimming with fragments of drawn shapes entice the eye to actively pull open the middle register and thereby show more of the painted forms within. This occurs even as the upper and lower screens seem to press inward, creating a dynamic tension between revelation and concealment. To enhance this impression, Ackermann occasionally used luminous yellow pigment to further instill in these paintings a sense of lightness and transparency.Composed as a sequence of stacked-up semi-translucent frames, these canvases can also be seen as the visual equivalent of images imprinted on a film strip. Ackermann, in fact, draws parallels between the transformative essence of the images in the ‘Splits’ and the dynamic permutations observed when montaged photographic images are projected in a cinema. In both mediums, meaning opens in the infinitesimal split between what the eye sees and the elusive. There, a unique motion also unfolds, one that oscillates between appearance and truth. In all these paintings, there is mystery, one that hints at the presence of the profound and unknowable. Through their enigmatic allure, the ‘Splits’ encourage the viewer to ponder the ineffable, reminding us that while transcendence eludes sight, its essence can nonetheless reveal itself.Splits: Printing | PaintingIn the thick of bringing to canvas the metamorphic forms that would become the ‘Splits,’ Ackermann embarked on a new artistic endeavor, delving into the realm of printmaking. In the resultant seven large-scale silkscreens, which she produced in collaboration with master printer Keigo Takahashi, her concern with making manifest such images became imbued with a related objective: the transformation of paintings into prints, without recourse to the reproduction of a model. Though these silkscreens diverge from the compositional principles of the ‘Splits,’ like them they probe the boundaries of optical perception. To emphasize this, the exhibition includes two recent paintings. One of these—’The Rule of Nature’ (2023)—which belongs to the ‘Splits,’ even bears the marks of Ackermann’s concern with combining monotype printing with painting. Viewers who perceive that will nevertheless find it difficult to distinguish between the look of the other painting—’Misfit’ (2023)—and the silkscreens.This visual feat owes just as much to the artist’s decision to approach the making of these silkscreens as though she were working on a canvas, as to any sleight of the hand enabled by their production. Ackermann began by layering drawings onto paper and then gradually superimposed gestural brush strokes, color stains and delicate droplets of pigment onto the underlying drawings, welcoming the occurrence of accidents through this process. This not only made the contrast between emerging and disappearing forms integral to many of her paintings visible, but also conveyed a sense of the centrifugal motion that frequently ensues in them. As such, those who contemplate these first silkscreens by the artist may well find themselves questioning whether the alleged split between printmaking and painting is, in fact, purely theoretical.About the artistBorn in Budapest, Hungary, in 1968, Rita Ackermann currently lives and works in New York.Ackermann’s recent solo exhibitions include: ‘Hidden,’ MASI Lugano, Switzerland (2023); ‘Vertical Vanish,’ Hauser & Wirth Downtown Los Angeles (2023); ‘Mama ‘19,’ Hauser & Wirth New York, 22nd Street (2020); ‘Brother Sister,’ Hauser & Wirth Zurich, Switzerland (2019); ‘Movements as Monuments,’ La Triennale di Milano, Italy (2018); ‘Turning Air Blue,’ Hauser & Wirth Somerset, England (2017); ‘KLINE RAPE,’ Hauser & Wirth New York, 22nd Street (2016); ‘The Aesthetic of Disappearance,’ Malmö Konsthall, Malmo, Sweden (2016); ‘Chalkboard Paintings,’ Hauser & Wirth Zurich, Switzerland (2015); ‘MEDITATION ON VIOLENCE-HAIR WASH,’ Sammlung Friedrichshof, Burgenland, Austria and Sammlung Friedrichshof Stadtraum, Vienna, Austria (2014); ‘Negative Muscle,’ Hauser & Wirth New York, 69th Street (2013); ‘Fire by Days,’ Hauser & Wirth London, Piccadilly (2012); the Museum of Contemporary Art, Miami FL (2012); ‘Bakos,’ Ludwig Museum, Budapest, Hungary (2011); and ‘Rita Ackermann and Harmony Korine: ShadowFux,’ Swiss Institute, New York NY (2010).",Rita Ackermann.

The works in this series are set at dusk, twilight, and deep night—hours that become vehicles for ritual and interiority. The silhouetted inhabitants of this in-between realm are archetypes that Brackens once described as ciphers, or “needles through which I slip the threads of biography and myth, and pass through a mesh of history and context.”His figures are accompanied by an ecosystem of symbols and shapes that have recurred over the course of his practice. The animals, natural elements, and man-made objects, accrue significance every time they are cast in this ever-evolving mythology. The characters in this series are placed in dialogue with lightning bolts, waning suns, and sourceless orbs of light—open-ended devices of orientation. In these distilled arrangements, footholds for straightforward interpretation dissolve—inviting viewers to parse the compositions and uncover meaning.Brackens’ semiotic language emerges from lived experience, but also through revisiting books, poems, and legends. In blood compass, some of these references—alluded to in his titles— include the novel Mind of My Mind by Octavia Butler, the poem “How you might approach a foal” by Wendy Videlock, and the Bible’s parable of the prodigal son. These stories, though dramatically diverse in genre and subject, speak to Brackens’ inclination to loop, lose, and locate one’s self in that which is known, but also to shape-shift, forming new meaning from that which is “familiar.” He approaches these symbols—weighted with memory, context, and history—with fresh eyes or, as Videlock’s poem concludes, ”like you / are new to the world.”Diedrick Brackens (b. 1989, Mexia, TX; lives and works in Los Angeles, CA) is best known for his woven tapestries that explore allegory and narrative through the artist’s autobiography, broader themes of African American and queer identity, as well as American history. Brackens employs techniques from West African weaving, quilting from the American South and European tapestry-making to create both abstract and figurative works. Often depicting moments of male tenderness, Brackens culls from African and African American literature, poetry and folklore as source. Beginning his process through the hand-dyeing of cotton, a material he deliberately uses in acknowledgement of its brutal history, Brackens’ oeuvre presents rich, nuanced visions of African American life and identity, while also alluding to the complicated histories of labor and migration. Brackens utilizes both commercial dyes and atypical pigments such as wine, tea and bleach to create his vibrant, intricately-woven tapestries that investigate historical gaps, interlacing the present with his singular magical realist worldview. Brackens’ scenes intentionally lack any sort of moralizing tone, allowing his subjects the freedom of living life on their terms.

New drawings referencing influential poets will be on view, complemented by a selection of sculptures, the forms of which are comprised of characters from various alphabets, highlighting language and poetry as recurring sources of inspiration in the artist’s practice.Plensa’s works on paper often combine mixed media and collage, imbuing the works with a sculptural quality. In large scale drawings, Plensa geometrically arranges clippings of poems by masters of the genre—among them T.S. Eliot and Charles Baudelaire—merging the literary and visual arts. These collages are accented by shadowing and reliefs of abstracted portraiture, bringing depth to the two-dimensional forms. The artist has likened his approach to drawing and collage to the human body, bringing many individual elements together to form a more important whole. Plensa’s practice is guided by a desire to create unity through connections of the body and collective memory, and with these drawings offers an expression of a reflective inner world.In the small gallery space, a series of drawings that reference Shakespeare’s Macbeth will be on view. The story has long fascinated Plensa, who in 2023 contributed stage direction, costumes, and set design to a new staging of Giuseppe Verdi’s Macbeth at the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, Spain. In this new collection of drawings, Plensa considers the theme of sleeplessness in Shakespeare’s play, crafting dark and difficult to discern works that invoke the ominous paranoia of the story’s protagonist. In SLEEP NO MORE (2023), Plensa pairs imagery of wire busts, a common form in his sculptural practice, with text of the iconic phrase for which the work is titled. The heads appear back-to-back, seemingly morphing into one, while shadows obscure Shakespeare’s words to varying degrees, rendering some nearly illegible. Here, Plensa’s exploration of what the viewer sees—or does not see—recalls the role of Birnam Wood in Macbeth and the illusion of the advancing forest.The large-scale sculpture UTOPIA (2024), is on view, marking the debut of an entirely new sculptural form in the artist’s practice. Rendered in Cor-Ten steel, the sculpture reads “utopia,” the state of being from which it derives its title. With each letter composed of an amalgamation of characters from various alphabets, this work celebrates the diversity in our shared humanity and envisions a more beautiful world characterized by this unity. While Plensa has often incorporated language in his sculptures, UTOPIA is the first sculpture to do so in a horizontal means; this is also the artist’s first alphabet-based work to be rendered in Cor-Ten steel. With this work, Plensa demonstrates the continued innovation of his sculptural practice and his ongoing commitment to discovering the perfect material and technology for each individual work.",Jaume Plensa: Silent Diary,"528 West 26th Street, NY 10001",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 9 May  - 29 Jun 2024

Francis was a fixture in the 1970s downtown New York art scene, where her close circle consisted of artists Dan Christensen, Larry Poons, and Larry Zox, amongst other well-known second-generation Abstract Expressionists. Leading galleries including Andre Emmerich and Tibor de Nagy represented her during this period, and she was included in the 1973 edition of the Whitney Biennial. Art critic Peter Schjeldahl in 1973 positively reviewed her body of work, commenting in the New York Times that her “colors run to luxurious brown‐golds, dreamy blue greens and dusty pinks, though each canvas is alive with a variety of evanescent hues and tints.”Helen Frankenthaler and Clement Greenberg both owned paintings executed by Francis. Although she has previously been omitted from art history books on abstract expressionism and color field painting, this exhibition sets the stage for rediscovery in 2024, displaying 12 works that have not been shown in 50 years.Lincoln Glenn Gallery believes Sherron Francis deserves to be restored to her own context in art history.

Sugimoto not only follows in the footsteps of Isaac Newton, who published his work Opticks: or, A Treatise of the Reflexions, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light in 1704, but also realigns his practice from a photographer of black- and-white fields, forms and figures, towards a scientific surveyor of blazing color and invisible possibility.“These are the first color photographs I have made. With the help of my prism, I created rainbows in the room and shot them every morning. I entered into this zone of light and shadow, while recreating the feeling of shock and surprise that Newton must have felt. This light had no shape or form. In a certain sense, it was pure. These were gradations of light that emerged out of the darkness and began to shift. Nothing is in focus, so there is this feeling of ecstasy or rapture.”Beginning with a series of Polaroids after being gifted the last Japanese batch of the film in 2009, Sugimoto isolated sections of visible, spectral light using a prism set up at home, often focusing on the edges where these glowing patches emerged or returned to darkness. For the first time, Sugimoto will present this prism apparatus in the space of this show, positioned to capture the light from the gallery's skylight at certain moments throughout the day. He also further split the beam of light using a mirror that he could rotate, in order to expand each color into further variations of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, even introducing second, third or more colors into a single image. After contemplating and finessing his studies for a decade, Sugimoto only began to scan and enlarge the Opticks to make unique C-prints in 2018.“Why must science always cut up the whole into little pieces when it identifies specific attributes? The world is filled with countless colors, so why did natural science insist on just seven? I seem to get a truer sense of the world from those disregarded intracolors. Does not art serve to retrieve what falls through the cracks, now that scientific knowledge no longer needs a God?”The show’s title, ‘Optical Allusion,’ relates to the idea that photography is ultimately a subjective version of the truth, given that every individual perceives color differently, whether physiologically or culturally. It also ‘alludes’ to the similarities between the scale, ambition and immersion of these photographic works with those of pioneering modernist abstractionists and contemporary color field painters. Ultimately, Sugimoto is depicting not only emotional states of mind but also intangible, otherworldly spectacles – abstract effects which he claims could even be achieved on another planet, independent of our earthly atmosphere, materials or landscapes.“All my life I have made a habit of never believing my eyes – there has never been any guarantee that what I see is actually there.”A room dedicated to the Opticks series forms the culmination of Sugimoto’s major retrospective exhibition, ‘Time Machine’, which was first staged at Hayward Gallery, London (October 11, 2023 – Jan 7, 2024) and has now toured to UCCA Beijing (until June 23, 2024).",Hiroshi Sugimoto: Optical Allusion,"504 West 24th Street, NY 10011",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 2 May  - 2 Aug 2024

William Eric Brown’sworks — the source images for which were taken in Antarctica in the 1960s by the artist’s father while serving in the US Navy and stationed on an icebreaker — are instilled with new significance through his manipulation and reconceptualization, which address the current reality of climate change and its effects on the arctic. Sophia Chai explores her memory of learning the Korean alphabet as a child through her work. By drawing and painting the shapes and lines of the characters on the walls and floor of her studio, Chai reimagines them in space, thereby abstracting written communication into an embodiment of the sensation of each word being formed inside the mouth.Sheida Soleimani stages elaborately constructed tableaux to address interwoven narratives of family, politics, and caregiving that trace both personal and public histories. Her carefully fabricated scenes demonstrate her commitment to approaching her practice with measured sensitivity; rather than divorcing her subjects from their own realities, Soleimani creates a contemplative space in which each incorporated object or image conveys an intentional message. Similarly, Shaun Pierson’s work illuminates the complex dynamics in the relationship between photographer and subject. Entwining conflicting sensations of inhibition and desire, Pierson lays bare the often simultaneously transactional and vulnerable apparatus and process of making photographs. Kevin Landers’ photographs, taken on the streets of New York, are rooted firmly in the here and now. He documents a collection of seemingly unnoticed moments, paying careful attention to unexpected details that, more often than not, most people would simply walk past — ephemera such as an abandoned shopping cart or an intricately woven spider web.Queer desire and a longing for another space and time are explored through the re-authoring of found or archival images in the works of Gonzalo Reyes Rodriguez and Brittany Nelson. Rodriguez pairs images from his own history with a series of photographs he purchased from a bookshop in Mexico City — dated between 1987 and 1993, the found snapshots evidence the personal experiences of a young, presumably queer, man known to us as “Technoir.” By combining the two archives, Rodriguez invites us to dwell in a space of merged memories, neither of which we can fully inhabit, and of the desire to know more. While at first glance Brittany Nelson’s use of archival materials is less overtly personal, her work considers themes of otherness, isolation, and the desire for connection. In one of the series on view, she perceived a sense of romantic devastation in the images taken by Opportunity, the Mars rover, which she amplifies by re-printing them using the 1920s analog bromoil photographic process, thereby infusing them with an added eerie, otherworldly quality.Though varied in their approaches to photographic practice, what unifies these artists is their investigation of longing, care, and lineage—familial and otherwise—and the way in which they use the medium and the process of making the work as a means to engage with others, with themselves, and to challenge expectations. Generating a constellated conversation that draws upon photography’s history, yet turns toward something altogether new, the artists included in Tiptoeing Through the Kitchen, Recent Photography imbue the seemingly unknown with flashes of recognition.","Tiptoeing Through the Kitchen, Recent Photography","531 West 24th Street, NY 10011",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 26 Apr  - 8 Jun 2024

Each of the works presented is articulated through oil on canvas. In recent years, however, Eder’s subject matter – in particular, his depictions of female nudes as a male painter in 2024—has been subject to controversy. Beyond the dialogue raised by his depiction of the nude, Eder’s work presents an absurd series of themes portrayed through a disarming aura of kitsch: cats (both demonic and allegorical), toy poodles, and male nudes, for example. The subjects often inhabit landscapes that oscillate between late-capitalist nightmares and antiquity.In these paintings, one finds countless references to academic painters of bygone centuries whose proclivities and desires have been effaced by museums, high auction prices, and countless scholars. And while one could easily begin to unravel the desires of the painter, it is important to note that these works also serve, and are activated by the viewer’s own desires. Ultimately, DETOX is comprised of the panoply of images commonly found on the Internet today, functioning more as a mirror than a depiction.

Not only have these artists' works endured, but they are now recognized as significant within both the history of commercial art galleries and broader Art History.With DETOX, perhaps we are then left to contemplate: why should a gallery host an exhibition whose sole purpose is to challenge taste?

Freud’s approach to printmaking was informed by his painting; by placing the etching plate upright on an easel, he was able to meticulously work from life. Always working directly from his models and demarcating their forms through meticulous networks of finely etched lines. Unsettling and unyielding, these portraits contain a remarkable honesty and an awkwardness that adds to the psychological tension.Francis Bacon’s graphic works reflect his relentless strive to “open the valves of feeling.” He acted as a self-proclaimed witness of mankind, setting himself the task of scrutinizing the human condition. Whether self-portraits, depictions of former lovers, or evocations of the human figure, each produces the same expressive and fiercely charged effect seen in his paintings. He worked closely with his printmakers to capture the same color quality, especially evident in the bright oranges and deep blacks.Bacon and Freud shared an impassioned, yet tumultuous, nearly forty-year friendship. When the pair met in the mid-1940s through their mutual friend Graham Sutherland, they quickly struck up a friendship and became inseparable, often seeing each other daily. The two would frequently partake in debaucherous activities, spending time at the Gargoyle Club (and later the Colony Room) gambling, drinking, and fraternizing with fellow bohemians, which on one occasion, lead Freud to competitively gamble away everything he owned, including his car.Their friendship was also fueled by their mutual interest in their own and each other’s art practice. Freud deeply admired Bacon’s work and was struck with the distinct emotive qualities and rawness of the human form. When Freud sat for Bacon in 1951, he was moved by the artist’s spontaneous, hurried approach to artmaking. Conversely, when Freud drew Bacon the following year, Bacon was astonished by the level of detail and time Freud invested in the piece.In the studio, the two shared a complex relationship, with Bacon and Freud fiercely critiquing, whilst inspiring, one another’s work. While Bacon encouraged Freud to break away from traditional modes of portraiture, Freud motivated Bacon to tap into his subject’s psyche and explore the emotional depths of his sitters. As Freud recounted, “I realized immediately that [Bacon’s] work related to how he felt about life. Mine on the other hand seemed very labored. That was because there was a terrific amount of labor for me to do anything—and still is.

Much of Barthé’s oeuvre reflects his penchant for allegory and an embrace of classical realism that rendered him a stylistic outlier of his generation. He consistently sought to convey a universal sense of heroism reflective of the African diaspora through his sculpture, producing a refined body of bust-length portraits and full-length figures portraying a variety of individuals, including historical luminaries, archetypal, religious, and mythological subjects, and contemporary celebrities from the dance and theater worlds. While the Black male figure was a prevailing focus of Barthé’s practice, a consideration of his larger oeuvre reveals a career-long investment in depicting subjects of both genders with authority and empathy. Often working from memory, Barthé used his superior technical ability to imbue his sculptures with a sense of movement and emotional interiority, affectingly capturing the spiritual essence of his subjects. A New Day Is Coming features several of the artist’s most celebrated sculptures, such as Feral Benga (1935), which portrays Parisian cabaret dancer François “Feral” Benga; Julius (c.1940), a portrait of Julius Perkins, Jr., a child actor and musician active in Harlem; Stevedore (1937) a heroic representation of the working everyman; Black Madonna (1961), an iconographic interpretation of the Holy Mother as a Black woman; and The Negro Looks Ahead (1944), a symbolic rendition of Black fortitude.Though Barthé was never open about his sexuality, his frequent portrayals of the male nude were recognized as expressions of homoerotic desire by his friends and peers in the art and literary world. During his years in New York (1929–1948), Barthé became a key figure in an elite milieu of creatives and intellectuals who discretely incorporated gay themes into their work, including poets Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, and Countee Cullen, cabaret performer Jimmie Daniels, play-wright Harold Jackman, and photographer Carl Van Vechten. Barthé formed particularly important friendships with the poet Richard Bruce Nugent and Harlem Renaissance philosopher Alain Locke, the latter of whom considered Barthé’s sculpture a consummate embodiment of the New Negro Movement’s mandate to uplift the collective consciousness of Black America.Both Locke and Nugent are important figures in Isaac Julien’s filmography. His breakthrough film Looking for Langston (1989) is a lyrical montage of real and imagined sequences exploring the lives and work of Harlem’s gay cultural luminaries of the 1920s and their descendants in the 1980s; the film features excerpts from Nugent’s short story “Smoke, Lilies, and Jade” (1926) as well as archival footage of Locke and Barthé. Once Again . . . (Statues Never Die) is, in many ways, a sequel to Looking for Langston, taking up many of the same themes and subjects. Structured around a conversation between Locke and Albert C. Barnes, an important collector of African sculpture and founder of the Barnes Foundation, the film poetically weaves a thematic exploration of Black queer desire into its timely meditation on the collection and display of African material culture in European and American institutions. Locke and Barthé’s relationship is a primary touchpoint in the film’s arc, and Barthé’s sculptures figure prominently in the film.A New Day Is Coming features several casts from editions Barthé produced in the 1940s through the 1960s, as well as standout examples of his unique painted plaster sculptures dating from 1935 through 1966. The exhibition also includes several editions cast in the final decade of Barthé’s life drawn from the collection of art historian, curator, artist, and Barthé scholar Samella Lewis (1923–2022), who was close friends with the sculptor. In 1985–86, Dr. Lewis assisted Barthé in casting new editions of many of his most accomplished sculptures—a project funded by another important friend and patron, the actor James Garner. Reproductions of archival photographs commemorating highlights of Barthé’s life and career are installed throughout the gallery, providing a historical backdrop to the presentation. These photos complement two large-scale Inkjet prints by Julien capturing a moment in Once Again... Statues Never Die in which the film’s characters contemplate Barthé’s Black Madonna (1961).Richmond Barthé: A New Day Is Coming is mounted in conversation with multiple recent and ongoing museum exhibitions. In 2022, the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia opened Isaac Julien: Once Again . . . (Statues Never Die), an immersive, five-screen installation by Julien commissioned by the Foundation on the occasion of their centennial. Installed among the screens were three of the Barthé sculptures featured in the film, eight works of African art from the Foundation’s collection, and a selection of works by contemporary sculptor Matthew Angelo Harrison. In 2023, the Tate Britain opened the traveling career retrospective Isaac Julien: What Freedom is to me, which featured seven of the artist’s major film installations, including Once Again . . . (Statues Never Die); the exhibition is currently on view at its final venue, the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht, The Netherlands, through August 17, 2024.Once Again . . . (Statues Never Die) is also featured in the 2024 Whitney Biennial, Even Better Than the Real Thing, open through August 11, 2024. Among the Barthé sculptures augmenting this iteration of the work is a cast of Barthé’s Stevedore (1937) on loan from Michael Rosenfeld Gallery. The installation also features two Barthé sculptures owned by the Whitney, African Dancer (1933)—which was included in the museum’s First Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary American Sculpture, Watercolors, and Prints in 1933—and The Blackberry Woman (1932). Notably, when the museum acquired The Blackberry Woman in 1932, Barthé became the first Black artist to enter their collection. Finally, two of Barthé’s most renowned sculptures, The Boxer (1942) and Feral Benga (1935–36), are currently on view in The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s much-anticipated historical survey The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism, open through July 28, 2024.Richmond Barthé: A New Day Is Coming is Michael Rosenfeld Gallery’s first solo exhibition on the artist, who has been an important presence in the gallery’s program for nearly thirty-five years.",Richmond Barthé: A New Day Is Coming,"100 11th Avenue, NY 10011",Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, 6 Apr  - 26 Jul 2024

This characteristic can be seen in the work of historical artists, who are considered references or inspiration for the artist, such as Pablo Picasso and Tarsila do Amaral. In VOLUMENS, his works of vivid colors, malleable, and ambiguous forms resemble body parts, organs, biomorphic forms, and sculptural abstractions.Over the last year, the artist conceived the works presented in the show through the connections they establish with each other. Although volumetry is widely used in the paintings, the shapes that compose the elements represented have a certain malleability, as if they were metamorphosing. Thus, the paintings share similarities, whether thematic or formal, which shown together, highlight the artist's poetic journey and the developments of his pictorial investigations.In Parigi's words: “I draw and paint figures aiming to transfigure bodies and pre-established ideas, confusion of genres and the exploration of boundaries between real or simulated images. Bodies are fused and remodeled to transform the canvas or paper surfaces, where containments and expansions are negotiated within the physical limits of the support.”The exhibition includes references to artists and movements in art history, especially Surrealism, which celebrates its centenary this year. The ambiguity of the forms and their exuberant coloring give the compositions a dreamlike and absurd aspect, which is close to the proposals of the artistic avant-garde. Parigi points out that the development of the works was a kind of dive into his own subconscious: ""My work emerges from the conflict between reality and fiction. Through drawings, paintings, and performances I explore a universe of self-imagined fiction, inhabited by hybrid or androgynous figures of strange beauty, forms that inhabit the surface like living bodies that could even breathe or move.""",Rodolpho Parigi: VOLUMENS,"511 W 21st Street, NY 10011",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 2 May  - 8 Jun 2024

Cultivating her own radical sensibility in early experiments, she alluded to the virtuosity of Brassaï, Roy DeCarava, Diane Arbus, and Robert Frank. These artists set a tempo upon which Smith developed her own dexterity in portraiture, landscape, and street photography—highly attuned to the textures, geometries, and thrums pulsing through every spectrum of life. She recognized the haunting allure of an oil-slicked roadside and the liquid lightning of brass instruments in musicians’ animated hands.Smith listens through her camera, sensitive to the harmony and dissonance that enliven her subjects and surroundings. At times, it is easy to forget that she works in a static medium, since each photograph transports its viewer into the energetic nucleus of the moment she captures. Through paint application, double exposure, and low shutter speed, Smith pushes photography’s form to the point of its brim and break. Like harnessing a memory, Smith underlines the evanescent—at once vivid and obscure.About Ming SmithMing Smith (b. 1947, Detroit, Michigan) is an artist living and working in Harlem, New York. She became a photographer when she was given a camera at a young age. She was the first female member to join Kamoinge, a collective of Black photographers in New York in the 1960s who documented Black life. In 2023, MoMA presented Projects: Ming Smith, a survey of the artist’s photography from the 1970s through her most recent work. Smith was included in Going Dark: The Contemporary Figure at the Edge of Visibility at the Guggenheim Museum, and Soul of a Nation at Tate Modern in collaboration with Brooklyn Museum, Crystal Bridges and The Broad. She was also featured in Brooklyn Museum’s We Wanted A Revolution: Black Radical Women, 1965-85. Her work was exhibited in conjunction with Arthur Jafa’s A Series of Utterly Improbable, Yet Extraordinary Renditions at Serpentine Galleries, London; Julia Stoschek Collection, Berlin; Galerie Rudolfinum, Prague and Moderna Museet, Stockholm. Smith’s work is in the collections of MoMA, the Whitney Museum of Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Detroit Institute of Arts, Virginia Museum of Fine Art, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, and the National Museum of African-American History and Culture.

"Petzel, 520 W 25th St",New York Chelsea,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/stefanie-heinze-mortar-the-cute-ones-shouldnt-go-unnoticed/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Stefanie Heinze,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/stefanie-heinze/,"Heinze considers mortar as a site of genesis, the container of beginnings, from which raw materials are processed. Mortar can be the sound of aggression, bombardment, a foil or a threat. Mortar and pestle, a receptable for grinding ingredients, a cup for holding and crushing hard, like the grinding of teeth, or the moment infatuation becomes obsession, when yearning turns from tender to brutal. The paste which binds building blocks together, holding and distributing weight, sometimes decorative, composed of cement, water and sand. Paint is mortar, the built environment is mortar, the grind is mortar, decisions are sealed in mortar, and so is the longing for something even better and bigger and harder.Heinze starts with small-scale drawings and collages, which are translated to large-scale tracings, undergoing several transformations as her canvases take shape. Rendering her surfaces over several months, layers of line and color are suspended in scenes at once frozen and in motion. Heinze works with a sense of suspicion, disputing the power of images. Her depictions are at times plush, like her floating, -bodied cherubs, or sharp and dense, like her reckless, airborne cinder blocks. Heinze’s pictures lend expanded, fragmented associations to her subjects, both stony and swaddled, heavy and buoyant. Heinze’s works negotiate categorization, neither pure figuration nor abstraction. Language hits a limit here, reaching for the means to describe–an enzyme, a digestif–where words fail. Heinze strives for a more empirical vocabulary, generating fields of sensation.Interested in divination practices, ranging from tarot reading to online “spiritualist” influencing, the artist creates images motivated by imagined futures, drawing on both medieval and New Age “Youtubian” utopias. Influenced by the theory of the third hand in painting, the experience of transcendence which overtakes the artist at that critical point of flow state absorption, Heinze’s leans into this tradition of mysticism. Heinze allows the pieces to reveal themselves over time, creating kinetic, shifting pictures that trip expectation. Heinze builds tender worlds, in which instinct and environment coalesce in new impossibilities.About Stefanie HeinzeStefanie Heinze’s (b. 1987, Berlin, Germany) paintings display ambiguous forms that become recognizable as unexpected subjects. From disembodied body parts, to everyday objects, to animal-like figures, her subjects melt into fantastical backgrounds to create vivid visual worlds, which reveal an interplay between high and low culture.Heinze’s brightly colored, imaginative compositions are tenderly subversive in their details and symbolism, complemented with equally lyrical titles. Pencil, ink, or ballpoint pen drawings – sometimes torn and collaged into multi-layered compositions – form a basis for Stefanie Heinze’s artistic practice, mapping for the opulent language of her paintings. Testing the fine line between abstraction and figuration, Heinze is categorically unique, as she explores new senses and possibilities of representation.In the short time since studying at Academy of Fine Arts, Oslo (2012) and graduating from the Academy of Fine Arts in Leipzig (2016), Heinze has exhibited widely. She has had solo exhibitions at Capitain Petzel, Berlin (2022); Petzel, New York (2020); Capitain Petzel, Berlin (2019); LC Queisser, Tbilisi (2019); among others. She has participated in numerous group shows including at Le Consortium, Dijon, (2023); The Hepworth Wakefield, West Yorkshire (2022-23); Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami (2022); Boros Foundation at Berghain, Berlin (2020) Deichtorhallen, Hamburg (2020); Sammlung Philara, Düsseldorf (2019); Saatchi Gallery, London (2018); and Tanya Leighton, Berlin (2017).Heinze has a forthcoming exhibition at the Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in 2024 that will be accompanied by an extensive exhibition catalogue.Heinze’s works are in the collections of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Musée d‘Art Moderne de Paris; MAMCO, Geneva; Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden; Pérez Art Museum, Miami; The Hepworth Wakefield, UK; Marguerite Hoffman Collection, Dallas; The Rachofsky Collection, Dallas; Mead Gallery at Warwick Arts Centre, UK; the Delfina Collection, UK; and the Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in Turin.",Stefanie Heinze: MORTAR (the cute ones shouldn’t go unnoticed),"520 W 25th Street, NY 10001",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 3 May  - 8 Jun 2024

The so-called “worst seat in the house,” the artist challenges the equation of nosebleed-tier distance with disadvantage, creating a space at once above and among the action.Encountering the installation, the viewer is confronted by the nosebleed vantage point of a stadium beneath their feet, the panoramic image blanketing the gallery floor. Reproduced on vinyl, figures with arms raised foreground a blurred sea of bodies, cresting fields of light and shadow. Mounted at an angle, a mirrored surface reflects the warped image onto the audience. The spectator floats above, stepping about and around various photographic works and sculptures, while a single spotlight illuminates the space. Gale encloses the audience in a distorted arena, in which the structural and atmospheric aspects of the stadium are superimposed under, above, and back onto the observer.Gale’s walls are left completely bare, redirecting the viewer’s gaze downward. Arranged atop the vinyl floor, the artist presents four deconstructed architectural models of stadiums. Using composite 3-d printed models, broken apart by hand and reconfigured in different orientations, the sculptures draw on both existing and unrealized projects. Two failed architectural plans, the Deutsches Stadion designed by Albert Speer and the Theatre of the Masses designed by Gaetano Ciocca, are cited. Real elements are composed from Madison Square Garden and Manchester Arena, both in-operation large-scale entertainment complexes.In addition to the models, Gale presents various mixed media and photographic works placed atop the vinyl floor. The artist debuts a new series of velvet on aluminum works, evocative of stage curtains, positing the space in a lexicon of theater. A new series of photographic images are similarly arranged on the ground. Comprised of both camera-less and camera-produced images, Gale’s subjects vary: an ear, an open mouth, a packed stadium, an empty grave, a copper mine, a tunnel from a Carrara marble quarry. Bearing roads, folds, seats, and teeth, Gale’s images spiral, sink into the floor. The viewer might find a mouth open to sing, or scream, at a concert. The copper mine might resemble a stadium, where the labor of performers is likewise extracted. The audience might look down at a body in a stadium, but also from the edge of a grave.Through NOSEBLEED, Gale presents an uneasy social arena, refracting the spectacle of performance and visibility onto the audience. Privileging the nosebleed perspective, wrought with culturally stratified ways of seeing and being seen, the artist considers the stadium as both a site of heightened connection and amplified vulnerability. How are anxieties and desires expressed through collective ritual, among others in crowded amphitheaters, among ourselves in our own bodies?About Nikita GaleNikita Gale (b. 1983 Anchorage, Alaska) is an artist living and working in Los Angeles, California and holds a BA in Anthropology with an emphasis in Archaeological Studies from Yale University and earned an MFA in New Genres at UCLA.Gale’s work explores the relationship between materials, power, and attention. A key tenet of the artist’s practice is that the structures that shape attention determine who or what is seen, heard, recorded, remembered, and believed.Gale’s practice examines the ways in which silence, noise, and visibility function as political positions and conditions. Gale’s broad-ranging installations – often comprising concrete, barricades, video and automated sound and lighting – blur formal and disciplinary boundaries, engaging with concerns of mediation and automation in contemporary performance. By approaching reproduction as a mechanism that connects humans to a desire for extension and amplification through both biological and industrial processes, the artist’s work points to the ways that technology not only functions as an extension and amplification of the body but also as a means by which labor and violence are displaced and concentrated.The artist’s work has recently been exhibited at Tate Modern (London), Chisenhale (London); LAXART (Los Angeles); 52 Walker (New York); MoMA PS1 (New York); Kunstraum Kreuzberg (Berlin); Swiss Institute (New York); California African American Museum (Los Angeles); The Studio Museum in Harlem (New York); and in “Whitney Biennial 2024: Even Better Than the Real Thing” at the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York) and “Made in L.A. 2018” at the Hammer Museum (Los Angeles).The artist’s work is included in the collections at the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, California; Hessel Museum of Art, Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts; Pérez Art Museum, Museum Miami (PAMM), Miami, Florida; The Studio Museum, Harlem, New York; and Tate Modern, London, United Kingdom.",Nikita Gale: NOSEBLEED,"520 W 25th Street, NY 10001",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 2 May  - 8 Jun 2024

McCloud’s abstract stamped paintings combine unconventional industrial materials such as aluminum sheeting, silver aluminum butane paint, and black liquid tar on tar paper with traditional pigments and woodblock printing techniques. Transitioning from the elaborate ornamentation of previous works in this series, McCloud has simplified the design to a single, minimal repeating shape. Streamlining this process has allowed for a repetitive, though more nuanced, intuitive approach. This change reflects a newfound confidence in his artistic vision, prompting him to question the necessity of each element within the composition. McCloud also embraces a more vibrant palette inspired by his time in Mexico.As McCloud revisits his Burdened Man series, he finds himself more personally connected to the imagery, seeing his reflection in carrying the burden of life’s experiences within the works. Despite the meticulous and exacting creative process – using hundreds, even thousands, of small cut-out pieces of single use plastic to “paint” the compositions – these new figurative works incorporate abstract elements, embracing a sense of freedom in his approach to representational imagery. McCloud's flower series, on view in the front gallery, were initially begun as a daily meditative practice during the pandemic to document the passage of time. The works are constructed of single-use plastic with oil paint to accentuate the blossoms. There are also watercolors on the wax paper McCloud uses in the fabrication of his plastic paintings.As with all of McCloud’s oeuvre, material regeneration is a prevalent connection within his work. His ability to elevate industrial elements into fine art materials is consistent throughout the exhibition, serving as a linear narrative that underscores his dedication to pushing boundaries and exploring the breadth of his creativity.Hugo McCloud lives and works in Los Angeles. His work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut, The Arts Club, London, and Fondazione 107, in Turin, Italy. He has also been featured in group exhibitions at the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art, Virginia, the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, and The Drawing Center, New York.

The fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and his discovery of the West led him to choose a career as an artist. He has since built an exuberant and engaged art practice on what was both a historical and personal upheaval.The series of oils on canvas with their shimmering colours, almost unbearably vivid, are rooted in the socialist realism of his childhood as well as the codes of contemporary hedonism. Ludology is based on the work of Dutch historian and cultural theorist Johan Huizinga, who contrasts Homo Faber, rational and focused on progress, with Homo Ludens, a being governed by the characteristics of play. Ludology is Bisky’s interpretation of play philosophy, lifting the curtain on the ambiguity of a society obsessed with perfection and idleness.Each painting can be understood in two different ways: is the troop of boys in protective overalls the sign of coming catastrophe or a nod to a fetishist performance? Is the clown who keeps tight hold of a bouquet of balloons going to a birthday party or playing the main part in a horror film? Does the plane wreck testify to a war zone or is it part of the decor at a desert rave party?At the heart of the gallery, several large pieces of a puzzle made of plywood and painted on both sides are arranged as an installation symbolising this double-edged narrative. What Bisky does here, including with the style and pictorial codes of the work, is to link the radical subjectivity of expressionism to the idealised realism of propaganda art and the glossy aesthetics of advertising. He also draws an explicit link between the urban world and lush tropical nature, pornography and political activism. “More and more in my work I play with signs and symbols, which have become key elements of my art over the last decade,” he explains. “I create a dialogue between them and arrange them in my new collages so they represent an ambivalent vision of the world around us, permanently swinging between utopia and disenchantment.”Norbert Bisky was born in 1970 in Leipzig, Germany. His treatment of landscapes and exploration of the portrait and narrative structure place him firmly in the tradition of great European painting. But Norbert Bisky's experiments with breaking down forms and with blocks of colour also place him on the borderline of abstract art. His figurative style of painting, conjuring up the socialist realism he experienced as a child in GDR, suggests both hedonism and chaos in its contemporary form.",Norbert Bisky: LUDOLOGY,"293 Tenth Avenue, NY 10001",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 2 May  - 22 Jun 2024

Kang’s practice centers on the exploration of tension, boundaries, and balance. Her paintings and sculptures negotiate a harmony between old and new, reinterpreting traditional art forms like Jeongganbo and Chunaengmu in contemporary contexts. (1) References to the four seasons, works evoking sound and movement, and the balancing of near and far views create a sense of wholeness and inevitability, asking viewers to find peace and presence in the here and now.On view in the gallery are works from Kang’s celebrated series Jeong, Mat, Narrow Meadow, and Mora, as well as two new sculpture series, Mountain and Column. For each of these bodies of work, she has developed a distinct formal vocabulary that combines traditional techniques with specific materials to create dynamic forms inspired by Korean culture yet deeply engaged with contemporary social issues and art history. Rooted in her training as a traditional painter, Kang’s works explore how, despite our many differences, we remain connected. In focusing on how ideas of the past manifest today, Kang employs the traditional concept of “Jinkyung,” or “true-view,” painting, which seeks to represent the essence of the subject through the principle of shared symbolism. In this way, her work frames what she describes as “the beautiful moment of sharing time,” assisting us in being present in a space where “we can constantly reconcile imbalances and conflicts and achieve complete harmony with each other.”* Quoted in Connie Butler, “The Subtle Smile: Suki Seokyeong Kang’s Sympathetic Object,” in Willow Drum Oriole (Seoul: Leeum Museum of Art, 2023). All quotes by the artist are from this exhibition catalogue.(1) Jeongganbo is a type of musical notation dating back to the Joseon dynasty, in which the duration and pitch of sounds are notated within a square grid shaped like the character “Jeong” (井).

Yet, her photographs are not necessarily about what objects appear within them but rather about the medium of photography itself.Letinsky explains, “I make pictures of very ordinary things in a way that destabilizes and questions the camera’s authority while also indulging in its sexiness, solicitating a visual pleasure that is tethered to other senses.” Letinsky complicates the singular point of view of the camera by building frames within frames and precariously positioning objects in relation to one another. In reference to her innovative picture spaces, Letinsky notes, “Cezanne’s still lifes described objects from multiple perspectives so as to refer to perception being a constantly shifting process. I try to harness this, to articulate that we’ve two eyes and are ambulant living beings.”Through her work, Letinsky questions what is necessary to make a photograph that is considered “good.” Dissonance and interruption are components of her language in which objects’ perspectival positions are abstracted and gravity is elided. By working with objects associated with the home, she makes images that evoke tenderness and project an uneasy and fragile beauty.The exhibition title, For, and because of... refers to the incommensurability of things, suggesting that there is not a concrete metric by which to measure or to reckon with life events. Letinsky notes, “So the show, the work, is for, and because of the wars, because you never called me back, for the rain that watered my garden, because the train was late, for my sons, because flowers bloom…”Laura Letinsky (born 1962, Winnipeg, Canada) received her BFA from the University of Manitoba in 1986, and MFA from Yale University’s School of Art in 1991.

Deliberately subverting traditional photographic representation, the images in Midnight Swim explore time, memory and experience in nature as subjects, combining past and present in a multi-faceted approach. Graf’s work conveys his experience of nature as both ecstatic and entropic, with vegetation decaying and blossoming simultaneously.The exhibition presents photographs from two of Graf’s ongoing series, Hallucinations and Telepathic Jungle. Made with a 4x5 large format camera, the Hallucinations photographs record multiple exposures of a canopy of wisteria taken over a summer day as the light changed. Planted at his childhood home the summer he was born, the forty-year-old wisteria vine has functioned as both a touchstone and metaphor for Graf throughout much of his career. Placing colored gels over the camera lens to accentuate a tone, a sense of the day or a particular association with a mood or memory, Graf explains, “The chromatic vapor of memory is constantly swirling; these stand as testaments to the layered sensations of being engulfed in that canopy, which still feels as magical and sublime as when I was a kid.”Telepathic Jungle arose from years of experimentation with the photographic medium and its materials. Inspired by a single photograph of invasive vines growing over maple trees, Graf created a weaving maze of nature in all its unruly and merciless beauty. Exposing the negative to multiple flashes in the darkroom along with color gel filters, he then developed the large print in a handmade wooden trough, agitating the paper to create drips and visual stutters flecked across the paper. A second unique photogram is Midnight Swim, an image taken of crashing waves illuminated by a full moon. Combining seawater with photographic developer, Graf poured the mixture over the print while exposing the image onto the paper. A swirl of ultramarine blue, deep green and dark umber hues activate the image keeping it in constant motion, imbuing breath and life into the artist’s memory of the experience.Born in 1982, Bryan Graf received an MFA from Yale University in 2008 and a BFA from the Art Institute of Boston in 2005.
