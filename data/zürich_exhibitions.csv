"Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Waldmannstrasse",Zürich,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/shara-hughes-tree-farm/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Shara Hughes,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/sarah-hughes/,"When Hughes moved to New York in 2014, she had been painting interiors, calculated spaces that frame figures and prop-like objects of personal significance. Soon thereafter, she left these rooms, conjuring instead exterior scenes of swamps and lakes, dense woodlands with strokes for leaves and clearings opening to patches of thunderous faraway skies. Some vistas were framed within a proscenium of branches or the aperture of a cresting wave—pictorial devices signaling the image as having been staged. Hughes has described these ongoing works from the last decade as kinds of imaginary landscapes, most literally in that they do not depict specific places. But this further suggests how Hughes appropriates the genre as a way to think about how one might arrange color and shape on a flat surface into something recognizable.Hughes’s paintings are about painting as much as about nature, of trees grown not in soil but sprouted, as if sui generis, from the sluice of underpainting. In Tree Farm, they flaunt their inventiveness, offering the comparative play of difference within a serial format: one tall tree per vertical canvas. Each painting seems to harbor its own light source, palette, and temperature, cultivating within these distinct atmospheres specimens that arc to the physical edges of supports as if heliotropic, crown their enclosures, or fall to the loam where undergrowth rises to meet the detumescent branches. Color is everywhere saturated and pitched to maximum expressive potential, if modulated according to its site. Wits End is a conflagration of reds and signal orange cut with ribbons of turquoise, lapis, and goldenrod; by contrast, Come and Get It is a nocturne of deep purples and red-brown hills, its gangly protagonist standing erect with so many boughs—evocative of limbs—ending in orbs that redouble the celestial flecks legible as stars.Hughes here coaxes ever more possibilities for compositional generation from her evolving lexicon. Prismatic, faceted planes, arcing lines spaced or tightly striated and ordered, clustering daubs and dots, and transitions between these and other modes of applying paint might be endlessly recombined without yielding the same effects. And in any given instance, Hughes near-magically slips between having the paint signify and be: marks stand for foliage or snow or rock even as they visibly remain marks. Look at any section and watch aspects disambiguate and reverse. Like the psychological tool of the bistable image (most famously in Joseph Jastrow’s representation of the duck that is also a rabbit, but not at the same time), Hughes’s paintings point to how visual experience is organized for the maker as much as for the viewer—and how the positionality of both is very literally determinant.The title, Tree Farm, refers to Hughes’s family’s pine tree farm in western Georgia, where she spent time as a child, amidst new growth that in time came to be large enough to fell and replant. Thus does it introduce not only the shifting perspective of passage through a prepared environment, marked by the volatility of light and weather, but also how fantasy and memory mediate the encounter. Here, Hughes is likewise exhibiting for the first time a group of tabletop ceramics. These small sculptures model arboreal varieties, knobby and slender, sprightly and manicured, their glazes crackling and lustrous by turn as befits the process of firing without controlling the outcome. The makeshift grove that results invites movement to see each piece from multiple vantages and to understand them in relation. As with the accompanying paintings, they continue Hughes’s use of the nominal subject of landscape as a heuristic for experiments in generating form.Accompanying the exhibition is a curated selection of paintings by the artist’s father, Joe Hughes, on view in a cabinet next to the main gallery.Suzanne HudsonShara Hughes was born in 1981 in Atlanta, GA, US, and lives and works in Brooklyn, NY, US.

Baghramian’s geometric shapes and organic forms, invariably made from cast aluminum and held or supported by armatures, hooks and rods, rather confront their beholders with subtle evocations of poses and postures, demeanors and dispositions. Placed at the margins or dangling from the ceiling of the exhibition space, these sculptures, as they appear to withdraw, stand up or recline (as in her 2023 outdoor work ‘S’adossant (Pauline),’ currently on view at MoMA in New York), poignantly evoke both the social strictures and potential mutability of embodiment, thereby offering striking allegories—or models—of contemporary subject positions.Intensifying her preceding interrogation of the poetics and politics of representing and addressing the human figure, the syntax and placement of her new works—all of which conjure bent or bowed bodies (as suggested by the title addition ‘se ployant’)—starts from the double meaning of the term ‘mass.’ Aligning a central facet of any sculpture, ‘mass’ is palpable even when it is absent or negated. In this new body of work, the artist questions the pressures (figuratively or literally) exerted on the individual elements of any given group arrangement (be it social or artistic, or both). In this way, Baghramian’s abstract works intend to explore the interstices between conforming and retreating and the space of leeway they may offer for perception, critique and reflection.",Nairy Baghramian.

He has developed a complex system of symbols consisting of various pictograms and colors as a means of tackling the question of the structure of the world, and with his system he aims to portray in symbols every aspect of the human condition in different combinations. Every color has a specific symbolic value attached to it. For example, green stands for material, blue for the everyday world, yellow for ideas, white and black for language and red for the subjective. The model of perception that Mullican calls the theory of the five worlds serves him as a system of order for his method of working as an artist. It illustrates the relationship between the world and its representation. The artist is particularly interested in how we charge symbols and systems of symbols with meaning. —Nikolaus Bischoff",Matt Mullican: What They See,"Rämistrasse 37, CH-8001","Tue-Fri 11am-6.30pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 7 Jun  - 10 Aug 2024

Instead it is crucial for him to let his oeuvre speak for itself, to tell the viewers as little as possible about his art in advance - in this way the content can be inscribed into the works by those experiencing them through a performative gesture (or even be created in the first place). For example, our press release for the exhibition ''Bruno Jakob: My Paintings'' from 2006, had a gap between the title and the text, according to the artist's wishes.Again and Again and Again / Pump the Cyber Space shows new works on paper, painted with water, energy and brain waves as well as new paintings and a 24-hour performance. Since the late 1970s, Bruno Jakob has been exploring the idea of the invisible, the unfinished, the provisional, the precarious and the ephemeral - all aspects that are still part of his painting today. The use of unusual, even immaterial painting media or media that fade again after the brush has been applied, such as various types of water, steam, energy, brainwaves, love, pain, emotions and sound, are characteristic for the artist: colour and colour pigments, for example, are nowhere to be found in his ongoing series of self-proclaimed Invisible Paintings. This results in viewers looking at seemingly empty, naked, untreated or apparently unfinished painting surfaces.During his career, the artist has intensively explored the painting process and meta-painting, which examines and questions painting itself and the means of painting. His paintings confront us with their representational nature, their objecthood, the haptic of the paper and the canvas or even the wall itself and are both political and poetic. Daily movements, such as the everyday movement through landscapes and cityscapes, have recently gained importance in the creation of his works. The titles of the works play a central role and lend them a narrative level. Although Jakob paints figurative or abstract motifs with brushes, these are often transparent to the human eye - after the act of painting, which is often carried out as a performance - and therefore become invisible, blur or fade over time. At the centre of his work are the sensations of each individual and not a definite understanding of his works: hence the need for a blank, unwritten sheet of paper instead of an exhibition text.Bruno Jakob's works have been exhibited internationally since 1988, particularly in his chosen hometown of New York. Works by the artist have been shown in countless solo and group exhibitions (including performative works - often performed with the Swiss artist and musician Hans Witschi), including Museum Tinguely, Basel, Switzerland (2022/2015), Helvetia Foyer, Basel, Switzerland (2020), Deutsches Haus, New York (2019), Kunsthaus Zofingen, Switzerland (2017), Kunsthaus Baselland, Muttenz, Switzerland (2016), Kunsthaus Glarus, Switzerland (2015), Kunstmuseum Luzern, Switzerland (2012), Haus Konstruktiv, Zurich, Switzerland (2011) and MoMA New York (2010). In 2014, Bruno Jakob was awarded the Ricola Collection Prize, Laufen, Switzerland. In 2011, Bruno Jakob was invited to show two installations at the 54th Venice Biennale in the Arsenale and in the main pavilion (curated by Bice Curiger). Works by the artist can be found in the collection of the Aargauer Kunsthaus, Switzerland, the Ricola Collection, Switzerland, the collection of the Kunsthaus Lichtenstein or the Art Collection of the Swiss Confederation, to name a few.",Bruno Jakob: Again and Again and Again,"Rämistrasse 33, 8001","Wed-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 26 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024
