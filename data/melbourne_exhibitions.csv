It is the first of a series that epitomises A&A’s exploration of sculptural forms that intentionally blur the boundaries between art, craftsmanship, and design. The cabinet is visually captivating, standing tall with sinuous, curvy shapes and a bold colour palette rendered in the centuries-old craft of straw marquetry. The Kissing Cabinet’s true enchantment unfolds as it gracefully turns inside out, revealing hidden forms and secret compartments. On closing, the shapes converge like abstracted kissing lips. This captivating blend of soft movement and hidden function elevates The Kissing Cabinet beyond furniture, transforming it into a poetic and sensual object.",A&A: The Kissing Cabinet,"Level 5, 104 Exhibition St., VIC 3000","Tue-Fri 10am-5pm, Sat 1pm-4pm", 25 May  - 1 Jun 2024
