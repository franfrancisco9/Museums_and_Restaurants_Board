Barbara Thumm,Berlin,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/maria-magdalena-campos-pons-i-heard-the-spirits-voices-escuche-la-voz-de-los-espiritus/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",María Magdalena Campos-Pons,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/maria-magdalena-campos-pons/,"Born in Matanzas province, Cuba, the renowned interdisciplinary artist María Magdalena Campos-Pons works with performance, painting, photography, video, music, and sculpture. Campos-Pons explores themes of identity, race, gender, diaspora, and spirituality in her work, impulsed by her transcultural Nigerian, Chinese, and Spanish heritage.With an artistic career spanning over four decades, María Magdalena Campos-Pons returns to Berlin with her second solo exhibition at Galerie Barbara Thumm, featuring two new paintings, video pieces, and an installation with porcelain vessels. The exhibition offers insight into the construction and expression of the artist‘s concept of identity, interconnecting multiple religious, spiritual, and geographical factors. In her repertoire, Campos-Pons draws from her personal experience to narrate the process of identity construction, from her own exile moving from Cuba to the United States, as well as her ancestors’, who arrived to the island from Africa and China. Her oeuvre interweaves personal experiences that tackle universal and collective ones at the same time, addressing historical themes such as the African and Chinese diaspora in the Caribbean. Campos-Pons uses her art as a medium for storytelling, engaging all senses through her performances and installations, always guided by her conviction of art’s healing power.As a result of the invitation to participate in the 2008 Guangzhou triennial, Campos-Pons began investigating her Chinese ancestry and including it in her art. She created the installation “My Mother Told Me I Am Chinese: China Porcelain” (2008) for the triennial, including forty porcelain vessels and an acrylic shelf overlaying a video; Campos-Pons appears in front of a mirror performing a sort of ritual to the rhythm of music composed by Neil Leonard, while wearing a Yoruba mask which she later removes to paint her face white and cover her head with a veil, like a porcelain doll, suggesting a resemblance between the figures yet revealing a multifaceted and different appearance. The vessels evoke the relationship between Chinese porcelain used in Santería rituals (an Afro-Cuban religion combining Yoruba and Catholic elements), echoing the syncretism and presence of those cultures in herself and in Cuba. For the second and next iterations of the installation, the artist made and hand-painted each vase during her residency at the Harvard Ceramics Program in 2008, depicting landscapes of Cuba, Chinese characters and symbols, as well as Yoruba deities like Ochún, Ogún, Changó, and Yemayá, among others.In addition, Campos-Pons created a self-portrait that often accompanies the installation, titled “My Mother Told Me I Am Chinese: The Painting Lesson” (2008). In her characteristic grid-like composition, the portrait features nine or, in some cases, twenty-one, large-scale polaroids that capture her dressed as in the video from “China Porcelain” with her face painted in white. What began as the construction of an exploratory character in the past, later came to be her artistic “persona”: FeFa (standing for Familiares en el Extranjero/Family Abroad). FeFa appeared both in photos and in person in performances around the globe, as in the 11th Havana Biennial in 2012 and the 55th Venice Biennial in 2013, among many others until the present day. In 2024, she produced a new watercolor piece recreating her figure from the polaroids, to be presented at Galerie Barbara Thumm for the first time.Despite not being initiated into the Santería religion, Campos-Pons grew up among its practices and often incorporates some of its elements into her pieces, re-imagining how traditions were kept and transmitted across generations in her family. In fact, similarly to her 2008 “China porcelain” installation, in 2021-2023 she created the series “Liminal Circularity, Family Whisper,” consisting of six portraits representing Yoruba-Santería deities but now in the form of some of her women relatives. The additional portraits were shown at the 2023 Sharjah Biennial and most recently at the 2024 Diriyah Biennial, and two new triptychs will be on view for the first time at Galerie Barbara Thumm. The artworks delve into the artist‘s familial cultural traditions and how they have been passed down across generations, hence the “circularity” in the title. In “(Portrait #4) Cousin María, Feast for Ogún,” a woman honors Ogún, deity of iron and war, holding a platter of fruits commonly used in ritual practices (mamey, banana, and watermelon) while seating on an iron stool and resting her feet over a machete, Ogún’s symbol. The pink flowers in the background also allude to the orisha, they are “Yerba Diez del Día,” used as offerings in rituals. “Portrait #5” portrays a scene associated with Yemayá, deity of the sea and maternity, depicting a woman in a blue dress standing on coral-patterned spheres and symbolic blue flowers also used as offerings, like blue jasmine, hydrangeas, blue plumbago, and larkspurs. In front of each portrait stands a small glass stool, a replica of a family heirloom that Campos-Pons’ includes as a symbol of tradition and shared heritage between the women in her family.The gallery’s project space presents a series of videos by the artist in collaboration with Kamaal Malak, some of which were showcased during the performance “A Mother‘s River of Tears” in her solo exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum in New York in 2023. For this occasion, Campos-Pons performed a ritual in commemoration of violence and injustices against black people, accompanied by other women and live music by Kamaal Malak. Campos-Pons described this performance and its elements as “a call to radical love in unity, radical love in the present, radical love in healing, radical love in dreaming together of a better future, a cleansing of space, a cleansing of history.” (1)The exhibiton offers a glimpse into some of the works of this multifaceted artist, a selection of pieces made years apart that continue to respond to Campos-Pons’ ever-lasting and ever-changing quest to explore her identity. Her works lead us to question absolute truths about who we are and how we define ourselves (usually constructed by oral traditions passed down in the family). More importantly, the exhibition extends an invitation to consider identity as a process that is built every day, a matter of the present rather than a static one anchored in the past.María Magdalena Campos-Pons‘ works have been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston), the Whitney Museum, the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, among others. She has also presented her pieces at events and venues around the world such as the Guangzhou Triennial, Dak‘Art, the Venice Biennial, the Havana Biennial, the Sharjah Biennial, the Johannesburg Biennial, and most recently at the Diriyah Biennial. She founded the projects Intermittent Rivers in Matanzas, Cuba, Engine for Art Democracy and Justice at Vanderbilt with Vanderbilt and Frist University, and When We Gather. Campos-Pons currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee.(1) Interview for the Brooklyn Museum, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyxFNPb4ht4",María Magdalena Campos-Pons: I Heard the Spirits’ Voices / Escuché la Voz de Los Espíritus,"Markgrafenstrasse 68, D-10969",Wed-Sat 12-6pm, 27 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

He is the precise observer who debunked the illusion of individuality and made us aware of the uniformity of our images of life.Warhol’s late works also evoke an artistic language of the »myths of everyday life« (Roland Barthes), template-like images of the consciousness industry and the power of commodity consumption from everyday American culture: identity-forming images from a time in which the era of digital and social media became a reflection between art and life. For Warhol, everything became the surface of an apparent utopia in which sender and receiver exchange analogue messages. In his cool agnosticism of appearances, he processed the messages from a neurotic flood of images.Based on reproductions, newspaper articles and adverts, Warhol transforms the pictorial objects he appropriates by enlarging, hatching and fragmenting them in his drawings. The painterly gesture of the forms and the use of ink and acrylic paint on paper to create strong black and white contrasts take Warhol to the boundaries between painting and drawing. Many years after creating early works in a ›blotted line‹ technique and the accentuated outline drawings of his artistic beginnings, he found a new freedom of expression beyond screen printing.»Andy Warhol.

Buchholz,Berlin,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/wolfgang-tillmans-10/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Wolfgang Tillmans,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/wolfgang-tillmans/,"Wolfgang Tillmans has devoted himself to creating pictures that negotiate between the things he makes, the things he finds, and the choices he makes recording, preserving, and translating the three-dimensionality of the material world. Tillmans’s new exhibition at Galerie Buchholz attests to his ongoing interest in this significant aspect of his practice: the recording of materiality and sculptural forms in his work.While rooted in the material world, Tillmans’s works are the result of an interplay of optical translations of matter, which the artist transforms through the technological use of the camera. Under his gaze, purposeful objects cease to have their specific functionality and are morphed into sculptural objects of meditation, pointing beyond their intended purpose: a steel urinal radiates sensations of texture and reflection; a large, seemingly stranded, freight container, exhibited at a 1:1 scale, invites us to look at its sheer presence and mediate on its size, color, and shape; a gigantic advertising structure acts as pure material distortion; and a tower of brussel sprouts becomes an active element in an examination of play and scale in the making of a picture.Tillmans often makes his pictures in moments of heightened awareness, moments in which he encounters a shift in his surroundings, or in moments when shifts in his surroundings activate his gaze. He finds his subjects as much as his subjects find him, a fact that is made apparent in the relatability of his pictures.In a view from the artist’s Berlin studio on a rainy day, Tillmans captures rain as it falls, freezing the raindrops with the use of new camera technology, allowing each drizzling drop to appear like a glass sphere in which the world around is mirrored as seen through a lens, upside down.Tillmans’s specific pictorial strategy is also an inquiry into the workings of our cognitive apparatus that transforms visual experiences into cognitive ones. He looks at very ordinary things, often staging them, to try to make them reachable, to make them understandable. In his still lifes nothing is purposeful, and yet they convey a sense of the constructedness of the picture that finds its echo in the constructedness of the world, which we often deem as given.Traversing the two main galleries is a sculptural display structure made of four different building-site planks, which take the artist’s interest in horizontal displays to a new distinct direction. These displays expose the exhibits laid unprotected on top, emphasizing the purity of their material presence. The leporello offset-prints and laser-prints Tillmans made for this installation are present as much as sculptural paper objects as carriers of imagery and media of information.Punctuating the exhibition are Tillmans’s Lighter works, which negotiate fundamental aspects of photographic image-making as they address the distribution of light and the distribution of space onto a given surface of paper. These folded chromogenic prints, which depict their own three-dimensional shape through shades and gradations of color, are the result of their own three-dimensional materiality exposed to light in the darkroom. Tillmans’s Lighter works always act like borders between two distinct areas of experience, of light meeting space, thereby creating color and depth through purely material means.Coinciding with the exhibition is the release of Tillmans’s second album Build from Here. Driven by a desire to explore and to expose, the album navigates joy and heartbreak amid ruin and rebuilding, embodying defiance in uncertain futures, and extending Tillmans’s multifaceted and open approach to making as a gesture towards hope. Co-produced by Tillmans with Tim Knapp and Bruno Breitzke, the album is released as a 12” vinyl record, a CD, a download, and is available on streaming sites.This exhibition marks the 13th solo show by Tillmans at Galerie Buchholz. 8 years have passed since his 2016 exhibition at the gallery in Berlin which also coincided with Gallery Weekend. In this time the artist has had a major retrospective - To look without fear - which opened at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 2022, and travelled to the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto in 2023, and closed in March 2024 at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. In addition to the North American retrospective, the exhibition Sound is Liquid was shown at the Museum moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien, Vienna in 2021 and included the premiere of his Moon in Earthlight video album. The exhibition Today Is The First Day was presented at WIELS, Brussels in 2020; and his show Rebuilding the Future was on view at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin in 2018-2019. From 2018 to 2022, Tillmans embarked on a major touring exhibition on the African continent titled Fragile which opened at the Musée d’Art Contemporain et Multimédias, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, organized by the Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen, Stuttgart, and traveled throughout Africa, including The GoDown Arts Centre, Nairobi, Kenya, the Johannesburg Art Gallery, South Africa, the Modern Art Museum-Gebre Kristos Desta Center, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the Contemporary Art Gallery, Yaoundé, Cameroon, the Museum for Science and Technology, Accra, Ghana, the Musée des Cultures Contemporaines Adama Toungara, Abobo/Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and the Art Twenty One and Centre for Contemporary Art, Lagos, Nigeria. In 2017, Tate Modern in London presented a large-scale survey of Tillmans’s work. To coincide with the show, Tillmans developed the light and sound installation South Tank transforming the Tate’s subterranean former oil tank, and that same year the Fondation Beyeler in Basel mounted a major solo exhibition, its first devoted to an artist primarily using photography.Born in 1968 in Remscheid, Germany, Wolfgang Tillmans lives and works in Berlin and London. He studied at Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design from 1990-1992. Following his earliest reception in the 1990s - a time in which he worked between London and New York - Wolfgang Tillmans was the first photographer and the first non-British artist awarded the prestigious Turner Prize, presented by Tate Britain in London. Tillmans was a professor at Städelschule in Frankfurt from 2003-2009, and in 2009 was elected to serve as an artist trustee on the board of Tate. In 2012 he was inducted into the Akademie der Künste in Berlin and in 2013 was appointed a member of the Royal Academy of Arts, London. He was the 2015 recipient of the Hasselblad Foundation’s International Award in Photography. In 2018 he was presented with the Kaiserring from the city of Goslar, one of Germany’s most prestigious art prizes. Wolfgang Tillmans was named one of the TIME 100 Most Influential People of 2023.Since 2006, Wolfgang Tillmans has operated the non-profit exhibition space Between Bridges in locations in London and Berlin, opening a new location in 2022 at Adalbertstraße 43 in Berlin. In addition to providing a venue for artists, Between Bridges has since 2017 been a foundation committed to the advancement of democracy, supporting LGBT+ rights and anti-racism work. Political activism has been a core component of Wolfgang Tillmans’s work, with direct involvement in the anti-Brexit campaign in Britain and more recently with responses to the rise in right-wing populism in Germany. At the onset of the Covid pandemic he organised the 2020Solidarity fundraising project connecting over 50 artists’ posters with 100 cultural organisations in 18 countries.",Wolfgang Tillmans,"Fasanenstraße 30, 10719",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 26 Apr  - 15 Jun 2024  
Capitain Petzel,Berlin,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/xie-nanxing-f-o-r-a-d-e-c-a-s-a/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Xie Nanxing,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/xie-nanxing/,"f o r a d e c a s a is comprised of eight paintings which represent a complete body of work. The title, an abstraction of the Portuguese “fora de casa”, as in “jogo fora de casa” – the away game – reveals this series’ origins: while visiting Lisbon Xie came across a notebook, the vibrant green pages of which were each marked with the lines of a football pitch. Perhaps a fun gift for the child whose bedroom walls are adorned with posters of footballers, or possibly a serious tool for the tactician for whom each match is an obsession. The markings of the football pitch – rendered most clearly against a comparable green background in f o r a d e c a s a # 1 – became the basis for this group of paintings, both as a loosely interpreted formal structure for each new work and as a catalyst for their content.Football is a paradox. So trivial yet so serious. It is not a matter of life and death, the great Liverpool manager Bill Shankly reputedly said: it is much more important than that. Or perhaps it is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, said Gary Lineker, the Germans always win. Painting is also a paradox, at least for Xie Nanxing. It is not the truth, he has said, but neither is it just a game. It is “more like a game that is close to the truth, or rather a truth-mimicking game”. He has expressed a “mistrust” of painting, and yet he has spent the last three decades engaged in a deliberate and meticulous studio painting practice.Nowhere is Xie’s ambivalent, conflictual attitude towards painting more apparent than in the “canvas print” technique which he has often returned to over the last fifteen years and which he uses in several of these paintings. f o r a d e c a s a # 8, for example, is ostensibly the most abstract of the paintings in the exhibition – we see a central green circle, perhaps a centre circle, overlaid with faintly stippled polychromatic marks. As we continue to look, traces of figures begin to emerge to the left of the canvas, while to the right we see a harder-edged form and a rich patch of green reminiscent of the first painting in this series. These marks are in fact the literal traces of another painting which was made on an unstretched canvas that had been laid over the top of the surface we now see, such that some of the paint seeped through. That painting was then removed, never to be shown, and we are left with its “shadows” – evidence of painting having taken place.And yet in this same series Xie Nanxing also embraces sheer painterly bravura, albeit interrupted by football scorecards, while in overtly citing Goya’s The Sleep Of Reason Produces Monsters (and not for the first time) Xie embraces his work’s place in a longer tradition of painting. Some paintings suggest abstraction, but others are uncharacteristically direct in their figuration. A football match can be tense and tactical, but it can also be an explosion of excitement. Catenaccio or heavy metal football. “Xie Nanxing’s paintings cannot be cast in the camps of either aestheticized objecthood or conceptual dematerialization”, the curator and art historian Ruth Noack has acutely observed, “they hover firmly in between”.",Xie Nanxing: f o r a d e c a s a,"Karl-Marx-Allee 45, D-10178",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 25 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024  
"Galerie Max Hetzler, Potsdamer Straße",Berlin,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/mark-grotjahn-kitchens/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Mark Grotjahn,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/mark-grotjahn/,"Over the course of three decades, Mark Grotjahn has produced a diverse oeuvre which pushes the boundaries of visual language. Encompassing painting, drawing and sculpture, his multimedia practice foregrounds the tensions and intersections between the abstract and figurative divide. The artist works in distinctive series with a meticulous, almost obsessive drive. Treading the line between geometry and gesture, Grotjahn has developed a unique pictorial lexicon that is at once idiosyncratic and continually evolving. Since his initial ‘Sign Exchange’ project in the 1990s, alongside other significant bodies of work, the artist has gone on to create his renowned and ongoing series of ‘Butterfly’ drawings, with ‘50 Kitchens’ – first shown at LACMA in 2018 – amongst them. Comprising angular motifs, a capricious sense of symmetry, reductive forms and a vibrant palette, Grotjahn seeks to challenge and upturn the hermetic structures of artistic production.The ‘Kitchen Drawings’ originate from the ‘Butterfly’ compositions, which Grotjahn has made since 2001. Conceived as one work, the series originated from a single composition created to hang in Grotjahn’s kitchen in his home. With the first drawn in black and cream pencil on a sheet of paper, the subsequent works in the series followed on from one another in chromatic pairs. Some of these are more tonal, while others explore radiating, almost complementary colours. Hung precisely to the artist’s specifications, they form a prismatic display. While the individual works are reminiscent of Op art painters, they invite movement from the viewer, more in line with the Kinetic artists of the 1970s. Impossible to view as a whole at any given moment, the works appear to shift and change, pulsating beneath the viewer’s gaze. Resulting in multiple points of view through space, as well as in motion, the different serial elements play off one another. In addition to movement, both light and the differing hues which result from the sun’s changing intensity play an important role. In this way, the work is as much comprised of the paper and coloured pencils from which the independent drawings are executed, as the viewer’s own temporal and wavering perception.This time-based element corresponds to the succession in which Grotjahn's individual compositions are made: drawn one on top of the other on the artist’s table, each new drawing seamlessly incorporates residual traces from earlier works. Michael Govan, director of the LACMA, likens this sense of flow to ‘the residue of our life events of one year, [which] may become the ground of the next. The color of each one of our years is distinctive but somehow related to one another in ways that aren’t systematic even though our day to day rituals may be repetitive. The small unexpected interruptions, messy bits, and mistakes of our lives remain inscribed in our memory. We draw around them to fill in a picture of our experience.’ (1)Colour, form, space, movement and time thus combine to form force-fields which are not unlike the polyphony of music. Tension fields and quiet movements supersede one another as the viewer turns to look at the successive drawings in the exhibition space.Mark Grotjahn (*1968, Pasadena California) lives and works in Los Angeles. The artist’s work has been the subject of solo exhibitions in institutions including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (2018); Casa Malaparte, Capri (2016); Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas; Kunstverein Freiburg (both 2014); Aspen Art Museum (2012); Portland Art Museum (2010); Kunstmuseum Thun (2007); The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2006); and Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2005).

Often using simple shapes to structure his works, the artist fuses personal influences with European tradition and American abstraction, grounding vast scale and gesture with visual delicacy and a sense of vulnerability.Comprising new paintings, drawings and aquatints, the exhibition presents works from important series including ‘Wall of Light’ which has its origins in a watercolour from the 1980s and ‘Landlines’, ongoing since the late 1990s. Also included are more recently initiated hybrids of these, such as the ‘Wall Landlines’ and ‘Nets and Cages’.The warm hued Wall Red Blue, 2023, alongside the cooler Wall Pinks Blue, 2023, are among the latest additions to Scully’s ‘Wall of Light’ series, in which the arranged blocks of colour almost, but not quite, touch. Reminiscent of delicate cracks in a wall, this allows for glimpses of the lighter pigment beneath the paint to seep through. Two works on aluminium from the ‘Landlines’ series, both painted this year, take up the artist’s fascination for the horizon lines separating sea, sky and land. The contrasting light, weight, texture and spirit of these elements forms a fundamental part of Scully’s approach to the composition of space and colour.Dark Yet 8.15.23, 2023, the monumental-scale work which gives the exhibition its title, belongs to the series of ‘Wall Landlines’. The work combines the horizontal bands from Scully’s earlier ‘Landlines’ works with an ‘inset’ – a painting within a painting – of the coloured blocks typical of the ‘Wall of Light’ series. Insets have appeared in many of Scully’s multi-part constructions in the past forty years: the artist uses them to evoke a double experience, almost like a mother-child association, as well as a haptic composition which sits somewhere between painting and sculpture.Three drawings, one from each of the main series represented in the exhibition, accompany the paintings, showing the genesis of these often very large-scale works on a more intimate scale. The selection of works is completed by five aquatints, all from 2023. This printmaking technique produces lines and areas of tone which are painterly in appearance, thereby adapting the spirit and formal vocabulary of Scully’s paintings into etchings.Scully's works draw directly from experience and nature, as much as from a sensitive receptivity for places, stories, human vulnerability, emotional nuances and vibrations of light. Questioning the prerequisites of abstraction – the aesthetics of pure form, pure surface and pure colour – the artist emphasises the intrinsic value of artistic means which lies at the very centre of his work.Sean Scully (*1945, Dublin, Ireland) lives and works between New York, USA; Bavaria, Germany; Aix-en-Provence, France; and London, UK.

"Max Hetzler, Goethestr.",Berlin,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/tursic-mille-stains-stars-and-other-catastrophes/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Tursic & Mille,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/ida-tursic-wilfried-mille/,"Comprising paintings, works on paper and sculpture from across several series, the exhibition centres on the concept of ‘catastrophe’ as a creative principle. In mathematics, a catastrophe refers to the point at which a function, triggered by minor variations, abruptly changes form. Similarly, Tursic & Mille’s work – characterised by elements of collage, art historical associations, and a détournement of painting’s intentions – invites pictorial and semantic catastrophes to unfold. The catastrophe becomes the very essence of painting. After all, all painting begins with a stain on a support.Presented for the first time are 160 abstract works on paper from Tursic & Mille’s ongoing series of ‘Papers’, initiated in the early 2000s. Comprised of A3 sheets of paper on which the artists test colours and wipe their brushes, these works act as ‘evidence of the painting process itself […] reflecting our way of doing things, our way of thinking about painting, and giving pride of place to the process itself in the intimacy of the studio, like a logbook, a diary.’ (1) Brimming with spontaneous energy, the compositions eschew all intentions, posing the fundamental question of ‘what to do’ and reinforcing the empirical idea of simply ‘doing’.The sculptural piece Sisyphe (Time Mass), 2016–2023, explores this question in the third dimension. The work presents seven years of excess paint from the duo’s studio, accumulated on a single panel in the form of a growing mound. Here, the artists conjure a creative catastrophe of its own, namely the reality of painting as a Sisyphean task – a futile heap of material which embodies the artists’ endless attempt at understanding the world around them.Several new paintings on canvas recycle source material from the artists’ studio. Depicting a pair of enlarged hands, Detail, 2024, is based on a printed detail that was used for an earlier painting in 2014. In the present work, the scotch tape and yellow paint stains from the original print-out have been transcribed and immortalised in paint. Black and White Piece, another oil painting from 2024, results from a similar process; depicting a vast mountain range, the painting’s upper left corner renders a tear in the original source material. In the artists’ visual realm, all landscapes are the result of catastrophes at work, be they geological or pictorial. Similarly, Tursic & Mille’s images feed on themselves, generating new possibilities in the process of their creation. The effect, the artists explain, is that ‘everything becomes still life.’ The original nature of the subject shifts to a radically empirical one: the painted object as a subject in itself.Further illustrating the duo’s commitment to pictorial renewal, six paintings from the artists’ ongoing series of ‘Modifications’ summon the work of Jean-Honoré Fragonard (1732–1806), Antoine Vollon (1833–1900) and Jean-Bapstiste Greuze (1725–1805), drawing on their masterworks as literal and conceptual backdrops against which to set new interventions. The blank canvas, Tursic & Mille seem to point out, is a myth.In an age defined by its endless circulation of content and vast well of material, Tursic & Mille challenge linear modes of art making and embrace chance encounters as the very essence of painting. The result is an eternal renegotiation of disorder and order, accident and intent. It is indeed by embracing catastrophe that the artists renew their quest for ways to express the world through paint.Ida Tursic (*1974, Belgrade, Serbia) and Wilfried Mille (*1974, Boulogne-Sur-Mer, France) live and work in Mazamet, France. Tursic & Mille’s work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at numerous institutions, most recently including FRAC – Fonds regional d’art contemporain de Normandie, Caen (2023); Consortium Museum, Dijon (2022); Le Portique, Le Havre (2021); Muzeum Sztuki, Łodz (2020); Fondation d’Entreprise Ricard, Paris (2017); Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dole (2011); FRAC Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand (2011) and Le Musée de Serignan (2008–2009). The artist duo were the recipients of the Fondation Simone et Cino Del Duca prize in 2020 and the Fondation d’Entreprise Ricard Prize in 2009. They were nominated for the Marcel Duchamp Prize in 2019.Tursic & Mille’s works are in the permanent collections of the Berardo Collection, Lisbon; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris; FNAC – Fonds National d'Art Contemporain, Paris; FRAC –Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand; FRAC - Bourgogne, Dijon; FRAC – Le Plateau, Paris; Le Consortium, Dijon; Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dôle; and Musée Régional d’Art Contemporain de Sérignan, among others.(1) Tursic & Mille, 2024.","Tursic & Mille: Stains, Stars and other Catastrophes","Goethestraße 2/3, 10623",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 3 May  - 1 Jun 2024

Pegah’s bouquets center around the iconographic “crown imperial” – a flower native to the mountainous region stretching from Turkey to the Himalayan foothills. Through the flower, which comes to symbolize a distant and imaginary homeland, the viewer is invited to explore the topics of hybrid identity and diasporic experience.Viewers are pulled into the front room of the gallery by a backdrop of deep-blue walls and yellow bars. In this first space a fictional short film introduces them to Roya, a London-born painter and bus driver with Iranian heritage. Through her character, playing the role of the artist of the impossible bouquets, the viewer learns about the dissonance between diasporic imaginary and reality.In the central room of the gallery, visitors are engulfed in further interpretations of the still life, ranging from a multiperspective diptych to isolated deconstructions and a contemporary reinterpretation of the bouquet. The painted works are accompanied by selected film stills oscillating between the urban context of London and the natural hillscapes of Iran, adding interpretative tension to the circumstances under which the floral arrangements were produced historically and today.Pegah Keshmirshekan is a promising artist, who displays conceptual depth and masterful technique in her oeuvre of painting, film and photography. She has studied fine arts at UdK, Berlin and Central St. Martins, in London. Her work has been displayed in several group exhibitions in Berlin, London, and Tehran.",Pegah Keshmirshekan: Imaginary Homeland,"Merseburgerstrasse 14, 10823","Mon-Fri 11.30am-2pm & 3.30pm-6.30pm, Sat-Sun 1pm-4.30pm", 19 Apr  - 16 Jun 2024
