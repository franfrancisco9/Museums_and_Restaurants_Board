Ceramicists began celebrating the simplicity and sincerity of their medium following the tenets of the Art Nouveau and Art Deco movements sweeping Europe. The same visual language can also be seen in Simonsson's new works.Arriving in Galerie Forsblom’s main exhibition space is like stepping into a sculpture gallery of yesteryear. The colossal centerpiece is the imposing Waking Dream sculpture. Scale is a theme that has preoccupied Simonsson for some years now, and his latest pieces are striking in their vast variations in size. By playing with different scales, Simonsson poses the question: how do dimensions affect the essence of the sculpture? The larger-than-life-size adds special resonance to his giant sculptures of children’s building blocks. Simonsson created the oversized blocks during the pandemic when he spent extended periods at home looking after his young twins, prompting him to wonder: who ultimately parents and raises us? Oversized dimensions similarly dialed up the impact of Simonsson’s signature Moss People presented at France's 2022 Lille3000 Utopia Festival. The giant, 4.5-meter-tall moss figures were a striking spectacle lining the streets of the downtown. This summer, the same mossy giants will invade the center of Helsinki, taking over the courtyard of Amos Rex.Kim Simonsson graduated with a major in ceramics from the University of Arts and Design in 2000. Today, he is an internationally noted artist found in foreign and Finnish museums, including the Victoria and Albert, the Museum of Contemporary Kiasma Art, and the EMMA Espoo Museum of Modern Art. Ten of his 4.5-meter moss figures were displayed prominently as a townscape installation at the Lille3000 Utopia Festival, and he also contributed an installation of 28 Moss People to the 16th Lyon Biennale in 2022.",Kim Simonsson: Grower,"Yrjönkatu 22, 00120","Tue-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat-Sun 12-4pm", 26 Apr  - 2 Jun 2024

She paints subjects as seemingly nondescript as clothing piled on a chair or a tea bag sagging on the edge of the kitchen sink. How can something so apparently trivial be transformed into something so spellbinding on canvas?Suikkanen takes inspiration from slow-paced films and books in which the storyline seems to move nowhere. Through her paintings, she strives to capture the lingering inertia of arrested moments that verge upon tedium. Suikkanen describes her method as being partly intuitive. Sometimes, a nuanced color might inspire her to replicate exactly the same shade on canvas. Occasionally, she might stumble upon a suitable theme after an unremarkable daily occurrence – a forgettable experience such as trying on a shirt that has grown too tight is a mundane incident, but one that imparts a tragicomic narrative that lends itself consummately to a painting. Suikkanen records her observations as cellphone photos and text snippets, which she jots down whenever she notices anything of interest. She then harnesses these random observations in the studio as raw material in her painting process.Suikkanen’s recent work has grown progressively more stripped-down and minimalistic both in subject matter and style. In her latest paintings, she pays growing attention to polishing her compositions and perfecting her subtle treatment of color. The process often presents a challenge that spurs the artist to delve into a certain theme. How can the paintbrush be employed to create an illusion of fluffy softness like the texture of a knitted woolly hood? And how can different shades be combined so that the color planes leap to life upon our retinas?Saimi Suikkanen (b.1994) graduated with a master’s degree in fine arts from Helsinki’s Academy of Fine Arts (in 2022) and a degree in painting from the Saimaa University of Applied Sciences in 2017. She has held several solo exhibitions and participated in group exhibitions in Finland and internationally. Her work has been acquired for the collection of the National Union of University Students in Finland and the Finnish Art Society’s annual art raffle.The exhibition was supported by the Kone Foundation.",Saimi Suikkanen: Soft Light,"Yrjönkatu 22, 00120","Tue-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat-Sun 12-4pm", 26 Apr  - 2 Jun 2024  
Forsblom,Helsinki,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/henry-wuorila-stenberg/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Henry Wuorila-Stenberg,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/henry-wuorila-stenberg/,"Henry Wuorila-Stenberg’s paintings emanate from a silent void – a void that is never static but instead keeps evolving in its nuances and cadences. For Wuorila-Stenberg, painting is a form of meditation and a quest for peace. Meditation has played a very important role in the artist’s life for over forty years, and so it is only natural that his creative process flows from a similar all-encompassing, meditative state of emptying one’s mind. His paintings' psychological and spiritual content seems to transcend what can be expressed in words. It is important for Wuorila-Stenberg that each painting has a fundamentally ineffable core. How can something for which there are no words be verbalized? Language fails as we confront a pristine rush of emotions that shakes us to our core.Wuorila-Stenberg’s expressionistic style is influenced by the years he spent studying art in West Berlin during the 1970s. His expressionism finds a counterpart in his paintings' equally striking surrealist elements. Themes and events related to the artist’s own life are his primary source of inspiration, and his chosen colors are also linked to personal experiences. The artist in fact describes his relationship with color as an intensely psychological one. His raw choreographies of color impart their very own narratives, and their evocative textures endow color with a powerful material presence in his paintings.Wuorila-Stenberg’s process is totally intuitive: when he picks up the paintbrush, he has no idea where the journey will lead. The crucial thing is that he achieves a state of flow, and the stages and traces of the process must be visible on the canvas. Thumbing his nose at convention, Wuorila-Stenberg has always regarded painting as a vehicle of self-expression and identity-building. He describes painting as having grown easier with age; in his youth, he felt a greater need to define his place within the context of art history, but these days, he allows the process to flow freely, unfettered by labels and definitions.Henry Wuorila-Stenberg (b. 1949) ranks among Finland’s most acclaimed painters. This year marks his 50th artist anniversary. Wuorila-Stenberg has received numerous accolades, including the Pro Finlandia medal in 2004 and the Finland Award in 1996. His work is represented in the collections of the Gothenburg Museum of Art, EMMA Espoo Museum of Modern Art, HAM Helsinki Art Museum, the Wäinö Aaltonen Museum, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma. He has held solo exhibitions at venues including the Wäinö Aaltonen Museum, HAM Helsinki Art Museum, Hyvinkää Art Museum and Oulu Art Museum.",Henry Wuorila-Stenberg,"Yrjönkatu 22, 00120","Tue-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat-Sun 12-4pm", 26 Apr  - 2 Jun 2024
