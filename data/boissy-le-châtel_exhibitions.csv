Suspended Perimeter – Love Difference is an example of this: this work, composed of a series of mirrors placed in a circle, aims to reflect on the concept of humanity, sublimating the differences to be found both in individuals and social groups. Another example is Labirinto e Grande Pozzo which is capable of simultaneously provoking disorientation and will power. In the middle of the work there is a well, its bottom made of mirror that leads to a losing of the self and a consequent promise of future discoveries.A recurrent symbol is the Terzo Paradiso; made up of a reconfiguration of the mathematic infinity symbol, it represents a fundamental concept in Pistoletto’s artistic practice, which is based on the fusion of the “First Paradise” (in which human beings were completely integrated into nature) with the “Second Paradise” (the artificial world developed through science and technology). The last dimension, depicted in the symbol of a third central circle, represents the third phase of humanity that is realized via creating a balanced connection between artifice and nature, taking the form of a passage to an unprecedented stage of global civilization, indispensable for insuring the human race’s survival.Another important work in the exhibition is Porte Uffizi, an environment that is made up of a series of rooms that hold the names of the various offices of Cittadellarte, a project started by Pistoletto with the intention to inspire and produce a responsible societal change through ideas and initiatives of a creative nature. Each office is dedicated to a specific area: Art, Education, Ecology, Economy, Politics, Spirituality, Production, Work, Communication, Architecture, Fashion and Nutrition. The visitor can subsequently cross over this spatial representation of Cittadellarte’s philosophy that for more than twenty years has operatively brought an artistic intervention into every part of civil society in order to contribute to shaping the deep epochal changes that actually occur.The exhibition continues on the first floor with other works, such as the Quadri Specchianti series that depicts Cuban people, the images for which were selected by the artist after his first trip to Havana in 2014. We then find Mar Mediterraneo founded in 2002 in Biella at Cittadellarte, with the aim of creating new perspectives that transcend cultural diversity borders. Finally, it’s worth mentioning the historic piece Sfera di Giornali, made in the 1960s as a physical articulation of the dynamic and evolving everyday events of the time. At the end of 1967, Pistoletto reproposed this sphere rolling it through Turin, subsequently giving it its name Scultura da passeggio.MICHELANGELO PISTOLETTOMichelangelo Pistoletto was born in Biella in 1933. In 1962 he created the Mirror Paintings with which he quickly achieved international recognition. He is considered one of the precursors and protagonists of Arte Povera with his Oggetti in meno (1965-1966) and the Venere degli stracci (1967). Starting from 1967, outside traditional exhibition spaces, he conceived and created actions that constituted the first manifestations of the “creative collaboration” that he would go on to develop over the following decades, bringing together artists from different disciplines and increasingly wider sectors of society. In the nineties he founded Cittadellarte in Biella, placing art in relation to different areas of society in order to inspire and produce a responsible transformation of society. He has received countless international awards, including the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement of the Venice Biennale in 2003 and in 2007 the Wolf Foundation Prize in Arts “for his constantly creative career as an artist, educator and activator, whose tireless intelligence has given way to premonitory art forms that contribute to a new understanding of the world ”. In 2017 his latest book edited by Actes Sud, Hominitheism and Demopraxy, was released, a manifesto for a regeneration of society published by Chiarelettere. Works by him are present in major contemporary art museums.GALLERIA CONTINUA est ravie de présenter une nouvelle exposition personnelle de l’artiste Michelangelo Pistoletto intitulée 60 Ans d’Identités et d’Altérités, réunissant des travaux tirés de différentes phases du parcours de l’un des protagonistes les plus marquants du mouvement de l’Arte Povera, illustrant le caractère muable de la nature ainsi que la constante évolution des recherches de l’artiste.L’exposition commence à l’extérieur des Moulins avec une œuvre nommée Il tondo delle otto porte, dans laquelle on reconnaît le « Segno Arte », un élément caractérisé par l’intersection de deux triangles qui encadreraient un corps humain dont les bras seraient levés et les jambes écartées. Il s’agit d’un symbole personnel, distinct des symboles religieux, politiques ou publicitaires, qui fournit la clé permettant de franchir la porte de l’art en donnant naissance à un espace intime et partagé.L’exposition se poursuit au rez-de-chaussée. Le visiteur est alors accueilli par de larges installations qui créent un lien entre l’espace et le grand public qui le fréquente, avec notamment l’exemple de Suspended Perimeter – Love Difference: cette œuvre, composée d’une série de miroirs placés en cercle, cherche à refléter le concept d’humanité en sublimant les différences, aussi bien entre les individus qu’entre les groupes sociaux. Ou encore Labirinto e Grande Pozzo, une œuvre capable de provoquer à la fois la désorientation et la volonté. En son sein se trouve un puits dont le fond est composé d’un miroir menant à la perte de soi ainsi qu’à une promesse conséquente de découvertes futures.Le Terzo Paradiso, né d’une reconfiguration du symbole mathématique représentant l’infini, constitue un symbole récurrent. Il représente un concept clé de la pratique artistique de Pistoletto : la fusion entre le « Premier Paradis » (où les êtres humains étaient entièrement intégrés dans la nature) et le « Deuxième Paradis » (le monde artificiel développé par le biais de la science et de la technologie). La dernière dimension, représentée par un troisième cercle central, représente la troisième phase de l’humanité, dans laquelle un équilibre se crée entre artifice et nature. Elle représente le passage de la civilisation mondiale à un stade sans précédent et indispensable à la survie de la race humaine.Porte Uffizi est également une œuvre importante de l’exposition. Il s’agit d’un environnement composé d’une série de pièces portant le nom des différents départements de la Cittadellarte, un projet entamé par Pistoletto dans le but d’inspirer et de produire un changement sociétal responsable grâce à des idées et des initiatives d’une nature créative. Chaque département est dédié à un domaine particulier: Art, Éducation, Écologie, Politique, Spiritualité, Production, Travail, Communication, Architecture, Mode et Nutrition. Les visiteurs sont ainsi invités à parcourir cette représentation spatiale de la philosophie de la Cittadellarte qui, depuis plus de vingt ans, engendre de manière opérationnelle une intervention artistique dans tous les domaines de la société civile afin de contribuer à la formation des changements profonds et marquants qui se produisent.L’exposition se poursuit au premier étage avec d’autres œuvres, telles que la série Quadri Specchianti qui dépeint le peuple cubain. Ces images ont été sélectionnées par l’artiste après son premier voyage à La Havane en 2014. On trouve ensuite Mar Mediterraneo, mouvement fondé à Bielle à la Cittadellarte visant à créer de nouvelles perspectives transcendant les frontières de la diversité culturelle. Enfin, Sfera di Giornali est une œuvre historique créée dans les années 60 et définie comme une articulation physique des événements quotidiens, dynamiques et évolutifs de l’époque. À la fin de l’année 1967, Pistoletto a proposé cette sphère à nouveau en la faisant rouler dans les rues de Turin et en l’intitulant par la suite Scultura da passeggio.MICHELANGELO PISTOLETTOMichelangelo Pistoletto est né à Biella en 1933. En 1962, il crée les Tableaux-miroirs avec lesquelles il obtient rapidement une reconnaissance internationale. Il est considéré comme l’un des précurseurs et protagonistes de l’Arte Povera avec ses Oggetti in meno (1965-1966) et la Venere degli stracci (1967). À partir de 1967, en dehors des espaces d’exposition traditionnels, il conçoit et réalise des actions qui constituent les premières manifestations de la “collaboration créative” qu’il va développer au cours des décennies suivantes, en réunissant des artistes de différentes disciplines et des secteurs de plus en plus larges de la société. Dans les années 90, il fonde la Cittadellarte à Biella, plaçant l’art en relation avec différents domaines de la société afin d’inspirer et de produire une transformation responsable de la société. Il a reçu d’innombrables prix internationaux, dont le Lion d’or pour l’ensemble de sa carrière à la Biennale de Venise en 2003 et, en 2007, le prix de la Fondation Wolf pour les arts “ pour sa carrière constamment créative d’artiste, d’éducateur et d’activateur, dont l’intelligence infatigable a donné lieu à des formes d’art prémonitoires qui contribuent à une nouvelle compréhension du monde “. En 2017 est sorti son dernier livre, Hominithéisme et Démopraxie, édité par Actes Sud, un manifeste pour une régénération de la société publié aux éditions Chiarelettere.

Continua Les Moulins,Boissy-le-Châtel,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/julio-le-parc-aurora/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Julio le Parc,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼julio-le-parc/,"Presented at GALLERIA CONTINUA / Les Moulins in a museum-scale scenography, Aurora brings together a selection of nearly seventy works representative of the artist’s singular artistic language from the 1960s to the present day. These range across a variety of formats and media: acrylic paintings on canvas from iconic series, two- and three-dimensional modulations and contortions in stainless steel, wood or metal, works from the Lumières series, both historical and recent, and a monumental installation over five metres high. The exhibition is complemented by a unique virtual reality experience.Aurora opens on the ground floor of the Moulin de Boissy with a display of paintings on canvas in full colour, paying tribute to the beauty and complexity of Julio Le Parc’s systems, based on the notion of surface, including pieces from Series 15, which he began in the early 1970s. Le Parc extended his research to include colour in 1959. Not only did the artist any trace of manual execution, of “brushstrokes”, but also any subjective composition. He chose fourteen colours, which he felt summed up all the possible variations of chromatic mixtures, and used them pure, uncut with black or white. Using this chromatic spectrum as a starting point, he created increasingly complex combinations, based on systems that were both rigorous and simple. Starting with one or two horizontally shifting spectra, the artist superimposed four spectra developed vertically, horizontally or diagonally, and sometimes four new spectra as well.The major work in the exhibition, consisting of ten paintings measuring two metres by two metres, La Longue Marche [The Long Walk] was created in 1974, following an aborted project for a major retrospective at the Paris Musée d’Art Moderne, which Le Parc decided not to participate in by a coin toss. The work stands out for its monumentality. It uses the fourteen-colour system of the chromatic prism in prismatic meshes that unfold in fluid, sinuous sequences, exploring the visual effects of superimposition, weaving and overlapping. There is very little hierarchy in the organisation of the pictorial field. There is no dominant element, no centre from which the shapes radiate.Representative of the artist’s experiments with mobile elements, the monumental installation Zepelín de acero [Steel Zeppelin], dating from 2021, presented for the first time at the Fondation Hermès in Tokyo and previously unseen in France, reinterprets the use of light boxes characteristic of the artist’s research into the medium of installation, this time obscured by the steel of which they are composed. In this way, he questions a series of issues: the diversity of situations within a single experience, notions of movement, instability and probability, and the consideration of contingencies external to the work, in a characteristic distancing of his work from the notion of a stable, unique and definitive body of artwork.The exhibition continues on the first floor of the Moulin de Boissy with a selection of works entitled Modulations, in two or three dimensions and in relief, all in shades of black and white, covering a period from 1965 to 2019.The Modulations are part of a series of experiments that began in late 1974, the theme of which is rooted in the last elements treated with fourteen colour- spectrum, as well as in the research into real volumes made by the artist since 1960. The technique he used (air brush, spray paint) produced a gradation from dark to light and a fairly precise modulation of the surface, leading him to develop new themes and explore a new field of research. In continuing the artist’s experiments with the plane, these works continue to be based on simple systems of organisation, the correlation of forms depending on the same principle in each case. In this way, the artist sought to challenge his certainties, while rigorously continuing to subject his discoveries to reflection and analysis.A major contribution to recent developments in Le Parc’s work, the contortions on show (Torsion 1 to 4, dating from 2004, and Formes en contorsion [Shapes in Contorsion], 2019) are exceptional in that they demonstrate the play of chance, the play of light and the surprise of movement. This emblematic movement infused into the form has its origins in certain sets of works from the Mouvements surprise series. The process uses flexible ribbons of mirrored steel forming circles on a black background, in front of which they slowly deform due to a mechanical action coordinated by motors of different speeds.In the Moulin de Boissy’s darkroom, the exhibition also features a selection of light works rarely shown together in France, including Continuel lumière mobile [Continual Light Mobile] (1963-2013), Continuel lumière boîte [Continual light box] (1959-1965) and Continuel lumière avec quatre formes en contorsion [Continual Light with Four Shapes in Contortion] (1966-2012). Begun in late 1959, Le Parc’s experiments with light scatter light rays into small boxes, the aim of which is to reproduce, multiply and combine squares and circles using the fourteen colour-spectrum, by means of screens made from Plexiglas sheets in the shape of prisms.The artist’s aim is to capture the potential for chromatic variations thus created, and to manifest them in a single visual field. Anchored in movement, these experiments are in keeping with the artist’s principle of distancing himself from a fixed, stable and definitive body of work. The viewer is captivated by the development of a multitude of changes, the uniform medium of the elements or forms accentuating the highlighted instability. These works are characterised by their structure and, at the same time, by the absence of any composition.To complement the exhibition, GALLERIA CONTINUA is presenting for the first time Julio le Parc’s VIRTUAL LABYRINTHUS MUSEUM project through a virtual reality device. Designed by Julio Le Parc in collaboration with Juan Le Parc, using programming tools derived from video games, Julio Le Parc’s VIRTUAL LABYRINTHUS MUSEUM offers an interactive visit to a virtual museum space comprising five levels, corresponding to Le Parc’s five pictorial periods: Surfaces, Surface - couleur [colour], Modulation 1, Modulation 2, and Alchimie [Alchemy].Julio Le Parc (born 1928 in Mendoza, Argentina, and has lived and worked in Cachan, France since 1958), a major figure within kinetic and contemporary art, was one of the co-founders of the Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel (GRAV) in Paris in 1960, alongside Horacio Garcia Rossi, Francisco Sobrino, François Morellet, Joël Stein and Jean-Pierre Vasarely (Yvaral).The artist has participated in numerous solo exhibitions at leading museums and institutions such as Palais de Tokyo, Paris; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Perez Art Museum, Miami and Serpentine Gallery, London, among others. This socially committed artist and defender of human rights fought against the dictatorship in Latin America, and was temporarily expelled from France in May 1968 after taking part in the Atelier Populaire protest group and its demonstrations against the major institutions.Artistic director: Yamil le ParcStudio and Team Manager: Eduardo Berrelleza",Julio Le Parc: Aurora,"46 rue de la Ferté Gaucher, 77169",Wed-Sun 12-6pm, 17 Sep 2023 -

We don’t notice it when it accompanies us every morning. With it, we weave the softest of blankets for winter. With it, skilful hands stitch tapestries of memories. Thousands of threads must come together to dress or cover us. But sometimes, the thread no longer wants company. It sets off alone to trace a beautiful route. It becomes a line; it travels the world. In awe, we watch it drift away, following the shapes of a river, taking the curves of a tree, or drawing even the engine of a ship. Yet the thread never forgets us. Come and look closely; it keeps expanding from its starting point. It whispers the possible paths. It guides us through the labyrinth by stretching out its hands.""",De fil en aiguille,"46 rue de la Ferté Gaucher, 77169",Wed-Sun 12-6pm, 17 Sep 2023 -

On this occasion, GALLERIA CONTINUA would like to thank the artists, craftspeople, curators, professionals, institutions, collectors and everyone else who has supported its project over the years, as well as the entire gallery team for its passionate work and unstinting commitment, and of course the public who passes through the doors of its eight spaces around the world every day.From 3 June 2023 at Les Moulins, before the Paris and CILA chapters, GALLERIA CONTINUA invites you on an artistic journey through time and space, giving mind and body to the words of its three founders, and devoting an unprecedented and abundant platform to thirty years of work and passion. To give colour to the ephemera of ideas, thoughts and sensations accumulated over the years, this narrative celebrates three feelings - art, love and friendship - divided into three temporal axes - past, present and future.The Ability to Dream pays homage to all the gallery’s artists with major pieces revolving around these values, which will be repeated in the following chapters in Paris and Fontvieille. It is thanks to each of them, to the mark they have left, to their contribution, to the paths they have opened up, that the history of the gallery has been written, borrowing different silhouettes, shapes, colours and languages.The Ability to Dream presents a body of work that includes all the artists who have accompanied the gallery on this journey from the outset, as well as those who have joined more recently. Each work on display bears witness to the unique bond that has developed over the years between GALLERIA CONTINUA and the nearly seventy artists it has accompanied, to give concrete expression to the gallery’s fundamental purpose: to be a meeting point for everyone, through art and creation. Over the course of its three chapters, The Ability to Dream will invite visitors to an immersive experience made up of unusual objects, fantastical characters and installations that play with light and colour or defy the laws of physics, space and time.GALLERIA CONTINUA opened its doors in San Gimignano in 1990, the brainchild of three young friends who began their adventure in a space on Via della Rocca, in this village in the heart of Tuscany, with the aim of bringing contemporary art to a rural setting, far from the hustle and bustle of the metropolises and major cultural centres. The name of the gallery was born of the desire of the three founders to enhance the link between past, present and future, an ambition shared by all the spaces opened by the gallery around the world over the years.GALLERIA CONTINUA has expanded over the last thirty-two years and now has eight sites on five continents. It was the first foreign gallery with an international programme to open in China in 2004, before inaugurating its Les Moulins space in the Paris countryside three years later, a monumental showcase for major interventions and exhibitions. In 2015, the gallery embarked on a new journey to Havana, Cuba, with the aim of transcending all types of borders. In 2020, the gallery opened a new exhibition space in Rome, inside the St. Regis Hotel, as well as another in Brazil, in the Pacaembu sports complex (São Paulo), an inclusive space far removed from the canons of the white cube gallery. In 2021, the gallery moved to the heart of Paris, in the Marais district, with an exhibition space, a grocery shop offering exceptional products from all the countries where the gallery is based, and an ice-cream counter by Gelateria Dondoli. Also in 2021, the gallery opened a new space in Dubai, at the Burj al-Arab, an iconic sail-shaped building located near Jumeirah beach.Since its opening in 2007, GALLERIA CONTINUA / Les Moulins (The Paper Mills) has taken on a special place in the history of the gallery. Located in Boissy-le-Châtel, in the Grand Morin valley near Coulommiers, the Moulin de Boissy, 46 rue de la Ferté Gaucher, and the Moulin de Sainte-Marie, 48 rue des Papeteries, the paper mills have a rich industrial history, with the first written records dating back to the 14th century. GALLERIA CONTINUA / Les Moulins features permanent installations by iconic international contemporary artists represented by the gallery, including Anish Kapoor, Daniel Buren and Pascale Marthine Tayou.The gallery’s first space in France, this monumental and unique forty-thousand square metre space has become a creative incubator, giving rise to exceptional site-specific productions and avant-garde projects, as well as a pioneering art education programme. With free, open access, this space has been dedicated since the beginning to sharing culture with as many people as possible since it opened, by being open to the area, its residents and its schools on a daily basis, and welcoming a diversity of uses and practices, with its skatepark and relaxation areas. Over the years, the space itself has become the protagonist of certain works, which are revived today in the exhibition.In this way, GALLERIA CONTINUA demonstrates its sensitivity to contemporary creative practices by preserving the link between the past and the future. The Ability to Dream celebrates the diversity of places, cultures, individuals and communities that host and animate it, and give it its raison d’être.A second chapter will be presented at GALLERIA CONTINUA / Paris 23 June to 21 September 2023 before a third chapter at the Centre Interculturel Leila Alaoui (CILA) in Fontvieille from 8 July to 10 September 2023.",The Ability to Dream,"46 rue de la Ferté Gaucher, 77169",Wed-Sun 12-6pm, 3 Jun 2023 -
