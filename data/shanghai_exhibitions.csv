Almine Rech Shanghai,Shanghai,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/ines-longevial-les-silences-du-desir/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Inès Longevial,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/ines-longevial/,"In some corner of this world, where the boundaries between the real and the absurd merge, a giant woman stood alone, in her garden of contradictions. Like a goddess lost among humans, she clasped flowers like so many sacred relics, the petals caressing her immense skin with their fragile softness. The flowers, mute accomplices of her voluntary exile, were for her much more than simple decorations. They became shields, fragile ramparts against the ceaseless din of the world. She picked these flowers with infinite tenderness, preserving them intact like watching over a secret. Then, with a delicate gesture, she arranged them in her ears, a border between external chaos and her internal disorder. This ritual was a hymn, a subtle fusion of woman and nature, of order and disorder. Some might consider her crazy, lost in the twists and turns of her own illusions. But, for her, this was a fleeting embrace of the ephemeral beauty of the world. Stopping her ears with flowers was her way of transcending the banality of the everyday, of defying the established order. Thus, in a world where reason seems to have smothered any trace of magic, this giant woman continued to stick flowers in her ears. And maybe, just maybe, her strange ritual would inspire other souls searching for meaning. A tribute to crazy gestures and calm movements that don’t exist in this world, a world that we try by any way possible to make livable. An imagined story.— Inès LongevialThis is not a story that is already over, faded as soon as it has been told, but one of those that infuse the world by being tirelessly replayed.Inès Longevial gives life to a giant, a brute yet fragile force, evoking a repressed desire that is expressed through every stroke of paint. The lines of Cécile Coulon’s poem “My Strength” (1) echo here: “My strength smothers / Those who prevent it / From moving forward,” depicting an internal struggle that is felt in the palpable vigor and energy of the painter’s work. Faced with absurdity, she confronts herself: “My force has no meaning / it has never stopped struggling,” but discovers in her introspection a growing confidence that is in harmony with the world around her: “My strength is having understood the beauty of the mountains.”In the privacy of her studio, this female excess emerges from her brush expressing its own rules and desires. Her eyes marked with melancholy in the first painting, Tulipe noire, gradually look up at others, unrestrainedly revealing a violence, her desire, her sexuality, like a constant transformation, thus embodying the complexity of human passions and unveiling the unsuspected depths of the artistic soul. This is especially evident in her blue painting Le cri, where a naked giantess with the painter’s features shouts not from fear, but from liberation, like a conquering roar. She is faced with witnesses: other facets of humanity caught like a frieze of existence scattered with flowers.In this painter’s enchanting universe, the search for meaning is revealed as a guiding theme that runs through every painting in the exhibition. The solitary giantess “clasping flowers like sacred relics” embodies this aspiration to find a deeper meaning in a world without magic. Her unusual ritual of plugging her ears with flower stems becomes a way of “defying the established order and transcending the banality of the everyday.”Les Silences du Désir also highlights a series of small exquisite corpses drawn during the artist’s time in Spain. These patchworks show the influence of surrealist practices in Longevial’s work. Each drawing is an open window onto the artist’s unconscious, a journey into the twists and turns of the imaginary, somewhere between the real and the fantastic. Contemplating them, the viewer is invited to get lost in a maze of symbols and hidden meanings.— Elise Roche(1) Coulon, Cécile, Les Ronces, Le Castor Astral, 2018",Inès Longevial: Les Silences du Désir,"27 Huqiu Road, 2nd Floor, 200002",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 31 May  - 6 Jul 2024

Lisson Gallery Shanghai,Shanghai,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/laure-prouvost-pulled-towards-you/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Lisson-Shanghai.jpg,Laure Prouvost,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/laure-prouvost/,"Prouvost’s practice is one of continuous translation and fluid evolution. Central to her work are the themes of shifting meanings, mistranslations across languages, definitions, and the seamless fusion of creatures into a unified whole, where utopia meets surrealism. The exhibition features a glass bird enveloped in smoke, Jens (2023). This is from a series of hand-blown Murano glass creatures that Prouvost debuted in her exhibition at the Nasjonalmuseet in Oslo, 2022. Human, avian, and aquatic forms gracefully intertwine, symbolising the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of species in the age of climate change and global migration. Birds, captured in various poses, appear on the brink of transformation as if embarking on a migratory journey alongside its aquatic counterparts. Prouvost employs the transformative power of smoke to craft an immersive journey, seamlessly intertwining various facets of her practice deeply rooted in nature.The new tapestry We Will Keep Cool (Las Pozas) (2024) depicts diverse landscapes and familiar motifs in Prouvost's oeuvre. Set in British poet Edward James’ surrealistic garden ‘Las Pozas’ in Mexico, it depicts her own work Cooling system 3 (for global warming), 2018 which offers up a future proposition as a solution to global warming, as well as characters from her film They Parlaient Idéale. Translation becomes a central theme not only through language but also through converting motifs into different mediums and referencing previous artworks.Further into the space, a series of paintings The Octopus Body make their debut in China following an initial presentation in 'Stranded by Your Side' (Lisson Gallery, New York, 7 September – 14 October 2023). Each canvas, blending playful allure and sensual intrigue, is adorned with Prouvost's characteristic imagery and text that directly addresses the viewer. Going beyond her customary palette, these works embrace softer tones — pastel blues, greys, and flesh hues — conjuring the shades of a twilight seascape and the ethereal life beneath its surface. A motif that frequently inhabits Prouvost’s creative realm, depictions of swirling octopi and swimming fish symbolise the enigmatic threshold between thinking and feeling, human life and sea creatures.Amidst the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, Prouvost delved into the intricacies of our collective adaptation to a world in flux, probing the origins of language, the sensorial imparting of knowledge and charting our trajectory forward through her film Re-dit-en-un-in-a-learning (2020). The work serves as a poignant reflection on the human experience on learning and belonging, care and connection and is a sequel to Prouvost's 2017 work, DIT LEARN. She associates words to different images, destabilizing our understanding of language and its structure of knowledge, and exploring a pre-lingual world. The title itself, a play on words combining ""dit"" (a verb meaning ""to speak"" or ""speaking"") and ""learn,"" encapsulates the essence of linguistic evolution and the perpetual process of relearning. Prouvost explains, ""You cannot find the words for the images you see... All becomes one.""Prouvost's first major exhibition in Australia, 'Oui Move In You', runs from 23 March to 10 June at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne, encompassing new installations and a survey of existing work to transform ACCA’s architecture into a labyrinthine and other-worldly environment. Concurrently to the show in Shanghai, Prouvost will present a solo exhibition at Fosun Foundation in Chengdu, showcasing two films including Re-dit-en-un-in-a-learning (2020).",Laure Prouvost: Pulled Towards You,"2/F, 27 Huqiu Road, Huangpu District, 200002",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 27 Apr  - 22 Jun 2024  
Perrotin Shanghai,Shanghai,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/marty-schnapf-thresholds/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SHANGHAI-PERROTIN-Photo-Ringo-Cheung.jpg,Marty Schnapf,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/marty-schnapf/,"During a recent residency at the Xenia Creative Retreat in the United Kingdom, Schnapf, who grew up in rural Indiana but now lives and works in Los Angeles, began to consider how the places we inhabit survive in us long after we part and how, analogously, something of us remains in the places we leave. He began painting Forest Chimes, a pivotal piece that sets the tone for the exhibition. In this uncanny work, figuration and abstraction converge in undulating forms that evoke catharsis and wonder. We seem to have encountered a gatekeeper, the opening chorus to an exhibition that moves through wide-ranging vistas in a sweeping exploration of human perception and expression.If Forest Chimes is the entrance point, The First Moment of Sleep is quite literally the plunge. The threshold is crossed as a figure dives into water sending fish scattering in all directions. Water, a recurring motif in Schnapf’s oeuvre, is depicted as reflective, versatile in form, and metaphorical of the subconscious mind. The title of the piece also implies a certain freedom or release.Schnapf spent several years developing performance-based installations and events, and his investigations in these mediums, particularly dance, continue to inform his work today. Importantly, Schnapf regards his paintings as time-based works. Cognizant of the audience’s role in the activation of meaning, he builds multi-layered works that unfold slowly, rewarding prolonged viewing with ever-changing revelations. In this way, Schnapf’s paintings distinguish themselves from painted images. The Thresholds are not merely illustrated ideas. They are experienced passages discovered and crossed in the process of each work’s creation. Herein lies one of the secrets to the exhibition’s distinctly mercurial quality.Schnapf’s ongoing interest in the psychological resonance of abstract space is evident in his attention to compositional weight. In Sauna, for example, he harnesses the triangular arrangement of subjects to impart a sense of stability, while the downward motion of the embracing figures evokes feelings of vulnerability, protection, and warmth. The use of triangular compositions has art historical roots across cultures and can be seen as denoting spiritual hierarchy, solidity, and balance.Schnapf’s close relationship with dance and his extensive experience working with choreographers and DJs are evident in his gift for imbuing simple gestures with powerful emotional depth. His works transcend the aesthetics of grace and composure, probing deeper into the intricacies of the human psyche. In The Funambulist a raised protective arm echoes like a repeated thought in an orchestration of subtle color variations. This is counterbalanced by a lowered, receptive arm. The tightrope walker radiates strength as both shieldman and warrior, crouching in readiness and already taking his first step from one precipice toward another.Such overlapping perceptions indicate a borderless self and a multidimensional understanding of the world found throughout the exhibition. In Traveler, a figure traverses several settings, seasons, and temporal planes. She strides, resolutely present but surrounded by a constellation of living memories and imagined futures. Half Remembered Dream portrays a woman at once sleeping, sitting, rising, and floating against a surreal backdrop. We are privy to both her dream and its imperfect recollection.With Captain of the Ship, the Thresholds cycle returns to its beginnings. This painting is unique among the works in its portrayal of a child, the ultimate daydreamer. He stands on a pool float, about to jump into the water while the world around him shifts between manifold frames and viewpoints— windows into the varied narratives that transcend traditional boundaries of time and space.Collectively, the works in Thresholds depict intense energetic gateways that must be surpassed in order for desired reactions, phenomena, or conditions to manifest. Whether it be between different places, periods, or emotional states, the paintings signify this turning point.About the artistMarty Schnapf earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Wittenburg University in 1999, specializing in Painting, Printmaking, and Sculpture. His artistic realm conjures a fluctuating space marked by sensuality and psychological depth, where dreams, desires, and memories intertwine. Figures often overlap or are depicted in various choreographed positions, encapsulated within structurally fragmented environments that both envelop and intersect them. Through the dissolution and dislocation of these elements, Schnapf captures the dual aspects of a moment: its direct representation and its imagined or potential state.",Marty Schnapf: Thresholds,"3/F, 27 Huqiu Road, Huangpu District, 200002",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 31 May  - 6 Jul 2024
