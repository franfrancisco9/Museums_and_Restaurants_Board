His work has been exhibited since the 1970s and has been shown in England, Germany, France and the United States over the last two decades.Winstanley's work is represented in numerous public and private collections, including the collections of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, the Tate Gallery, UK, the New York City Public Library, New York, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.The art itself, not just landscape, is the real subject. This is another way in which its unexpected rediscovery in Winstanley's paintings gradually seems more fitting the longer one looks. What else these older paintings - made by artists from their own different cultural contexts - have in common is their curious relationship to the complex act of seeing. This was, in a sense, Winstanley's great project as a painter. His works have always taken as their subject the architecture and rhetoric of looking. Placement, perspective and colour - the tools with which illusionist Western painting builds its virtual realities - become for Winstanley a means of thinking about how painting and the world do or do not come together. The distance has always been there, but in these new works it is charged with a different kind of intensity.",Paul Winstanley: The Persistence of the Sublime,"Heilwigstrasse 64, 20249","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-2pm", 4 Oct 2023 - 1 Jun 2024
