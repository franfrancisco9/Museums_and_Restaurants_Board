For the realisation of this project, the artist responded to the architecture of the gallery space and in particular, its subterranean swimming pool manifesting in larger-than-life structures and sculpted mounds of playground sand set against a five metre topographical painting.About the artistNakayama’s works are a dialogue between objects in space as she explores the movement of stillness and its playful act. Using superimposed perspectives, her paintings explore the stillness of an object, its volume, and its environment. Each character has its own rhythm, claiming their relationships to one another. The objects are the pivoting points in which the shadows explore the crevices of its surroundings. They absorb and reflect like sound travelling between and within. Inviting the eyes to fluidly change in scale as one moves through and beyond.In 2008, Nakayama decided to move to New York to pursue her passion for the arts.

Ours has been a constant search for the grammar of life: methods by which we can extract sense from non-sense, decipher meaning from chaos, find vocabulary for the wisps we once resorted to calling ‘ghosts’. In its making visible the invisible, the act of excavation seeks to rescue the intelligible from the darkness of ignorance by reconstituting, piecemeal, fossilised memory. So begins the philosophical conundrum in which Hong Kong born artist Yi To prefigures the materiality of fragmented body, and its reappearance in the virtual as sign.What happens with the immense onslaught of time, its unerring passage? A document, artefact or vestige of life that endures erasure appeals to the unconscious vis a vis aesthetic sensibility before anything else. Like To’s work, that which issues from bygone eras hovers someplace between figuration and abstraction, and occasions a reading that relies, firstly, on intuition. From the presence of the golden spiral in the human ear, to the ability of an amoeboid organism to solve a maze, to the sophistication of the self-assembling flagellum, the wonderment in intuition is perhaps its intimation of intelligent design.To’s intervisuality is thus a holding-in-contradiction of both the spectacle of discovery and the withdrawal of nether worlds that cannot fully be known. Her paintings, with their shadowy forms rendered in thin washes, beget a fragility. They take on the propositional aspects of loss, an eclipse’s negative memory; as with the yet-to-be-discovered relic, what results is the invocation of a waiting. What of the total indifference of these subjects to the indefatigable curiosity of the present? What of the misapprehension of a cave painting that derails studies of early life for another thousand years?The fascination of To in working with the ambiguity of primary forms suggests we approach the mystery of the world as either encrypted, veiled, or an illusion requiring some kind of denudation. Her specific choice of overcast palette – be it soft Verdigris, greying mould, or healing bruise – confounds the interpreter’s authority to strip or lay bare. In Buddhist culture, depictions of young female corpses represent impermanence and the ephemeral nature of identity coherence: the contemplation of their splayed bodies has everything to do with denudation, deconstruction and dispersal. If To’s work is ‘a thought experiment turning the body inside out’, then the significance of this reference is in its anxiety-ridden becoming: from intellectually-bound life to its transformation into bone, gristle and, ultimately, effervescent sign. For the body transcended is precisely what permits its crossing realms human and non-human. Spanning time and space, To’s intervisuality comes to bear in another speculative gesture: a series of spindly sculptures suggestive of techno-syncretic fossils that, like interpretation, is capable of endless recombination given time.A thing of absurd misfortune is that interpretation is the essence of our study, yet at the same time unavoidably perverts it. This, To’s practice works with: achingly unanswerable questions, adumbrate shapes that may withstand temporal wearing, but are otherwise unable return to Earth as concrete form. In To’s work, it is therefore only absence that proposes itself, and must then lay in wait. Nothing to be done. So begins Samuel Beckett’s existential two-act deadlock Waiting for Godot, never so aptly summed as: ‘in which nothing happens. Twice.’Text by Elaine ML Tam","Yi To: To be dispersed, not to disappear","27 Warren Street, W1T 5NB","Wed-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 12-5pm", 31 May  - 6 Jul 2024

These paintings then go further to explore ‘Black’ not merely as a form of resistance, but as a material expression of existential persistence and do so with wisdom, wit, rage, humour, and generosity.The concept ‘Black Nausea’ is a term coined by the artist. Black–its associative bond animating the term nausea–creates an uneasiness that offers a transformative state, perhaps even a new trajectory for the lived experience. In the artist’s own words: “I came up with ‘Black Nausea’ after my experience of chemotherapy. It is an ongoing speculation and pillar. I’m thinking about the unease and discomfort of black… I think black nausea is a space for me to think, question, and speculate, there’s no right or wrong.” The painting Barren Cassareep evinces a sense of play echoed in numerous nuances present in BLCKGEEZER’s work. Barren, which connotes infertility, is a play on the word baron–a reference to the Caribbean cooking sauce comprised of black liquid. A key here is the connection between forms and materialities–all that is produced through contact–a sweat that is at once bodily, experiential, conceptual, and existential.Another conceptual neologism BLCKGEEZER has coined is ‘Breastistentialism’. Central to this work is aligning thought and imagination to question existence from a new perspective, one that is otherwise and ‘breast-centred’ and holds everything at stake. The proposition: black, breast, and blackness as abstraction that comes forward as a method and mode–a way of being in the world–to think other than the dominant and prescribed in a nuanced perspective.ABOUT THE ARTISTBLCKGEEZER aka Miya Jazmin Browne (b. 1997) is an artist born and based in London.

From this POV, it’s as if the ultimate paradigm of our individuality our face—has been stripped of any currency at all. But perhaps there’s something else of value in the anonymous swarm intelligence of a post-facial future?At ANNKA KULTYS GALLERY in London, Austrian artist Christiane Peschek presents The Girls Club, a suite of digitally-manipulated selfies that reflect the uncanny powers of a femme face that refuses recognition. Thirteen meticulously-crafted hand-dyed silk works mounted to aluminum frames are enshrined by a black vinyl wall installation that bears the phrase “The Girls Club”. The images, which are all characterised by deep-fried edits to a series of self-portraits taken on the artist’s iPhone, collapse the face into an abstract field of material data, one that can refuse the superstructures of capital and identity that augured it.“Using silk as a carrier for my images is a reference to the human skin,” Peschek explains in an interview. “Its fragile and delicate characteristic is a beautiful contrast to the hard surface of the touchscreen.” With a background in advertising, the artist has a keen understanding of material driven affect, even while her work takes aim at larger social, cultural, and technological systems that underpin the consumption of images online. With The Girls Club, an ongoing project since 2019, Peschek focuses on the eternal quest for self-presentation within virtual social environments. Drawing on photo editing and retouching tools, Peschek merges her own selfies with an ever-expanding archive of imagery culled from various social media feeds.Like many synthetic intelligence models including the generative adversarial networks (GANs) utilised to generate deepfakes—a digitally manipulated media that replaces one person with the likeness of another—Peschek’s girls are iterative, emerging from a source image that has been modified hundreds of times. The source image in question is the selfie; yet blurred beyond recognition, identity fractures and splits into multitudes.In Peschek’s hands, the selfie becomes less a projection of the self than an abstracted “internet gaze” and a critique of the algorithmic beauty systems that undergird it. Aesthetically, Peschek’s work is something of a paradox: the soft and gauzy imagery belies the aggressive bordering on obsessive treatment of the image, often spawned from pushing an editing tool to its extreme by reapplying it up to a hundred times. In this militant spiral, a popular blurring filter—typically used to conceal blemishes and other imperfections—first enhances the beauty of the face before annihilating it altogether in a wash of abstraction. Here faces are atmospheres, split into their melted composite parts. Mouths appear as gargantuan grimacing slashes: Cheshire cat-like, sinister. Eyes are always shut and often flattened. Very rarely does a baseball hat or some other accessory enter the scene. The rest of the face evades perception, becoming landscape.Enshrined by these digitally-rendered mutations and variations of the self, Peschek’s girls club is partially a series of self-portraits; equally depersonalised, the girl in question here is also all of us. This ideology echoes the argument of theorist Alex Quicho, whose essay “Everyone is a girl online” charts a new politics of “being girl”. Here, girl as collective consciousness (colloquially known as ‘girlswarm’) is both a recognition of the interlocking axes of power, desire, and capital laminated onto all of us (cis men, too, you’re also girls), and a polyvocal war cry for something beyond.Within her practice, Peschek talks about the phenomenon of “becoming image”—this notion follows Quicho’s girlstack, where one may sub for the techno-armageddon in order to collapse the system from inside it. Returning to Olsson’s peak face, the author suggests that perhaps “defacing” the world may be a chance to rescue ourselves from the financialized weapon suite of the facial platform. Likewise, with the infinitely expanding swarm intelligence of Peschek’s The Girls Club—flattened icons who evade their own humanness as much as they reject the financialisation of e-femininity—we see a similar spirit of refusal.“Soon, we might be able to look in the mirror and ask ourselves, earnestly, ‘Do we really need this?” Olsson proclaims his vision of a post-facial future. Peschek’s girls critically anticipate that mirror stage; these “supra-individual” portraits refuse the notion of the bounded self as much as they reject the genre of portraiture, ultimately delivering an exit strategy from the superstructures that got us here in the first place. To become unrecognizable is also to become ungovernable; to become girl, in Peschek’s distorted photographic image, is to become an edgeless swarm that critiques its confines while imagining worlds beyond representation.ARTIST INFORMATIONChristiane Peschek is an artist broadly interested in questions of identity and aesthetics online. Since 1996, she has maintained an archive of selfies that are directly utilised in her work and can be understood as the backbone of her creative practice. Spanning painting, printmaking, sculpture, and multisensory installation, Peschek’s practice skewers the historical weight of the portrait genre, subjecting it to the ebbs and flows of digital production, optimisation, and curation of the self as the ultimate currency. Drawing on digital retouching and editing tools, as well as the intimacy of the interface, Peschek’s practice critiques the fantasy of these online representations while also speculating on a world where the commercialisation of online identity can be eluded through the glitch and blur.Born in 1984, the artist studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. She has shown internationally at galleries and institutions such as ANNKA KULTYS GALLERY, Kunstmuseum Celle, the NRW Forum Düsseldorf, Museum MARTA, U10 Belgrade, UNSEEN Amsterdam, Salzburger Kunstverein and Benaki Museum Athens.Peschek was awarded with several international prices such as the UNSEEN Tesla Art Trail award, honor price of Emergentes DST and the state scholarship for photography by the Austrian Government.Her works are found in collections such as ING DiBa Art Collection, the Museum of Modern Art Salzburg, the Artothek at Belvedere21 Vienna and the Kupferstichkabinett Vienna.",Christiane Peschek: The Girls Club,"472 Hackney Road, Unit 9, E2 9EQ",Wed-Sat 12-6pm, 31 May  - 27 Jul 2024

Showcasing some of his iconic 1960s photographs, his impeccable fashion and advertising images, as well as powerful photo-essays documenting life in London, personal projects and nudes, this exhibition reveals an unexpected range of work from one of the foremost photographers of his generation.Exquisite and rare, signed life-time and vintage prints, unique 6x6cm contact prints and numbered silver gelatin estate prints are on display and available to collectors. A selection of rarely seen abstract black and white paintings inspired by Japanese calligraphy will be exhibited alongside his photographs for the first time.Born into a working class family in East London, Donovan was fascinated by photography and printmaking from an early age. His professional photographic life started at the age of 11 with an apprenticeship at the London School of Photo-Engraving. He left at 15 to become a photographer’s assistant before opening his own studio in 1959 at the age of 22. He was immediately sought after by a range of clients, including leading advertising agencies and fashion and lifestyle magazines of the time, including Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar and Elle (France).Part of a working class influx into the previously rarefied worlds of fashion, media and the arts, Donovan’s iconoclastic and sometimes irreverent photography established a new visual language rooted in the world he knew best – the streets of London’s East End. Taking his models to bomb-ravaged wastegrounds or balancing them off industrial building sites, his gritty and noir-ish style was more like reportage than fashion photography.In the 1970s Donovan concentrated more specifically on advertising photography and moving image work but the late 1980s and early 1990s marked a return to stills photography, revisiting black and white film, his preferred medium during the early years of his career.A selection of unique, vintage silver gelatin contact prints are also on display. These small photographs are made by laying the negative directly onto the surface of the light sensitive paper. Terence Donovan was known for meticulously reviewing his contact sheets, indicating his selected frames by piercing them with a pen or marking them with a chinagraph pencil. He discarded the contact prints of the frames he did not want used, keeping only those that he felt good enough to print or publish.These small, original contact prints of single frames (some more than sixty years old) were kept with his negatives and remain in his archive. They tell the story of their history, bearing crop marks, printing instructions or layout comments. As well as being beautiful objects in their own right, they present an important insight into Terence Donovan’s working process and provide information about which shots he felt were most successful from the many hundreds of thousands of photographs he took.Donovan was at the heart of a British fashion photography movement that exploded onto the scene in the 1960s. A unique set of nine vintage contact prints depicting fellow photographers and artists will also be on view. This exceptional series of nine prints captures major figures in British photographic history who were not only Donovan’s professional peers, but also close friends.This group of nine will premiere on our booth (G15) at Photo London (15 - 19th May 2024).Terence Donovan photographed many artists, models, singers and actors, from Jimi Hendrix, to Twiggy, to Cindy Crawford, to Stella Tennant. Gifted with an unerring eye for the iconic as well as the transformative, Donovan was a master of his craft, who pushed the limits of what was possible with a camera.In 1960, Terence Donovan was commissioned by Tom Wolsey, the renowned Art Director of ‘Man About Town’ magazine (subsequently ‘About Town’ and then ‘Town’) to do a photo-essay on an artist’s co-operative in the then run-down area of Notting Hill: The Lay About Life. This influential photo-essay exemplifies a lesser known aspect of Donovan’s oeuvre, away from the glamour and bright lights of the world of high fashion. It demonstrates his particular visual sensitivity and ability to empathise and immerse himself in other people’s lives.Despite his famously wide-ranging and diverse interests, Donovan’s passion for photography remained undiminished throughout his long career. Early in his career he told a young Jean Shrimpton:‘Photography fascinates me. Instant fascination every time. When the fascination leaves me, I’ll give it up.’In his later years, Donovan developed a love of painting and created vast abstract canvases, some of which are inspired by Japanese calligraphy. A selection are shown alongside his photographs at the Gallery.","Terence Donovan: Full Frame, Photographs & Paintings","49 Dorset Street, W1U 7NF","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 24 May  - 7 Sep 2024

Their strong graphical appearance and monochromatic colour pallet are informed by the artist’s experience as a self-proclaimed nomad. Here, the artist’s ability to bring storytelling into a modernist context is motivated by her travels and encounters. Indeed, the ebb and flow of her life is reflected in the often highly textured and layered works.Florian Baudrexel’s ongoing cardbirds series offers a similar approach. Embracing the formal language of modernism, the artist constructs sculptural forms from individual elements made from discarded cardboard packaging. The self-coloured works employ a strong geometric vocabulary, subverted by printed text or marks and wear from their former use. The play between found materials and the notion of ready-made and architectural forms unite to create engaging sculptures that suggest movement.Similarly, Beat Zoderer’s paintings are also constructed in a layered approach that articulates linear, wedge-like bars of colour that traverse over the picture plane; as one angular shape ends, the next reverses, either in a closely stacked zig-zag that pushes to the edge of the work or evolves at different angles, influenced solely by the artist’s inherent understanding of composition. Zoderer’s distinct colour pallet is loosely applied, resulting in opaque layers of colour. The works suggest a space that reflects an idiosyncratic painting approach, reflecting the artist’s interest in sculptural form.","Malene Birger, Florian Baudrexel and Beat Zoderer - A joint exhibition with Wellwood Gallery","7 Ledbury Mews North, Notting Hill, W11 2AF",By Appointment, 25 May  - 2 Jun 2024  
BEERS London,London,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/jack-kabangu-smiling-through-the-pain/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Jack Kabangu,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/jack-kabangu/,"Kabangu's debut London exhibition deals with primal, instinctual emotive concepts similar to how Kabangu's works are visceral, instinctual, and physical responses to his media. The young artist is interested in the balance of life; core philosophical ideas about how one is only capable of experiencing goodness in contrast with badness; dark with light; heaven versus hell, et cetera.The sentiment is one considered by a legion of great thinkers, including Nietzsche, who's existentialist views on life and creativity address the greatest of philosophical paradoxes. ""How can those who live in the light of the day possibly comprehend the depths of the night?” Nietzsche famously wrote in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. The book features a prophet relaying humankind's desire to create something superior to the limits of one's physicality.The desire to break free from constraints seems appropriate when speaking of Kabangu. It recalls the artist-as-tortured-genius, where the process of creation is one of struggles and rewards. ""Some of the hardest things in life are also the most rewarding,"" he states. “My mission is to find a balance between the ugly and the beautiful, the light and the dark. To create an energy that speaks to me. When I have captured this energy, the work is finished.”Kabangu's work does seem to tap into a prophetic feeling of immediacy and, perhaps, feelings of rage and joy. ""Smiling Through The Pain"" suggests this polarity.Here, Kabangu has created a sort of repeated narrative through his choice of imagery and motifs: hovering, disembodied, face-like forms – demarcated with broad and frenetic mark-making and bright colours – which seem based as much in the African tribal masks of his youth (Kabangu moved to Copenhagen at the age of nine), as they appear to subvert the derogatory ‘Jim Crow’ caricature of the 19th Century, or the latter era Golliwog stereotypes that were perpetuated in popular visual media into the 20th Century.And for Kabangu to appropriate such imagery and thereafter imbue it with his own identity suggests a powerful reclamation of a previously problematic and pejorative territory. But in this process the young artist creates a new sort of codex or semiological series of signs and symbols. There is, undoubtedly, a spirituality lurking behind these bold colours, wild brushstrokes, and whatever chemical reactions occur on Kabaungu's surface. The introduction of sand to these surfaces further suggests a darkness underneath - or, perhaps a desire to directly challenge viewers; they appear to ask us to reach into them to question their philosophical intent. Kabangu approaches these cryptograms and figures with an urgency that is at times lyrical, musical, fluid, or even aggressive.There is something enigmatic – despite their immediacy – in what Kabangu chooses to reveal or conceal. And from this technique is a brazenly confident repositioning of Kabangu’s (now trademark) reductive form – these nondescript orange eyes, these purple lips – as he owns the responsibility to remove these referents from a prejudicial and pejorative visual history into a newly empowered arena, where a young black man can create new modes of representation with a wry and empathetic sensibility, as well as the deft skill and confidence of a young master.We are thrilled to bring this powerful new body of work to our collectors and followers.",Jack Kabangu: Smiler Gennem Smerten (Smiling Through The Pain),"51 Little Britain, EC1A 7BH","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 18 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

Each serve as a powerful talisman, embodying the unique traits and character of its associated animal. As a continuation of their first collaboration, HunRod – known for its bold and exaggerated wearable designs – Lamy and Rodkin challenge stereotypes by creating what they coin as “finger armour”, redefining the conventional perception of delicate feminine jewellery.The Snake Ring, adorned with a single pear-shaped diamond, embodies the wit and humour associated with this intellectually driven creature. Energy and vibrancy radiates from the Monkey Ring, embellished with 61 white diamonds, reflecting the exuberance of those born in the Year of the Monkey. Finally, the Rabbit Ring, adorned with 105 white diamonds and one brown diamond, symbolises intelligence, responsibility and loyalty.The jewellery is complemented by the Rick Owens’ design pieces, an expression of his signature style of glamour with a provocative edge. The Plug Table Black Plywood (2011) channels Owens’ minimal aesthetic with its geometric shapes, clean lines and monochrome palette. Hustool Gold (2022), formulated from bronze patinated in polished gold, pays homage to Michèle Lamy with the title affectionately referring to her nickname ‘Hun.’ Other works on display include Large Plate (2016), constructed from bronze with an elegant and simplistic form; Bowl, which features a round shape, small triangle detail and polished surface; and the Candle Pillar (2007), a brutalist column that would make the ideal accompaniment to the dining table experience.Since launching their first collection in 2015 from Rodkin’s atelier in LA, the pair have yielded beguiling creations under the alias HunRod – a portmanteau of their names, Lamy, known as ‘Hun’, and Rodkin. With an ethos that views jewellery as an accessory that becomes an integral part of the wearer, the HunRod GOLD collection not only showcases the craftsmanship and artistry of Lamy and Rodkin but also embodies the transformative power of storytelling, making each piece a wearable and meaningful work of art.",Michèle Lamy & Loree Rodkin x Rick Owens: HUNROD GOLD,"79 Barlby Road, W10 6AZ","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 9 Feb  - 31 May 2024

Each designer articulates the vision of their commissioners, whether public or private, emanating their mastery from inception to completion.Originally crafted for Palais des Ministères, Chandigarh, Bureau des Ministres by Le Corbusier is an exceptionally rare piece of design history. The desk features a two-part removable top and an open corner supported by three legs. The smooth wood and angular design of the desk compliments the geometric shape of Serge Mouille’s Large Lamp Wall Lamp with 6 Rotating Arms – a unique wall lamp that was made by Serge Mouille for his studio in 1963 when he moved to Monthiers, France. The work is not just impressive for its scale, but it also features the artist’s signature kinetic sculptural aesthetic with its six rotatable arms, sensually curved shades and bent metal arms that balance fragility and size in harmonious union.MONUMENTAL also showcases a selection of previously unseen masterpieces, including Joaquim Tenreiro’s Credenza, Charlotte Perriand’s Conference Table, Sergio Rodrigues’ Bookcase and Michel Boyer’s Brasilia Chandelier.Joaquim Tenreiro’s Credenza (1959-65), a large-scale sideboard created from Pau Marfim, reveals Tenreiro’s mastery working in native woods through its exceptional diamond motif. Credenza showcases Tenreiro’s fusion of artistic aesthetics and practical design while also highlighting the artist’s mastery of craft within a modern and minimal aesthetic.Stretching to more than eight meters, Charlotte Perriand’s Conference Table (1947) is one of the artist’s most imposing works and a prime example of her design output during this period, which was defined by prestigious public commissions. Conference Table was created for the France-United States Memorial Hospital in Normandy, France and was later used as a model created for the Palais des Nations, the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The ingenuity of the design is exemplified by the perfectly proportioned aerodynamic lines.Brazilian designer Sergio Rodrigues’ Bookcase (1960s), which draws inspiration from indigenous cultures in Brazil, anchors his style towards more organic materials to show the possibilities of what can be achieved through wood. Michel Boyer’s Brasilia Chandelier (1974), conceived in the 1970s for the French Embassy in Brasilia, is iconic in design and features exceptional dimensions. Depicting a suspended boxy frame and lacquered white crisscross pattern, the chandelier was designed with four cylinders that play with the traditional notion of lighting structures.The exhibition extends outdoors into Ladbroke Hall’s garden, where visitors can experience Maison Démontable (1944) by Jean Prouvé. Originally designed in the 1940s as a response to post-war housing needs, the design was concentrated on rapid assembly, functionality and easily accessible materials. The Maison Démontable house showcases Prouvé’s pioneering approach to prefabrication and modular design. Following the exhibition, the work will be installed permanently as an outdoor Pavilion at Ladbroke Hall, a focal point of the new garden designed by acclaimed landscape gardener Luciano Giubbilei, opening to the public in mid-May in tandem with the exhibition.",Monumental: Tipping the Scales of Historical Design,"79 Barlby Road, W10 6AZ","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 16 May  - 22 Sep 2024

The artwork is similar to Shonibare’s Wind Sculptures series which reimagines that traditional notion of sculpture by utilising materials such as fibreglass and bronze to depict billowing fabric caught in the wind.Windy Chair takes on the paradoxical task of manifesting the invisible. We cannot see the wind around us, but its effects are evident throughout nature and the modern world. Shonibare skilfully creates the illusion of the dynamic movement of a piece of fabric caught in a gust of wind despite the artwork being crafted from weighty aluminium and steel. By evoking this illusion, the sculptures symbolise the fluidity and adaptability of human experience in an increasingly interconnected world. The surface of the work is populated with colourful and playful patterns, inspired by Dutch-wax fabric. The artwork reflects an innovative approach to contemporary design and fabrication, achieving remarkable energy and balance in a gravity-defying form.Shonibare uses Western art history and literature to explore contemporary culture and national identities. His work explores issues of race and class through the media of painting, sculpture, photography, and film.

Designers used this construction boom as an opportunity to experiment with new materials like metal and concrete, as well as to explore industrialised modes of production. These innovations were applied with the goal of improving the lives of the people interacting with them and the 6×6 house exemplifies Prouvé’s participation within this humanist design movement.The earlier models of Prouvé’s “demountable buildings,” including Maison Démountable, exemplify the initial stages of Prouvé’s soon-to-be revolutionary innovation in prefabricated housing. The structure is simple, Prouvé and his studio reduced the house to its most essential qualities and included his trademark “portal frame system”. The house is based on a 1-meter maquette and the design is a modular system, with a floor, wall panels with built-in door and windows, partitioning elements, and a roof. The structure was designed to be divided into three rooms, exhibiting Prouvé’s genius for efficiency.A restoration team worked on the house with a high level of care and attention to detail. All the renovations done were in keeping with the spirit of the original design. A two by six metre porch was installed, as well as doors to access it. New, airtight windows were installed to increase the isolation of the structure. The painting was restored to its original condition and underfloor heating was added to the restored original parquet floors. These restorations were all done to elevate the level of comfort of the structure, without changing its overall design or appearance.",Jean Prouvé: Maison Démountable,"79 Barlby Road, W10 6AZ","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 16 May 2024 - 16 May 2025

As with much of Trevelyan’s recent work, Fuse stems from a desire to broaden the scope of his practice by setting aside a brief-led design approach to draw inspiration from structured experimentation in both material and process such that uncertainty and unfamiliarity become integral to the creation of the work. Derived initially from a thought experiment involving the fusion of simple forms to create structure, the evolution of this series was informed by both wooden puzzles from childhood and the construction of simple maquettes in which pins were used to temporarily assemble larger structures. Translating the concept from maquette to large sculptural pieces in marble and bog oak required a meticulous design process involving precise sculpting of curved geometries to enable the forms to slot together and lock. As such, the aesthetic simplicity belies a technical complexity and the series exemplifies a blend of sculptural elegance with structural precision.The exhibition continues on the first level of the gallery with works from the Gyre series that meld digital fabrication with meticulous hand-sculpting and finishing. Trevelyan has previously worked largely in bronze – in contrast Gyre features works that are characterised by a spontaneous painterly approach to the expression of both form and colour in the finished works. Elegantly looped structures of 3D printed sand and resin undergo a process in which thickened pigmented epoxy is built up in multiple layers over many days to build a surface patina in which colour and texture are interlinked. Cutting back the final surface reveals a stratigraphy of hues from palettes unique to each work that are drawn from personal experience. The accompanying maquettes are selected from various stages of the process, illustrating the exploration of form, texture and colour that informs the development of the works.Despite their apparent differences in aesthetic and material, Gyre and Fuse share an underlying commonality in that both are assemblages of uniform morphologies. While Fuse merges simple pebble-like forms and Gyre consists of concentric hollow structures, both series explore the creation of structures in a manner that exhibits a coherence in their base sculptural language.",Charles Trevelyan: Vignettes,"79 Barlby Road, W10 6AZ","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 16 May  - 13 Jul 2024

A window or passage on the verge of opening, you enter and become fluid. A light flickers, there’s life within and beyond. Sucked in and spat back out into a world, familiar but not. Awoken to a glitching scene made apparent by the light that energises this reality we are now within. The control over your time and movements that you held moments before is no longer in grasp. Transfixed on the screen, time and space become redundant anchors passed this threshold. Boundless, you begin to float over the railings and through the constructed landscape. It’s surreal but familiar, mirroring domains and signposts of visions or places you’ve encountered before. All signifiers of the present have vanished and metamorphosis has begun. You can sense impressions of life are vibrating through the space, due to the confronting forms that seem to respire in an asthmatic way. The steel reflects and refracts almost returning itself back to it’s original fluid state pre manufacturing. Now that we too are scaleless, the fluidity of this cosmos spurs a perpetual motion that carries you through. Images melt into pure movement, morphing into a choreography of synthesis. The enigmatic forms provide speculative spaces that invite introspection as we fight to defend the dissolution of our present and drift further away from the space we occupied before. Details that seemed once important have evaporated under these new conditions, the gap you passed through is closing up. You look around for something familiar to latch onto and catch a hazy mirror projecting back your image, but you too have become a form, a movement, deduced to a spatter of molecules pulsating in the shadows. Elli Antoniou explores the multifaceted notion of ‘the virtual’ and the boundaries of sensory experience. She has devised a hybrid technique combining gestural drawing with the use of abrasive tools to subtly alter the surface of steel panels, transforming their reflective properties. Animated by their surrounding light, her metallic drawings propose scaleless fluid cosmoi in perpetual motion.Misusing power tools to draw, Antoniou’s process is physically demanding. Claiming co-authorship with her tools, she engages with them in a high speed choreography of synthesis. Her subtracting process allows forms to emerge at the surface of the steel sheet, referencing an ontology of fullness; in which the perceptible emerges from the imperceptible. Her drawings propose a world of possibilities with each glistening moment capturing a glitching experience of the present.Antoniou’s research takes the metaphysical as a starting point and weaves these narratives away from identifiable subjects, but rather a dynamic interplay of forces, transformations, tensions and tranquil states. Her narratives take the essence of the Baroque style, proposing an aesthetic of ‘texture’, where matter becomes subject matter; expressing the invisible elements acting upon it.Reflecting on the profound influence of screens within her contemporary perception of space and time, she focuses on their ability to simulate versions of reality beyond the spectrum of human perception through scale, distance or speed. As her sculptures continuously regenerate images under the play of light, they become speculative screens for an unfolding parallel reality, whose profile she is gradually shaping.Elli Antoniou (b.1995, Birmingham, U.K.) grew up in Athens and is currently based in London. She holds an MA in Sculpture from the Royal College of Art and a BA in Fine Art & History of Art from Goldsmiths University of London.

Her work immerses the viewer in a world of repeated imagery, signs, and symbols, a labyrinth of spaces and places, combining layers, forms, and elements. The artist blends dream-like visions and narratives that merge the every day with the ethereal. This is explored with pictorial tropes such as indoor scenes, plants, flowers, clouds, animals, and textiles, which are remembered, imagined, or inspired by researched source material.“Spaces and moods in my paintings have been influenced by the environment in which I grew up and the kind of places I feel to be important…spaces in [my] paintings are collages of metaphysical and psychological elements; they do not just reflect just one place or experience’’, Hellberg explains.Hellberg paints the space between memories and fantasies, heightened by her recurring use of intense colour throughout her works. Confident yet sensual brush strokes merge the foreground and background, highlighting areas rich in detail while allowing the works to appear flat and challenge our understanding of how we navigate the physical world. Employing these techniques, Hellberg builds a captivating and enchanting world.The settings depicted in Hellberg’s paintings are often interiors, such as rooms in a home, which act as a container for the elements within them. The works in this upcoming exhibition at Elizabeth Xi Bauer will include spaces between the interior and exterior—for example, the view of a house as seen from a garden looking in. Although an outdoor space, these gardens have still been designed and created by a person. Rather than linear, they operate across multiple levels of time as they are a mixture of real, remembered, and imaginary places. Hellberg’s works depict fictional spaces that interpret instances or objects that originate in reality. The artist omits human figures from her works and instead portrays objects and elements brought in or discarded by humankind. In Hellberg’s works, the ghosts of human presence remain. “I enjoy the recurring theme of aesthetic ghosts and labyrinths; my paintings are like chapters in a book of short stories”, explains Hellberg.Rather than guiding the viewer, Hellberg wants the audience to have their own understanding when encountering the work and to enjoy losing themselves within it. Whilst the references may be personal or from her research, Hellberg does not always desire to disclose her inspiration by not inflicting her interpretations on the viewer.Hellberg works on one painting at a time, turning other artworks around so she does not see them. The artist does not always finish a painting before deciding to work on another. This allows time to reflect and continue working on another canvas, returning to the other paintings later. This intense focus is reflected in her works.“It’s more like one thing leads to another; you can’t predict all the choices you’ll make in a painting, how you will feel about it or what you might need to solve in the painting”, Hellberg explains.This upcoming exhibition of new works by Karoliina Hellberg at Elizabeth Xi Bauer will include large canvases, smaller paintings, framed watercolours, and prints in a wallpaper format, the latter of which the artist has received a grant to create from Arts Promotion Centre Finland (Taike). These wallpaper prints will serve as an accent feature, exploring the motifs embedded within Hellberg’s works. The familiarity of wallpaper further layers and extends Hellberg’s depiction of domestic settings. This new wallpaper is similar to a project by Hellberg, commissioned by the Didrichsen Museum, upon her receiving the Pro Arte prize in 2018. This 2019 solo exhibition at the Didrichsen Museum was the first time Hellberg created and executed her wallpaper prints. The artist included new wallpaper prints in exhibitions at Galerie Anhava, Helsinki, Finland, and Galleri KANT, Copenhagen, Denmark.The exhibition will be curated by Maria do Carmo M.

In the years leading up to 80, I have spent more time reflecting on my life, and generally, what this thing called ‘life’ is all about, than in the creation of artworks. Nonetheless, I have been productive both ideologically and practically in the creation of new works. The range of artworks in this exhibition represent markers of my life as an artist, from my earliest works to my most recent. It is an insight into the evolution of my practice, informed by migration, my travels and the development of technology.My work is rooted in the traditions of pre-colonial Africa and ancient Egypt rather than the Greco Roman art of the West. Finding my calling as a visual artist late in life, I deliberately chose not to be trained in western art institutions as I felt that these institutions could not teach me what I needed to know. They were too deeply entrenched in their own traditions with little or no understanding, or interest in the things that interested me most: which are the ideas that lie behind the prized, yet often unacknowledged art, culture and influence of Africa.As an African, born in the Caribbean under British colonial rule, I was completely cut off from any knowledge of my ancestral home, and completely dominated by western culture; it was important to gain some understanding of my ancestral self. Art was the most accessible way of doing that. Africa and that which was deemed African were things labelled as dark and hidden, to be feared, avoided at all costs.I decided to become an artist whilst in Benin, Nigeria in the mid-1970s, as a touring musician. Whilst there, I believe I experienced a kind of fundamental transformation, or enlightenment. Inspired by the iconic bronze sculptures, I returned to London determined to acquire knowledge of the technique of sculpting, which I was able to find in books and through trial and error. The philosophical aspect came through a deep intuition and repeated journeys across various parts of Africa; Journeys that explored the spiritual side of my ancestral home; this was my art school, my higher education. The intuitive/spiritual aspect of reality still abounds on that Continent.The encounter between the African and the European has brought about deep-rooted spiritual and mental conflicts at the core of the African, along with the commonly held stereotype that the African is nothing more than: “the reflection of a primitive and barbarous mentality.” I believe that this point of view cannot be left unchallenged, and that art has an important role to play in the struggle to define and redefine a contemporary African worldview. He who defines “the story” is the one who controls, and so we are engaged in a struggle to define for ourselves, thereby becoming masters of our own destiny.In today’s African artists’ work we must: see the eyes and hands of the contemporary artist, looking anew, not at, but through the prism of an African aesthetic, speaking in a new world with the voices of the ancestors; voices for so long silenced; in doing so, their art will offer new generations the opportunity to look again with fresh eyes, to see themselves in new ways. The late Professor Stuart Hall wrote this for my inaugural solo exhibition in 1992; it is still relevant today, for me and for many artists of the African Diaspora.Fowokan George Kelly (March 2024)About Fowokan George KellyBorn in Kingston Jamaica in 1943, Fowokan migrated to the UK in 1957, attending secondary school in Brixton where, among his teachers, was Stuart Hall (the late Professor). He became a sculptor after working as a musician, playing with several bands, including Symande. Whilst working as Jimmy Cliff’s sound engineer on his first tour of Nigeria, Fowokan encountered the wealth of sculptures from Benin and Nok. Returning to London, he decided to give up music and taught himself sculpting techniques. As his work gained attention and the quality of his technique improved, he adopted the Yoruba name, ‘Fowokan’, meaning ‘one who works with his hands’. Fowokan has exhibited widely including in the iconic group exhibitions of Black British Artists of the 1980s and 1990s and in their important group exhibition held at the Guildhall Art Gallery in 2015. By Invitation, Fowokan became a member of the Society of Portrait Sculptors, exhibiting in their annual exhibitions, as well as that of annual summer exhibitions held at the Royal Academy. Among his international exhibitions are the Cuban Biennale and the Studio Museum Harlem. Fowokan's works are held in private and public collections in the UK, Europe and the US. Fowokan also expresses his creativity through poetry, prose, photography and videography. His writings have been published and vignettes of his video documentaries have been shown on BBC Breakfast with several on YouTube. His works have featured on television: BBC (Artsnight 2014 and When I came to Britain part 4: 2004) and Chanel 4 (The Empire Pays Back 2005).

Gagosian Open,London,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/nan-goldin-sisters-saints-sibyls/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Gagosian-Open.jpg,Nan Goldin,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/nan-goldin/,"Goldin begins her film Sisters, Saints, Sibyls (2004–22) with the myth of Saint Barbara, presenting the story of the early Christian martyr as a three-channel projection that echoes the triptych format of classical religious painting. Images of Saint Barbara accompany a voiceover that describes her defiance of her parents’ beliefs, a transgression for which they tortured her. This is analogous to the real subject of Goldin’s film and underpins its visual narrative.In 1958, Goldin’s elder sister, Barbara Holly Goldin, was sent to a psychiatric detention center at age twelve. She spent time in and out of such facilities for the next six years. Barbara was accused of “acting out, open defiance, sexually provocative behavior, association with undesirable friends, [and being] loud and coarse in speech.” Reports state that she went on dates with an older Black man, appeared to be confused about her sexual identity, and refused to shave her legs. Barbara stirred up a perfect storm of middle-class, midcentury fears around race, sexuality, and gender roles.Goldin was a witness to the physical and psychic abuse that Barbara suffered and that her family tried to conceal. Barbara’s death by suicide in 1965, at the age of eighteen, was a defining event in Goldin’s life, prompting her to rebel against and run away from her living situation at the time, and the remainder of Sisters, Saints, Sibyls describes how she found her tribe of fellow rebels. She shows us her own experience with addiction, confinement, and self-harm, and that with living comes not only maturity and change, but also loss and pain.For the site of the Gagosian Open presentation of Sisters, Saints, Sibyls, Goldin chose a deconsecrated church in Soho known as the Welsh chapel. The installation is a visceral, immersive environment, referencing nineteenth-century operating theaters. The piece was originally conceived in 2004, for the chapel of the Hôpital de la Salpêtrière, Paris. Salpêtrière was founded as an asylum in 1656 and was where Jean-Martin Charcot practiced his experiments on “hysteric” women. Goldin’s life’s work has always been about fighting stigma embedded in our society, addressing issues that include mental illness, addiction, and sexuality.This Will Not End Well is a retrospective focused on Goldin’s moving-image work, recently on view at Moderna Museet, Stockholm (2022–23), and Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2023–24), and traveling to the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin; Pirelli HangarBicocca, Milan; and Grand Palais, Paris, over the next two years.This fall, Gagosian will present an exhibition of Goldin’s work in New York.Nan Goldin was born in Washington, DC, in 1953. She lives and works in New York, Berlin, and Paris. Her work is represented in major public and private collections worldwide. Retrospectives include I’ll Be Your Mirror, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1996–97, traveled to Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Germany, 1997; Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, 1997; Fotomuseum Winterthur, Switzerland, 1997; Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna, 1998; and Národní galerie Praha, Prague, 1998); and Le Feu Follet, Centre Pompidou, Paris (2001, traveled as Devil’s Playground to Whitechapel Gallery, London, 2002; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, 2002; Fundação Serralves, Porto, Portugal, 2002; Castello di Rivoli Museo d’Arte Contemporanea, Turin, Italy, 2002–03; and Ujazdowski Castle Centre for Contemporary Art, Warsaw, 2003).

His work represents a continuation of what is known as the Hermannsburg School, a style pioneered by Rex Battarbee and Pareroultja's uncle, the great Albert Namatjira. Although, of course, each exponent of this style has their own visual lexicon, what unites almost all their work is a hybridity of one-point perspective European landscape painting, and the earthbound philosophy of the Arrernte. The resulting aesthetic is luminous and almost hallucinatory in its effect. Shadows are often painted as variations in colour rather than tone, adding to the descriptiveness of the pictures, revealing as it does aspects of the land that would otherwise remain obscure. There is consequently a heightened sense of one's surroundings, as though the artist's brush illuminates more than the naked eye can perceive.Pareroultja paints directly, without preliminary drawings or sketches. Consequently, forms are not always sharply defined, imbuing the paintings with a lucidity and dynamism that mimics the transient nature of the landscape itself. Mountain tops and horizon lines are angled off their axes, and the curve of branches are often accentuated, representational decisions that animate the land and underscore its vitality. A recurring motif is a group of trees in the foreground which, almost anthropomorphically, represent the viewer, or perhaps the artist himself. In a purely formal sense, they contextualise the scale of the landscapes Pareroultja depicts.""Weer Loo"" is what the artist's grandfather called the curlew, a large, ground-dwelling bird endemic to Australia. A field report from Brookton, Western Australia, once noted that their call was heard in response to the cry of possums shot by hunters (Hill, H.E. (1903), Some Notes from Brookton, W.A.). Pareroultja himself states that ""I hear the sound of the curlew at night on my Country, it's part of the Dreamtime story of my outstation, the birds make an unusual sound. They call each other together and celebrate and dance like a sacred ritual and it reminds me of the old Arrernte People who would dance ceremony, which may take the form of a corroboree. So, my London show is a celebration of my work.""This exhibition crystallises the cultural exchange that took place in the early 20th century between non-Indigenous and Indigenous People - ""... both ways..."" as Pareroultja states. Pain and injustice characterised much of this time in Australia's history, as indeed it still does in many respects, but this period also bore witness to great men and women of Aboriginal and European descent, working together and exchanging ideas. If there is something to be triumphant about from this time, and something that perhaps hints at a future of reconciliation, respect and progress, it is that, and the spirit of the Arrernte.",Weer Loo - The Cry Of The Curlew,"24 Howie Street, SW11 4AY",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 29 May  - 13 Jul 2024

Morris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/h-e-morris-2/,"In my arms the wailing philosopherThe final call of mad historyNow my presence is knownMy arrival marked by illuminated stainsThe great window of paradise openDown to radiant dust fall the curtainsPast Time In fly flocks of multicoloured birds—Gregory Corso, In the fleeting hand of time.One evening around 500 BCE the distinguished Greek poet Simonides of Ceos was abruptly called out of a feast, having been told that there were two visitors outside the banquet hall asking after him. Moments after he stepped away from the feast, the hall in which he was seated is said to have collapsed, flattening all who were still inside.When excavating the dining hall, he was challenged with the gruesome task of identifying the bodies of the other not-so-fortunate guests who had also attended the banquet that evening. Flattened beyond identification, he managed to recall the other guests in attendance by way of remembering the seating arrangements within the hall.This experience is accredited to the development of the “memory theatre”, a system of mnemonics commended by both the Greeks and the Romans and popularized right up until the renaissance period. This method of Loci uses the human mind as a temporal scaffold – mapping information onto the spatial to aid with memory impressions, improve recall and assist in the invention of ideas.In this regard the psyche is formed around a distinction between the matter of an experience and its form. As Freud reasons in his ‘iceberg’ diagram, consciousness has its head above sea level whilst the bulk of the iceberg, the unconscious, remains beneath, concealed.A similar fashioning of Freud’s iceberg analogy is apparent in the collection of works H.E Morris presents in her first solo exhibition in London at LBF Contemporary, Of Death and Visions. Signifying simultaneously both the closure of and the opportunity for experience, this juxtaposition is the starting point for Morris’ exploration of the unconscious. The paintings become Morris’s memory theatre and we, her audience, are invited to consume.The works included in this show feature abstract landscapes inspired by the land that Morris feels akin, her birthplace of Upstate New York. Morris’ painting practice broadly explores perhaps the only Greek concepts we are yet to destroy – love and death.Brush strokes sit atop the various surfaces utilised by Morris, exposing traces of the invisible hand of the artist and the submerged unconscious at work. The varying surfaces used – linen, canvas and locally sourced fabrics – all react differently when paint is applied, masterfully weaving the gestures from depths to surface.Into the Fold features three fabrics sewn together. A see-through mesh fabric gives the viewer a rare chance to see beneath the surface of the painting, whilst the cobalt blue segment is porous, allowing the oil paint to permeate its vibrant weave. The surfaces are chosen purposely by Morris to limit the editing process, allowing her unaltered unconscious to reign free.Other works in the show such as Diving into the Wreck feature a figure which becomes an event within the landscape. A celebration of ambiguity; the figure reflects the transcendence of time and space carefully manifested by Morris striking the searchlights of sign and meaning.This body of works, both raw and delicate, allow us to climb Morris’ temporal scaffold, providing us brief moments of insight into her memory theater.H.E. Morris makes maps of the world for us to situate ourselves within.

Nkanga fills indentations in these glass vials with scents or remedies, such as lavender (antioxidant, anti-anxiety), chamomile (anti-inflammatory, soothing), or St John’s Wort (anti-bacterial, anti-depressant), representing circulatory systems of materials that are harvested, traded and ingested – both on an individual and a global level.Other zones of respite in the exhibition include a carpet installation, coloured in deep red and purple tufts, based on the minerals pyrargyrite (from the Greek Pyr for fire and Argyros for silver) with the addition of actual samples of shungite (a carbon-rich metallic black stone, known to block electromagnetic radiation and purify water) and tourmaline (a crystalline gemstone valued by some for its detoxifying properties). New tapestry works by Nkanga employ a multilayered surface of fibrous layers, some incorporating figurative and evocative imagery, while there are also abstract and malleable levels to these complex textiles, allowing the uppermost black veils to be sculpted and shifted by the artist’s hand. Flame-licked ceramic towers made from stacked and striated columns of crackelured cylinders (produced for a major museum show in Spain last year) create tree trunk-like punctuations, each work accompanied by bowls of sustaining seeds, soil or materials proffered as ritualised gifts.Below this otherworldly landscape is a dark cavern of voices, a six-channel audio piece performed by the artist under the Pidgin Nigerian title, Wetin You Go Do (2020), asking ‘what are you going to do’? In this soundscape, Nkanga chants, sings and pronounces in six distinct voices and overlapping characters; some representing mother earth, others simulating extreme psychological states and one even caricaturing a spokesperson at a political rally.Combining poetry, sculpture, audio and performance, Nkanga has created a complex, fluctuating environment in which some elements appear to have been scorched by flames, while others are, by their very nature, reparative or restorative. This exhibition hints at the full range of her capacious practice, linking themes of global warming with personal self-care and the interconnectedness of all things.Otobong Nkanga will take on her first permanent UK commission for Art on the Underground at Nine Elms Underground station, to launch in 2025.",Otobong Nkanga: We Come from Fire and Return to Fire,"27 Bell Street, NW1 5BY",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm and by appointment, 24 May  - 3 Aug 2024

A coalescence of archival pigment prints, C-type prints, cylindrical magnets, folded pigment prints, found posters, galvanized metal, paper, spray and watercolour paint, these large-scale compositions, spanning ten by fifteen-foot panels, intricately incorporate magazine pages, photographs, drawings, vintage poster and other ephemera, both personal and unfamiliar. Pierson's meticulous process of addition and rearrangement of diverse components – either produced by Pierson himself or discovered during his travels – mirrors that of a collector; each material is afforded a prominent presence within the whole.Pierson is acclaimed for his evocative word-sculptures and installations created by re-appropriating commercial signage and large-scale vintage lettering. The first word sculpture in the exhibition is titled Peter Blake (2024), named after the leading English visual artist who, having created the design for multiple iconic musical records including The Beatles' 1967 album ‘Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band’ and the 2012 Brit Award statuette, became a key figure in the pop art movement. Pierson’s sculpture embodies the connection between the two artists – one which began in the 1960s when the young artist first encountered the work of Peter Blake distributed in the media. Years later, the artists would meet, with Blake inviting Pierson to visit his studio – an encounter that left a lasting impression on both. Blake himself was inspired to create a series of word sculptures bearing Pierson’s name: Appropriating Jack Pierson, Copying Jack Pierson and Borrowing from Jack Pierson (all 2002). While Pierson has been profoundly inspired by the work of Peter Blake – his own sculptural homage suggesting echoes of the playful and colourful arrangements of Blake’s work – this is the first time he has reciprocated this creative exchange by producing a word piece that directly references this history. Peter Blake also carries the legacy of the transformative period of cultural exchange between the UK and US in the 1960s, intertwining personal history with wider cultural influences. The exchange between Pierson and Blake serves as a testament to the power of artistic inspiration and collaboration, transcending time and distance to create connections within the ever-evolving landscape of contemporary art.The exhibition will also feature a floor sculpture, Everything you ever wanted (2012), comprised of a stack of letters, and a grid of drawings titled The Order of the Star (2015). alongside additional word sculptures such as Nostalgia, A Friend, You Are The Sun, Room For Angels, Thank You and Water (all 2024), the latter a chain of painted wooden and metal letters that tumble down as if cascading from their position on the gallery wall.",Jack Pierson,"67 Lisson Street, NW1 5DA",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm and by appointment, 24 May  - 3 Aug 2024  
Lychee One,London,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/qian-qian-portals-to-the-past/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Qian Qian,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/qian-qian/,"For Qian, art acts as a conduit for her creative world-building, probing the layers veiled beneath the exterior of phenomena. Her watercolours, celebrated for their delicate complexity, not only capture abstract sensations of luminous colours and swirls but also discern the nuanced bodily imageries. Expanding on last year’s dual solo at the gallery, which delved into quantum consciousness and meditative introspection, the latest watercolour works (highlighted by Finitude Unchained In Late Spring Blossoms and Immortal Beloved) seize ephemeral moments of spiritual communion between the human and non-human protagonists, or even the presence of consciousness unbound by the physical, manifesting directly within space and time (In a Greenhouse Somewhere).The visual core of these pieces draws from symbols endemic to the microcosms of electromagnetism and molecular biology, akin to micro-landscapes probing the harmony and chaos within this internal universe. Qian’s watercolour works summon the traditions of homo signorum medical illustrations, including the Inner Canon Diagrams, the Ashmole Manuscript, and even the whimsical fruit portraits by Giuseppe Arcimboldo. In contrast, her brand new oil paintings, such as the ‘Altar’ series seen in the show, resonate with the medieval concept of memento mori, a cornerstone in the tradition of still life.Another oil painting series, ‘Portraits’, adapts techniques previously explored in her watercolor works that vividly capture the essence of the microcosmic world, now used to depict human figures as negative spaces, thus challenging the Western tradition of portrait painting.Additionally, a sculptural installation piece titled Form and Emptiness brings to the forefront Qian’s recurring fascination with exoskeletal imagery, hinting at the enigmas inherent in classical still lifes – the deceptive nature of earthly existence and the ephemeral quality of material possessions.In essence, ‘Portals to The Past’ experiments with moments of transformed states of mind. In the artist’s own words, each painting functions as a portal, inviting viewers who resonate with the painterly visions to engage in spiritual metamorphoses. Through each portal provided by the paintings, we venture into the liminal zone of our consciousness, touching base with our subconscious, or even the sentience of non- human entities. Moreover, these works reflect the artist’s ongoing pursuit of deconstructing and reconstructing our sense of time and space across diverse epistemologies, from the annals of Western science to Asian and other non-Western philosophies.Text by Zian ChenARTIST BIOGRAPHYQian Qian (b.1990, China), graduated in 2018 from MFA Fine Art in Goldsmiths, University of London.

Her works are included in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Collection, Marcelle Joseph Collection, Michael Weissman Collection and other collections.“As a visual artist, poet and mother, I explore human spirituality and transcendence in the man- made technosphere and the wider natural world. Through paintings and interactive installations, I develop a narrative and aesthetic framework combining the two seemingly distinct spheres of mythology and science.I create contemporary paintings of “ecomythticism” that delve into themes of chaos and control, consciousness and subconsciousness, constructed memory and mindfulness, interconnectedness, oneness, and touch on subjects such as transhumanism and cultural hybridity. Within my artistic repertoire, I draw from a diverse array of motifs, ranging from microscopic cells and intricate plant anatomy to expansive macroscopic galaxies and ethereal nebula clouds. I seamlessly incorporate sentient living beings alongside abstract vortexes, atoms, precise geometric forms, and symbolic imagery. I endeavor to elaborate in my works the perpetual state of flux – the fluid transmigration from fixed forms and materiality into energy, vibration or information.Inspired by a fusion of esoteric historical works, with a particular emphasis on Zen Buddhism and alchemy, as well as modern philosophical concepts like Gaia theory, Roger Pensose’s quantum consciousness, Alan Watts’s Eastern philosophy, and Erik Davis’s insightful exploration of mysticism in the age of information presented in “TechGnosis,” I intricately develop a contemporary narrative that explores the realms of spiritual-material duality through my mythopoetic sci-fi imagery. By blending chaos and control, my works portray the tension between the ethereal and the tangible. ”—Qianqian",Qian Qian: Portals to The Past,"Unit 1, The Gransden, 39 Gransden Avenue, E8 3QA",Thu-Sat 12-6pm, 2 May  - 1 Jun 2024  
MAMOTH,London,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/suyi-xu/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Suyi Xu,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/suyi-xu/,"Through a visual language of organic shape and linear structure, Suyi Xu creates a dialogue between the built world and wonder in nature. Her paintings bridge inner and outer worlds. The devotional architecture of gates, cathedrals and cloisters holds intuitive, often mirrored, line and shade patterns of symmetry like butterflies or pine cones, shells or vulvas – references that run like a beam through the history of Western art and Eastern philosophies. Trained as an art historian at Barnard College in New York and then as a painter at the School of Visual Arts, Suyi’s research is deeply embedded in the tradition of painting. Her fascination with light is rooted in the transcendent brushstrokes of Rembrandt and the Dutch school as well as the visual vernacular of mystic painters orthe Color Field movement. Shape and form emerge from the picture plane, buttressed by pillars or skeletons of buildings. These elements are lifted from a variety of reference imagery often sourced from books held in large collections like Gemäldegalerie in Berlin or the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, institutions that are themselves fortresses of architecture and power. Raised as a strict atheist in Shanghai, Suyi is careful to suggest she does not adhere to any religious doctrine or institutional dogma, but that she is interested in what these have produced through the harnessing of belief, and how this manifests in a visual medium. The work of Proust, for example, is not about religion, rebirth and resurrection, yet his writing has that as its spine, she explains. For Suyi, the search is for a form of grace as described by Simone Weil – the grace present in a moment of awe and wonder on a rare spellbinding encounter with art, music or nature: the sacred encounter.Vaulted ceilings in muted hues, subtly glowing spheres and seductive patterns unfurl across immaculate linen canvases. The space rendered by Suyi echoes sacred geometry, as in The Room of Apparitions 2 (all works 2024) , where layered forms become mandalas or lotuses in the subjective eye of the beholder. In The Room of Columns arches become lids, lips or gems. Suyi’s washed-out palette gives a sense of the low-contrast, soft-focus, liminal state between dreaming and waking. The works are apparitions from the light of the mind’s eye. This collection could be, and even feels like, paintings that might be used as tools to assist in achieving transcendence. The artist sees them as her unconscious realms, and recognises her process as echoing the dreamer’s journey in an associative ‘dream-logic’ arrived at through a chance process. The images are subtle and calm: a reverent silence is embedded in the canvas, somehow an antidote to what she refers to as the chaos of New York.Suyi begins her day by intention-setting and mental preparation as she walks to her Brooklyn studio, seeking solace and solitude through the process of making. On arrival at the studio, she first sweeps the floor. In many cultures, sweeping is a physical gesture and a metaphor for cleaning the mental debris away, making space for contemplation or trance. The previous day she will have turned her canvases away from her to face the wall. This glimpse – or reveal – first thing in the morning is the time she values most in the day: when she sees the canvases anew. Once she has observed them, she then warms up – as one might at the start of a run or a dance – training her hand and eye by beginning some simple sketches of reference imagery from art and architecture. Dropping into a flow state and a meditative process means that as she starts back onher canvas and lets the white pencil glide across the primed linen, she is being guided by her focus and her hand rather than any pre-emptive composition.‘It is not pleasurable to forge your own drawings,’ she explains. As a result, this presence and responsiveness seem to keep the compositions alive. Her perfect ratio and balance is a natural by-product process, as she works through her ‘projected psyche’. Her unconscious walks her through room after room, like a dream in which there is a first-person traveller, and time and space are internal, only present when felt or observed. In this way, she creates a story-like lucidity, where the main character is either absent, or present in the body of the viewer.The body of work is distinctive in its rendering of soft, silent worlds in which the figure is absent and yet hinted at in bodily shape and form. In The Room of Coronation , the picture plane is foreground and background simultaneously. This interplay between spatial arrangements is also evident in The Room of Temperance , which – as with all balancing acts – is a mirror composition. At the centre the entrance also becomes a protrusion. Like Magic Eye pictures or optical illusion silhouettes, if you soften your gaze enough two images can be focused between. This trick-of-the-eye of perceptual state also echoes the in-between. Through her work, Suyi combines the formal harmony of expertly honed painterly work, with the appealing ability to invite us into her world.Text by Susanna Davies - Crook",Suyi Xu: Apparitions,"3 Endsleigh Street, WC1H 0DS",Wed-Sat 12-6pm, 17 May  - 22 Jun 2024

Her portraits capture moments of everyday life and an expanded female experience. Starkey reveals women in moments of private reflection or social interaction that might otherwise go unseen, the large scale of her images offering monumentality to these instances.“You are very aware as a young woman that you are the observed, and you are expected to perform for the eye”, Starkey comments, “we’re conditioned to the point where we observe ourselves being observed, and we operate out of that language, or those dynamics. My work is a way of speaking to women about how you don’t always need to perform for the gaze, that there is more to being female than being seen.” 1In her carefully choregraphed scenes, Starkey works intimately with the women she photographs, discussing composition and poses with the sitters, continually showing them the image to establish their approval of the work. This is to overcome what she terms “the camera’s consuming eye”, acknowledging the hierarchical potential inherent within the act of photographing someone. Untitled, January 2023 shows young women photographing each other; the work was taken during her collaboration with female students from Wakefield’s CAPA College, an initiative in which Starkey created a space of empathy and joy as a salve to the damage digital manipulation is inflicting on self-perception.These works stagger the viewer’s access to the women through Starkey’s use of glass and reflections. The subjects are shown through windows and mirrors, a process which forces the eye to slow down in its comprehension of the scene. She observed “I wanted to bring the female form to that state where it is fragmented and broken up... constructing the image so that it was harder to deconstruct, blocking the consuming eye”. 2 In the self-portraits, Starkey appears in the reflection of splintered mirrors, placing herself behind the gaze of the camera lens whilst equally becoming its subject. The act of turning the lens onto herself equally mimes the increasing prevalence and potence of self-representation spurred on by the relentless proliferation of images of ourselves within social media.Hannah Starkey (b. 1971, Belfast), lives and works in London.

His highly symbolic figures personify existential concerns, uncovering collective knowledge and visualising a return to the primal fact of existence. Whilst centred on the universal, his practice equally threads through a personal exploration of his own identity, using the naked body to connect viewers to his sense of vulnerability as a queer person. Correa Mejía presents these nude bodies as exuberant, spiritually harmonious beings that suppress notions of a singular identity and find empowerment in a universal connection to nature. Adopting a limited palette of ultramarine and red oil paint that is applied on jute, he summons the divine power of contrasting yet complimentary forces.“Living beings feel danger when they detect a nearby predator. They become still, they become invisible, and they hide their radiantly beautiful essence to protect their life. Humans are no longer considered animal predators, yet many in our species have become cruel predators that are afraid of allowing diversity to flourish organically between us.Painting is a ritual that allows me to connect to the wholeness of life. When painting I find calm in solitude, but I also find companionship in other living beings; the animal and vegetable. The elemental beings act as allies, extensions, and reflections of myself. They become symbols that help me navigate the path of life embracing existential questions about identity, gender, sexuality, loss, and grief that emerge. The new moon brings renovation, and femininity, and guides life’s rhythms. Flowers act as healers which help make us return to unity. Seeds appear as symbols for fertility whilst the feather signifies transformation and the freedom to fly beyond our skin.I identify queerness in the dolphin, a wise being of the water that returns to the surface to breathe, an action tied to gender fluidity and border diffusion. The armadillo is a symbol of the inner child being protected within me, shielding themselves with their armour. Butterflies emerge from their chrysalis and accept change with their wings open. These beings are watched over by the generous tree that gives air, shelter, and food.” – Daniel Correa Mejía, 2024.Daniel Correa Mejía (b. 1986, Medellín, Colombia) lives and works in Berlin and is represented by mor charpentier, Paris.

These images are further processed with the first mainstream 'black and white' filter on mobile photography, before being transferred on velvet and mounted on canvas, taking the form of photographic paintings. Within this framework, the artist uses repetition as an aesthetic and discursive device to examine the conditions whereby a picture becomes viral, the source of collective affect, or a symbol of obsolescence, questioning the neurosis of authenticity via successive procedures of copying, pasting, repeating – a machine of syntactic production, no longer tied to the logic of indexical image making.",Ana Viktoria Dzinic: Repetitive,"12A Vyner Street, E2 9DG",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 27 Mar  - 2 Jun 2024

Influenced by the writings of the Caribbean postcolonial theorist and poet, Édouard Glissant, she examines the complexities of cultural reinvention using motifs borrowed from nature. Her practice blurs the boundary between sculpture and performance – as evidenced by Woven Bodies, a hanging, wearable sculpture made from knotted and woven nylon cloth adorned with found objects. Moving between opacity and transparency, her choices of material suggest both resilience and nuanced fragility while weaving a rich web of intersectional storytelling. Weber’s first site-specific, public commission, Cycles of Unmasking, was displayed at Somerset House, in 2023, and her first museum solo show will open in Germany, at the Kunstmuseum Bochum, this June.The paintings of Matheus Marques Abu are influenced by his ancestry, spirituality and the daily lives of those of the African diaspora in Brazil. Focusing on the Atlantic Ocean as a site of memory, Marques Abu explores the interwoven colonial and Afro-Atlantic histories, by placing the sea, nature and the Ghanaian Adinkra ideograms as central figures within his work. Drawn to the Adinkra symbol, Sankofa, represented as a bird and translated as ‘go back and pick up’, Marques Abu sets white birds wheeling between youthful figures, iron railings and native plants afloat in a wash of green, white and blue brushstrokes.These elements form connecting links to the past while offering new pathways of interpretation for the future. Marques Abu’s expert manipulation of multiple narratives draws the viewer into a nostalgic realm where powerful dialogues between past, present and future become possible.Working mainly in photography and film allows artist Dafe Oboro to explore a multifaceted approach to storytelling. Drawing upon fashion motifs and popular culture, Oboro uses sound and imagery to contemplate questions of masculinity, movement across time and space and the socio-political state of contemporary Nigeria. Oboro aims to destabilize the often-reductive representation of Africa in mainstream media to provide a more nuanced engagement with cultural realities. The richly visual essay, Lagos Still Moves, captures mundane moments against the vibrant backdrop of the local scenery, while examining the sartorial traditions amongst which today’s Nigerians have grown up with. In the outstanding series Pour me Water, Pure Water, Oboro’s revelatory imagery frames moments of locals bathing on the streets after a long day’s work. These dynamic images of the everyday ritual of bathing underscore the essential privilege of access to running water. In 2022-23, Oboro was the winner of the Access ART X Prize by Art X Lagos, following which the artist completed a three-month residency at Gasworks, London.Emergent Energies includes photographic works by Gosette Lubondo, a rising star of contemporary African photography. Lubondo’s contemplative photographs explore memory, time and heritage. Her work is influenced by her great-uncle and her father, both renowned Congolese photographers. In her series Imaginary Trip and Land of Milk, Land of Honey, Lubondo shoots in old, abandoned buildings. In so doing, she reveals how these time-haunted places still retain vivid auras of the past. By repeatedly layering contemporary characters, including herself, within her scenes, Lubondo re-animates these emptied spaces and plays with the plasticity of time. Her composite creations shed light on the inner ‘soul’ of her selected sites, emphasising the disorienting discontinuities brought about by rapid changes in Congolese society. Here, where the mysterious past informs the present tense, Lubondo rekindles memories that invite the viewer to imagine new journeys while experiencing the emotions these atmospheric spaces evoke.Artist Eysau Telayneh creates captivating abstract paintings filled with his reflections on contemporary life in the vibrant cultural hub of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. By keenly observing his local environment, Telayneh uncovers behavioural patterns and rhythms which he transposes onto his canvases, remarking that this source of inspiration means he never stops absorbing visual stimuli. His passion for mathematics and physics adds further impetus to the colours and textures appearing in these paintings, which balance gestural strokes with geometric lines and forms to create dynamic compositions. Through the layered application of vibrant hues, Telayneh examines how colours articulate different emotions and interpretations across various cultures. Telayneh’s paintings reveal his fascination with colour as an inner expression of the exterior world, stating ‘creating art, for me, is about expressing colour.’Lastly, photographic works by Zana Masombuka - a.k.a. ‘Ndebele Superhero’ - a South African visual artist will be shown. Drawing inspiration from her upbringing in the small town of Siyabuswa, in rural KwaNdebele. Masombuka references Ali A. Mazrui’s statement that Africans need to interpret their history themselves and seek to re-invent Africa on their own terms. In her series entitled, 2009: Namba S’khambe, she explores the politics of a ‘seat at the table’ and how capitalism and inequity inform the dynamics of engagement for all institutional paradigms. The visual tones in the photographs are inspired by the YInMn blue colour, serendipitously discovered in 2009, by which Masombuka comments on power associations using the colour. Set against these layers, Masombuka uses Ndebele symbols of rebirth – the cutting of hair – to symbolise the preparation of the subject’s movement into an unknown space of existence, leaving behind projected ideas of what is, what is not, and, just as importantly, whatever lies in-between.",Emergent Energies,"24 Old Gloucester Street, Bloomsbury, WC1N 3AL",Tue-Sat 12.30pm-5.30pm, 30 May  - 29 Jun 2024  
Palmer,London,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/land-sea-air/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Carolina Aguirre,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/carolina-aguirre/,"Land, Sea, Air brings together a group of emerging artists whose work engages with ecology and the natural landscape. The selected artists are all interested in capturing the essence of our natural world, focusing on one (or any combination) of land, sea, and air. The title’s military connotations chime with the history of the Palmer Gallery building (once a factory in which parts for the Spitfire, Hurricanes and Lancaster Bombers were built during the Second World War), and alludes to the tensions between the natural and non-natural that are present in each of the artists’ work. Land, Sea, Air celebrates the natural abundance of our planet and examines the relationship between these fragile ecological systems and human life. Humanity is inextricably linked with the natural world, enmeshed in a complex system it falsely appears to have transcended. As our weather systems grow more erratic, and our climates more inhospitable, young artists of today are perhaps more aware of this brittle balance than any previous generation.Carolina Aguirre’s textured wood board works have a geological feel. She utilises the mineral sheen of Sumi ink, the sticky, bodily gloss of shellac (made from the female Lac beetle), the smokiness of charcoal and the chalkiness of Gofun (made from crushed up seashells) to create surfaces reminiscent of cave paintings. They have an elemental, ancient aesthetic emphasised by an earthy, rustic palette.Max Boyla’s swirling, gaseous, satin canvases have an ambiguous quality which drifts between pure abstraction and natural landscape, swinging between sea and sky. As a composite material made from natural and non-natural materials, satin is the perfect canvas to think about environmental balance. His work uses material to draw attention to the contrast between sustainable and unsustainable products, and how ‘green’ and ‘un-green’ living are so often woven together in our society.Shaan Bevan typically draws turbulent seascapes that are intended to mirror the internal state of her body when she was undergoing treatment for Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. She made one drawing for each level of the Beaufort scale, attempting to capture the power of the wind and equate that with a body in revolt. Shaan will present a large-scale iron work that has been periodically sprayed with water, causing it to oxidise and form a beautifully patinated surface.Sean Savage Ferrari utilises assemblage techniques to juxtapose found materials. His hybrid works are rooted in the earth and natural materials. During an artist residency in the Amazon rainforest, he began making works from seeds, soil, nuts and berries paired with found pieces of plastic (like discarded fishing nets). Here he uses wheat stems, which are dried, flattened, and combined to make tactile sheets. These are arranged on rough-textured paper made from pulped grass clippings and framed with wood from discarded pal- lets, forging a visual narrative of re-use and recycling.Throughout the exhibition the artists repeatedly challenge viewers’ perceptions of ecologies and the positioning of human beings within environments. Connie Harrison does this by rejecting the traditional rules of landscape painting, eschewing traditional perspective in favour of a prismatic approach to composition that blossoms from a central point in the canvas. Kavitha Balasingham’s sculptural installations take the form of flowers and butterflies, engaging the natural world. The organic forms are often 3D printed and have an electrical component, tapping into a tension between the organic and non-organic.Grace Woodcock’s predominately sculptural practice is rooted in the interwoven threads between biology and sci-fi. Wooden forms often make up the basis of the works, before fabric is stretched over them and solidified through layers of primer and oil paint. Fluid, natural forms twist and ripple, using a mixture of organic and synthetic materials to echo elements of the natural environment. Finally, Action Pyramid is a sound artist who records elements of the natural world. His most recent project saw him place hydrofoil microphones under the River Lea, live streaming the sound recording on- line. In Land, Sea, Air he will present an audio recording of underwater plants during the process of photosynthesis.","Land, Sea, Air","15 Hatton Street, NW8 8PL","Tue-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 12-5pm", 24 May  - 13 Jul 2024

For Fishing the World, as the title indicates, the artist remains true to her exploration of our planet. The exhibition showcases pieces from her latest series entitled Call Me Ishmael, taking its name from the opening sentence of Melville’s iconic novel Moby Dick. Imbued by the novel’s symbolism, biblical as well as fictional, the artist’s new body of work is rich in metaphors that softly slip into our imagination like a weaving.Before creating the series Call me Ishmael, Bouvier Ausländer crafted sculptural net-like structures, which serve as objects of their own as well as stencils for her paintings. For Call Me Ishmael, the artist places these grid-like sculptures onto various supports, such as maps, newspapers, tissue and Japanese paper, then sprays gouache paint over them to transfer a ghostly image, or shadow of the netting. These nets loom in variations in all the new works, resembling a moving grid that appears, fades and vanishes, similar to a fisherman’s net in the water.The sea setting and its symbolism in Melville’s novel are echoed in the recent series through the use of sprayed and diluted gouache in flowing and effusive compositions. Expressive lines and shapes capture the tumultuous atmosphere of Melville’s narrative. Rather than confining herself to the deep blue sea shade, the artist explores a spectrum of colours - pink, green, and yellow - sputtered, sprinkled and squirted onto the various media to mesmerising visual effects. As in the former series, fragments of the underlying maps or newspaper print occasionally peak through to offer yet another dimension in the work and its appreciation.The interplay of physical and psychological dimensions is central to Bouvier Ausländer’s research. The enlivened grid, or wafting net reshapes to a membrane that permeates between the image, its metaphors and our senses, between our inner and outer worlds. The narrator’s identity in Moby Dick remains elusive. Similarly, Bouvier Ausländer steps back from proposing how our planet is shaped. Instead, she invites us on a multisensory journey to fish for the complexities of our world.Sophie Bouvier Ausländer has held numerous solo and group shows in Switzerland, France and the UK. Her works entered important institutional collections such as the Musee d’Art de Pully and the Musée des Beaux-Arts du Locle.

The paintings in this exhibition mark a moving on, or rather a moving through, his painterly language with the inclusion of further materials; dried flowers, splintered wood and plant fronds, denoting a body of work that is unconsciously but undeniably, deeply rooted in the new surroundings of his Somerset studio in rural England, with connotations of the landscape seeping into and pouring over, each abundant and encrusted surface.A painter of intuition and spontaneity, Garwood has always gathered materials from the area in and around his studio to construct paintings. Originally based in London, the materials available consisted of scraps from local fabric shops, found metal objects, shoelaces, burger boxes and articles collected from the street, dipped, sprayed and slathered with paint. Painterly invention has always been fundamental to Garwood’s practice and has developed into a new, unsuspected pictural narrative for this exhibition.“When I’m making work, I’m not thinking about re-creating something I’ve seen or felt, I’m more interested in balancing colour or material but actually, these works feel like landscapes, or the feeling of a landscape at least. After I made the painting Sky Through Naked Trees, I was lying in bed looking out of the window and I saw my painting in the landscape, I had made when I was then seeing.”– Garwood, May 2024The paintings are constructed though unbeknownst observations and memories of discoveries in the landscape, through mists, downpours and blazing suns. Structures of raindrops on a windscreen may lead to splatters of glitter across heavily painted works, fronds of fabric seem to embody burly hillsides, and gusts of wind take on forms of flurries of splintered wood seemingly soaring across the canvas. Marks that look like possible animal tracks are scratched into abundant daubes of paint and north stars appear as collaged gemstones. And yet, these wildly abstract paintings refuse to settle into a form of representational landscape and instead continue Garwood’s expansive painterly practice, constantly investigating the ways that colours exist in relation to each other, the weight and capability of his materials and the transformative capabilities of painting “…. heightening the stakes of the dramas and tensions of painting - between physicality and levity, transparency and colour, control and surrender.”– Tomas Weber, 2022The outcome is something ethereal, a capturing of an energy that is hard to explain but seemingly familiar. They feel like they have always been in existence, familiar like the seasons. Garwood speaks about the cyclical nature of the countryside, the flailing of hedges for example only happening at certain times of year, leaving roads and paths scattered with shredded tree and hedge fragments. In these works, we see leaves, plant fronds, and splintered wood embedded, suggesting feelings of seasonality and perhaps temporality, which may be enhanced by the inclusion of old watch faces collaged into the works. They emerge somewhere between the foreground and background, sometimes identifiable and sometimes obliterated by heavy layers of paint, glitter and collage. Antique keys also appear, only to disappear again, dissolving into the canvas perhaps implying the repetition and history of a life and sense of home and belonging. Many of the materials are limited - either impossible to locate at certain times or in the case of the long grass fronds, simply not alive to harvest, making the paintings part of the landscape and seasons in the most fundamental way.“The materials are not available to me at any time of the year, I wouldn’t be able to even buy them at certain times which is quite amazing today. Whether it’s a plant or an antique object, I can’t always find it, this almost always gets me hunting for something new. In one painting I have used a beaded flower my daughter made and that’s a one-off too.”– Garwood, May 2024These are not paintings that can be resolved quickly, they brew and steep, submerge and are saturated. They weather and withstand, succumb and stick out. There is a vitality in the work that speaks to a very visceral part of our being. In the absence of literal depictions, Garwood takes us to a place of memory through association, by magic almost, only a sense of a place, a feeling remembered - we can feel the wind and the water and can smell the grass, the damp and the heady perfume of fresh pollen. Elemental in their nature, they highlight moments suspended in time, in a striking portrayal of what it means to be present in a landscape that deeply imprints itself into the body.The materials in the works are numerous; poppy seed heads, gemstones, glitter, net curtain, plastic toys to name a few. They appear across works on canvas, jute and glass (a back to front technique which has been a mainstay of Garwood’s practice for some time). As many associations and connotations the new collaged materials may have, Garwood is largely unencumbered by their references, deciding on their application and positioning simply based on how they develop the construction of a painting.Whether one chooses to seek meaning in the works or whether the paintings are viewed as pure abstraction, there has been a shift in ways of looking for Garwood and ways of absorbing his surroundings that are evident. The composting of materials and layers in the paintings continue to evidence his truthful vocabulary, oscillating freely between suggestions of place, collective experience, and association. The paintings are open enough to exist in other terms, although as Garwood says, “The grass does glitter with dew, and the wind does wrap you in leaves and sticks, it’s all around you”. In this exhibition, there are no obstacles between abstraction and association, improvisation, and control, only the endless exploration, transformative capabilities and potential possibilities of painting itself.",Tim Garwood: Loud It Up,"6 Camberwell Passage, SE5 0AX","Fri 10am-4pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 16 May  - 8 Jun 2024

The last master and first modern, Goya’s oeuvre spanned aristocratic portraits, Rococo styled tapestry cartoons, etchings and engravings detailing the trauma of war and satirical meditations on society. His painting Saturn Devouring his Son, dominates the poster designed to accompany this exhibition, A Painting Show.The life of a painter; the journey and transition from subject to subject, period to period, the ability to tackle all manner of subjects, reaching into deep, buried recesses of the human psyche. To dig in any direction with conviction and vigour, to move freely and to really sink one’s teeth into each subject. The leaps between subject and narrative should be fluid, multiple conversations ongoing, the space between the works, subject and manner of approach speak to the capacity of painting to accommodate endless change and the vitality of painting now.Two centuries on, Saturn Devouring His Son could not feel more relevant or timely. The painting reaches deep into the human psyche, our capacity for absolute, unthinkable violence.The transition and transformation to be found in Goya’s work is close to unthinkable. The intensity and power of The Black Paintings demonstrates the infinite possibility of paint, with any consideration of an audience an after thought.The exhibition is curated by PAINT TALK, a peer led curatorial platform founded by Mark Connolly in 2020.

It draws on persistent themes in Judge’s work: life, death, ritual and rebirth, creating parallels between the deconstructed body and the cosmos.Judge is preoccupied with physical and spiritual transformation - a body becoming ash, material becoming immaterial, the physical becoming metaphysical. The show revisits early elements of his practice, extends recent developments in his work, and opens up new areas of exploration. His work sets into motion dialogues between Western Modernism, Indian Neo Tantric painting, American Transcendental painting and familial funeral traditions drawn from rural Punjab.The 'Ghost Dance' of the title refers to a Native American ceremony. This type of circle dance was practised to raise the spirits of the dead in order for them to fight alongside the living to reclaim land from colonial settlers. Over recent years, Judge has developed a distinctive and innovative practice grounded in an extended exploration of pigmented plaster as an artistic medium. The plaster sets – freezing a record of its creation in time – the surface is worked, polished and slowly worn away to reveal layers of colour, texture and movement beneath. This process embraces chance, and over time he has pushed it further with each new work. The results are sensual and seductive, with surfaces appearing sleek and shimmering. They have an illusory quality, seeming to hover in front of the wall, suggesting depth, evoking the idea of a portal or doorway and inviting the viewer to stay with them in contemplation.For Matt’s Gallery, Judge will work at scale, developing a monumental, enveloping expanse of material, pigment and colour for the space and setting this into dialogue with new discreet, floor-based semi-figurative works redolent of funereal urns or totems. For The Sunday Painter, Judge will combine new works on a smaller scale with a like new cadaver-like sculpture devised for their space.A processional performance between the two spaces will take place on the opening night, recalling early performance works by the artist. The exhibition is accompanied by a new essay by writer and curator Susanna Davies-Crook, building on her previous text Spectres and Portals: The Work of Harminder Judge, produced for the artist’s debut solo show in India at Jhaveri Contemporary, Mumbai in 2023.As part of London Gallery Weekend, Judge will be in conversation with Davies-Crook on Saturday June 1st at Matt's Gallery to discuss the two-part exhibition. The talk will cover a spectrum of topics including belief, ritual, consciousness, material process, matter, and abstraction.

Throughout their careers, both regarded the impulse to paint as being intrinsic to their broader creative drive, an embodied painting informed by and informing their accomplishments as choreographers and performers.On view across the two spaces of our London gallery, these exhibitions consider for the first time the siblings as painters in parallel. Created in New York from the late-1970s into the 2000s, selected works by Geoffrey move from the quiet intimacy of domestic scenes to the lively energy of nightclubs. Equally tender and strong, these paintings display his deeply intuitive understanding of colour, used powerfully to describe emotion as much as form. Works by Boscoe are drawn principally from the 1990s, made in Trinidad where he resettled in 1970. A focus of these paintings, characterised by their quiet intensity, is the male nude, a significant aspect of Boscoe’s work though one that was rarely exhibited during his lifetime.Together the exhibitions draw connections and invite conversations around expression, representation and style, the similarities and contrasts of brothers who, sharing creative passions, remained distinct though equally compelling characters throughout their lives.New writing by Trinidad-born writer Attillah Springer accompanies the exhibitions.The Geoffrey Holder exhibition is presented in collaboration with James Fuentes and the Geoffrey Holder Estate.The Boscoe Holder exhibition is presented with thanks to Christian Holder, Executor of the Boscoe Holder Estate.About the artistsA painter, designer, dancer, choreographer and musician, Boscoe Holder (1921–2007) was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. A child prodigy, he began painting seriously and playing the piano professionally from a young age. He later formed his own dance company, the Boscoe Holder Dancers, and in 1947 visited New York for the first time, teaching dance at the prestigious Katherine Dunham School of Dance and exhibiting his paintings. Returning to Trinidad the following year, he married his leading dancer, Sheila Clarke. In 1950 they travelled to London, which was to become their home for the next twenty years. They formed the dance troupe Boscoe Holder and his Caribbean Dancers, performing at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Holder spent the next two decades touring Europe and further afield. Later in the 1950s he produced, choreographed and costumed shows at the Candlelight Room at The May Fair Hotel, where he also formed and led his own band. Film and television roles during this time included Sapphire and The Saint. He continued to paint throughout this period, exhibiting his work at venues including the Redfern Gallery, the Commonwealth Institute, the Royal Watercolour Society Galleries and the Leicester Galleries.Holder returned to Trinidad in 1970, where he focused on painting until his death in 2007. He showed regularly in Trinidad and throughout the Caribbean. In 1973, in recognition of his contribution to the Arts, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago awarded him the Hummingbird Medal (gold) and named a street after him. He also received awards for his achievements from the governments of Venezuela and France, as well as various institutions in the US. Posthumous presentations of his work include the group exhibitions: In the Company of Alice at Victoria Miro, London, UK, in 2010andSelf-Consciousness, curated by Hilton Als and Peter Doig, at VeneKlasen/Werner, Berlin, Germany, in 2010. A new book, Boscoe Holder: Travels in Rhythm, A life of art and dance by his son Christian Holder is published by Rosenstiels in spring this year.Geoffrey Holder (born 1930, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago; died 2014, New York, USA) was a painter, photographer, choreographer, director, costume designer, dancer, actor and composer. Following the lead of his older brother, Boscoe, Geoffrey made his debut appearance with the Boscoe Holder Dancers at the age of seven. In 1953, invited by choreographer Agnes de Mille, he relocated to New York City, where from 1955–1956 he performed as a principal dancer for the Metropolitan Opera Ballet before embarking on a career in film, which included roles in Doctor Dolittle and the Bond movie Live and Let Die, and later television. His first solo exhibition in New York was held in 1954. By 1956 his work as a painter was recognised with a Guggenheim Fellowship. In New York, Holder found a muse in his wife-to-be, the distinguished dancer, actress, and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade. The couple married in 1955, travelling the world – including a period spent in Paris working with Josephine Baker – eventually settling in Lower Manhattan. During the 1970s Holder won two Tony Awards for his direction and costume design for the Broadway musical The Wiz and received multiple awards for his direction, costume design, and choreography.Solo exhibitions have been held at venues including James Fuentes (2024: curated by Erica Moiah James, Los Angeles, USA; 2022: Pleasures of the Flesh, curated by Hilton Als, New York, USA); New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, USA; Mexican Cultural Institute, Washington, DC, USA; National Arts Club, New York, USA; Far Gallery, New York, USA; Griffin Gallery, New York, USA; and Randolph Gallery, Houston, USA, among others. His work has been featured in institutional group exhibitions at the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, USA; the California African American Museum, Los Angeles, USA; DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, USA; Nasher Museum of Art, Durham, USA; Museum of the City of New York, USA; National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, USA; and the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, USA, among others.

Split across the gallery’s upper and lower floors, taking the form of two distinct installations, Drift presents viewers with a spellbinding view of the visual rhythms that constitute the ebb and flow of various cityscapes. Through painting and photography; etching, silkscreen print and slide projection, Stawarska reveals how one fashions a personal relationship to place―layering histories of memory and movement, absence and restitution via patterns that wrap horizontally and vertically across the gallery walls.About the exhibitionDrift builds upon Stawarska’s signature artistic approach―of self-exploring cities, allowing herself to get lost, only to return―a practice akin to that of flaneur. Often accompanied on these journeys with discreet recording equipment; the recordings are adapted, shared with select listeners, annotated, and re-exposed to the world in multi-layered form, revealing the contradictions within the geo-politics of a given urban sphere. What exists in the interstices? This process of revelation is what Stawarska calls the act of “inner listening”.On the ground floor, Stawarska presents works that are largely inspired by the maritime hues, the abundant humidity, and air of a coastal city that evokes memories of an Andalucía. Here, dreams unfold as a horizontal line, in various shades of blue, green and lilac extends across the four walls of the gallery, punctuated by large paintings and small monochrome prints. A triptych, Found Boat, Lost Memory - New Iteration, 2024, hand painted over a silkscreen print, leans against the longest wall. Playing with scale and placement, Stawarska invites the viewer weave and observe from multiple sightlines as their eyes linger across long stretches of coloured paper to small, postcard-like images. Pause for breath, and look up, and one will find paper cascading from the ceiling to the floor―agile, robust, permanent.Speaking of Stawarska’s work, the artist, author and curator, Dr. Omar Kholeif, Senior Curator and Director of Collections, Sharjah Art Foundation, recently noted, “Everything that I know about paper I learned from Magda. I have spent years trailing in her footsteps―in print rooms and dark rooms, and back into print rooms through to installing onto gallery walls. What I have learned is that the paper presents a kind of boundless possibility―it listens, feels, responds, unlike any other medium”.An abandoned fishing boat, Some Boats Wait Forever 2024 sits in juxtaposition to the tiny photo-etchings of fishing baskets, which serve as both as vessels of confinement and protection.This play with multiple cityscapes continues downstairs. The film, which visually takes place in Łódź and sonically in Bologna and Pisa, revolves around a paired conversation with the painting of torn tarpaulin in Venice. This scene interleaves with a slide projection of shop carts and stalls, wrapped in fabric on a city street in Sharjah, UAE. Deploying her aforementioned process of ‘inner listening’.Stawarska invited local researcher and architect, Souraya Kreidieh, to examine a soundscape composition without detailed context, but for a series of prompts for annotations. These evocations are looped into slides forming a tapestry that tessellates and refracts as the clicking sound of the looping slide carousel, echo the call and response of two voices reading fragments of Gertrude Stein’s Ida, a restless traveller, who also enjoys the privilege of rest.Opening hours during London Gallery Weekend: 31 May and 1 June: 11pm - 6pm, 2 June: noon - 5pmMagda Stawarska (b. Poland, lives and works in Preston)Magda Stawarska’s multi-disciplinary practice combines moving image, sound, traditionally made silkscreen prints and paintings on paper. She examines how rhythms in sound affect our ability to decode the visual; how the process of what she describes as “inner listening” and intimate listening to a soundscape of place impacts the ability to understand one’s personal relationship to a city, and how the trauma of loss, passed from one generation to another, translates to the architecture within a city.Stawarska was recently the subject of a two-person exhibition, 'Plaited Time / Deep Water' along with Lubaina Himid, curated by Dr. Omar Kholeif at Sharjah Art Foundation (2023) travelling to MUDAM, Luxembourg in 2024. Stawarska’s recent group presentations include, 'A Fine Toothed Comb', curated by Himid, HOME, Manchester; 'Rewinding Internationalism', Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven and Villa Arson, Nice (2023); 'INVISIBLE NARRATIVES: New Conversations about Time and Place', Newlyn Art Gallery, Penzance, (2019), 4th International Biennale of Casablanca, Morocco (2018); 'Sounds Like Her' curated by Christine Eyene, New Art Exchange, Nottingham, York Art Gallery, York, and Gallery Oldham, Oldham (2017-2020).In 2020 'Bracka 40' was purchased by the Arts Council Art Collection. The work was included in exhibitions 'Right About Now' and 'Found Cities, Lost Objects; Women in the City', the latter was exhibited at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Southampton City Art Gallery and Leeds Art Gallery, (2022 - 2024).
