In her sculpture construction, the hammer serves as a vital tool, akin to a painter's brush. Anna Fasshauer shapes aluminium sheets with it, alternating between construction and destruction, resulting in a build-up and breakdown process. Hammers of different shapes and sizes are used based on the required force, with each blow stiffening the metal. The noise made in the metal workshop is inherent to the work process, an aspect captured by phonetically titled works. The show is a collaboration with Anna Fasshauer and Nagel Draxler Galerie.",Anna Fasshauer: It's a Boom Boom,"Avenue Louis-Ruchonnet 6, 1003","Tue-Fri 10am-6.30pm, Sat 11am-5.30pm", 16 May  - 29 Jun 2024
