Accompanying the exhibition is an Education Lab, developed in partnership with Chillida Leku and the NGO Menorca Preservation via its project Plastic Free Menorca.Eduardo Chillida (1924 – 2002) is one of the preeminent Spanish sculptors of the 20th century, whose varied and pioneering practice reinterpreted the dialectic of solid and void, positive and negative and interior and exterior space. Chillida’s connection with Menorca formed during the many summers he spent on the island from 1989. Setting up an outdoor studio at ‘Quatre Vents’, the family house he created with his wife Pilar Belzunce in Alcaufar, he found a quiet place to work on chamotte clay sculptures, surrounded by the fields and their dry-stone walls. At ‘Quatre Vents’, he also worked in a studio with a large window overlooking the sea, where he explored many of his ‘gravitations’.In Menorca, Chillida drew inspiration from the white light of the Mediterranean that was a perfect contrast to the ‘black light’ of his native Basque Country, as he described it. He held an enduring admiration for the light, the open-air quarries of local ‘marès’ stone and the monuments from the Talayotic period, including T-shaped ‘taules’ (‘tables’ in Catalan) which inspired some of his works and have been recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2023. He commented: ‘The light in Menorca is magnificent. The island has a beautiful history, there is a very interesting stone culture, and it’s so full of wind. So, I have heard it said: Menorca, wind and stones.’The exhibition opens with a series of large format ‘gravitations’, two-dimensional works on paper exploring the qualities and limitations of space. These delicate black and white works result from cutting various layers of paper, attaching them to threads and then suspending them to allow air to circulate between them. Alongside the ‘gravitations’ is ‘Mural G-56’ (1985), a large-scale mural which uses black graphic elements to draw from the same exploration between positive and negative space. In Chillida’s own words, ‘in most of my sculptures, the positives and negatives alternate. Each one is somehow reciprocal, the dissentient of the other’.‘Chillida in Menorca’ showcases a series of well-known steel sculptures and wood reliefs, emphasising Chillida’s interest in making space visible through the forms around it. Initially a student of architecture, Chillida explored concepts such as the limit, space and scale. In ‘Proyecto para un monumento’ (Project for a Monument)’ (1969), a play on scale linking to the artist’s many public monuments, interior space is shaped through three solid blocks that fit together. In other works, totemic elements of an intimate human scale continue to emphasise the interplay between solid forms and negative space.Throughout the exhibition, a selection of works are presented on plinths made from ‘marès’, the local stone used to build the 18th century building housing the gallery. The presentation concept has been developed by architect Luis Laplace, who led the restoration of Hauser & Wirth Menorca and the reconditioning at Chillida Leku – the museum created by Eduardo Chillida in his lifetime – and places the artworks in dialogue with the surrounding landscape and the architecture of the space.Alongside materiality, the act of making was a crucial concept in Chillida’s work. The hand was the artist’s closest subject and his most immediate tool to work graphically or sculpturally – it stood for everything handmade. Rejecting moulds, he embraced the irregular morphology of works created by the direct manipulation with his hands, such as the chamotte clay sculptures he worked on in his Menorca studio. These are presented alongside drawings featuring the hand, in which he found a living element to investigate space through the movement of the fingers, which open and close in an attempt to grasp their surroundings.In Menorca, Chillida modelled many of his ‘Lurra’ sculptures —a series named after the word ‘earth’ in Basque. They are made from chamotte clay, a type of clay which can be fired in large blocks without breaking. Chillida was attracted to this property of the material and explored the endless possibilities of shapes that it allowed for.In works such as ‘Lurra M-32 (Earth M-32)’ (1996), fine incisions reveal patterns of straight and circular shapes. In other pieces such as ‘Lurra M-13 (Earth M-13)’ (1995), the incisions would penetrate in such a way to reveal the interior space and impart a sensation of buoyancy. The titles link the works back to their place of origin: those with an ‘M’ in their title are among those made in the Menorca studio, while those with a ‘G’ were made in Grasse, in the south of France, where Chillida became acquainted with the material.Also made from chamotte clay are a series of ‘Óxidos (Oxides)’, which acquired a distinct colour and texture through the use of black copper oxide and the double firing process. As in ‘Mural G-56’, ‘Óxido G-78’ (1985) features abstract geometric motifs, which correlate with his abstract ink drawings and are painted on both sides of the work, inviting the viewer to experience the sense of space created with it.The final galleries in the exhibition foreground the artist’s passion for natural phenomena. He incorporated organic shapes in his early works on paper and steel sculptures and emphasised the natural qualities of the materials he worked with such as granite, alabaster and felt, amongst others. An example of this is the granite piece ‘Escuchando a la piedra III (Listening to the Stone III)’ (1996), in which the artist removed just enough material to reveal the form and emphasise the rock’s impenetrability. Similarly, exploring the versatility of steel, the sculpture ‘Lotura XXVII (Bond XXVII)’ (1992) is composed of longitudinal arms created in the forge, without moulds, and manipulated to open up and then wrap back into themselves, quietly inhabiting the space with a tree-like quality.Having grown up by the Atlantic Ocean, Chillida recalled spending hours contemplating the waves and referred to the sea as his teacher. ‘Homenaje a la mar IV’ (Homage to the Sea IV)’ (1998), from the series of tributes which Chillida dedicated to figures or phenomena that inspired him, evokes the rugged Cantabrian coastline through geometrical shapes hewn out of alabaster in contrast to an uncut stone base. In dialogue with this sculpture is ‘Homenaje a la arquitectura II (Homage to Architecture II)’ (2000), a reference to Chillida’s ongoing exploration of forms – whether organic or architectural – and their structuring in space.Placed in dialogue with the Mediterranean Sea is ‘Proyecto Peine del viento I (Comb of the Wind Project I)’ (1966). The study is part of the artist’s most important series of work, culminating with three colossal steel sculptures embedded in the rocks on the seashore of San Sebastián, a work which fuses materials, land, sea, and air. With its tentacular arms embracing the dynamism of the elements, the work is an invitation to look.",Chillida in Menorca,"Isla del Rey (Illa del Rei), Menorca, Balearic Islands,",Daily 10am-5pm, 11 May  - 27 Oct 2024  
Hauser & Wirth Menorca,Mahón,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/roni-horn-7/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Roni Horn,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/roni-horn/,"The acclaimed New York-based artist Roni Horn, awarded the Joan Miró Prize in 2013 and known for her conceptually oriented work in diverse media, presents her first solo exhibition in Menorca, featuring a selection of sculptures and installations that interact with the historical gallery spaces and natural surroundings. Although varied in medium, all works derive from longstanding themes that have propelled Horn’s ongoing poetic study on the protean nature of identity, meaning and perception. An ambitious installation of solid cast glass sculptures invites visitors to witness the interplay between light and weather in the South Galleries. Additionally, the exhibition features pieces inspired by the verses of Emily Dickinson and works in gold and copper from important series which the artist has worked on since the 1990s.At the heart of the exhibition lies ‘Untitled (“A witch is more lovely than thought in the mountain rain.”)’, a compelling collection of nine round sculptures made from solid cast glass. Horn started exploring and working on cast-glass sculptures in the mid-1990s, with a process consisting of pouring coloured molten glass into a mould, which gradually hardens over the course of several months. The resulting sculpture is highly textural: its sides are rough with the impression of the mould in which it was cast, while its fire-polished top is smooth and glossy, resembling a crystalline pool of water.Horn has said about the cast-glass sculptures, ‘what fascinates me has a lot to do with the essence of something that has one appearance but is really something completely different.’ The sculptures appear to be in a constant state of change, responding to nature through the skylights and windows and the presence of visitors in the architectural space. Gradations of sunlight and shadow activate the works, creating a dialogue between solidity and fluidity, opacity and transparency. In this way, Horn’s glass sculptures embody the heart of her practice: probing the relationship between mutability and place.Uncertainty and ambiguity permeate Horn’s work, evident in the seemingly watery surface of the cast-glass sculptures as well as in ‘Black Asphere’, a solid copper work which appears to the eye as a ball or ‘a sphere’. The term ‘asphere’ refers to the fact that it is not symmetrical in one axis. Horn has described the work as ‘a self-portrait’, linked to the artist’s experience of androgyny and resistance to binary labels.Duality serves as another thematic tool explored through Horn’s investigations of ambiguity and paradox, as seen in the ‘Pair Objects’ series in copper and stainless steel as well as ‘a.k.a’, which features paired portraits of the artist through time. In these, the pairing of potentially identical objects delves into the complexities of identity and unity, difference and duplication. In the Menorca exhibition, the pure gold sculpture ‘Double Mobius, v. 2’, presents two ribbons in the form of a Möbius strip, a geometrical form that appears to be two sided, but only has one side. The piece strips away the layers of cultural significance associated with gold and allows visitors to experience the actual material, in the shape of a strip denoting both intimacy and infinity.Literature plays an important role in Horn’s practice and the artist makes literary references both in work titles as well in the works themselves. Whereas the multi-part glass installation is titled ‘A witch is more lovely than thought in the mountain rain’ after a poem by Joan Murray, three sculptures from Horn’s ‘Key and Cue’ series feature the first lines of poems by Emily Dickinson, to whom Horn has dedicated various bodies of work.In the series ‘Key and Cue,’ Horn uses the verses as self-contained statements across the four faces of the bar, refusing to be seen or read all at once. In these pieces, Horn renders the text as images, encouraging us to think about language as sculpture, and hence removed from its meaning. As Horn said, ‘I don’t think of the object, the material thing or what is produced as the endpoint of a work. The aspiration is always the experience, which means the audience, the individual, is integral to the value of the work.’",Roni Horn,"Isla del Rey (Illa del Rei), Menorca, Balearic Islands,",Daily 10am-5pm, 11 May  - 27 Oct 2024
