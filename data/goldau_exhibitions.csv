His practice is concerned with his personal interaction and investigation with the natural world. Exploring the ways in which people choose to interact and represent place and spaces, while recognising and honoring the melancholy and poetics that characterize these ideals. His process resides within a profound interest in variations of documentation, forms of cyclical cycles, folklore, deep time and the act of foraging for natural materials.",Jacob Littlejohn,"Bernerh√∂he Nord 7, 6410","Mon-Tue by appointment, Wed-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 11am-3pm", 21 Jun  - 27 Jul 2024
