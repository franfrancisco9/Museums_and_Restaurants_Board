But that word seems uneasy, correct but subtly off. What sort of refinement is this, or elaboration, or even “study”— the anodyne quality of that word is deliberate. Kimmel is outside of fashion: not so much as a whisper of personal experience or life story, no appeal to identity, that skeleton key to all living myths and histories, omnipresent and deader than the Rev. Casuabon’s hopeless attempt to find the key to all mythology. But keeping within the conspectus of the Victorian novel, nothing is more perversely animated, more plastic with eldritch innovation, than what is dead: Dracula, Frankenstein, and a comically replete world of unquiet spirits. Kimmel would be uninterested in pursuing the Matisse idea of art, that beautiful armchair — but no one shirks Matisse, that’s just wrong and rude. But she doesn’t do that trip. Luxe, calme, et volupté — well Kimmel’s paintings have a luxurious quality, even a voluptuous one; but they’re very seldom calm.Kimmel works within a very well known history of postwar painting: Abstract Expressionism. And yet her paintings don’t look much or anything like those produced by First- and Second-generation Abstract Expressionists, the habitués of the Cedar Tavern, the gristle and sinew of the Tenth Street School. For such a stereotypically “masculine” and “tough guy” stratosphere, a lot of the guys underperform as *real men*. Jackson Pollock: a male hysteric with all manner of expressed of repressed and mockingly, amusingly displayed homoerotic “tendencies”. Franz Kline: adorable but likewise a patent mess. That these paragons of Action Painting and The Triumph of American Painting aren’t regular guys is hardly surprising. They’re self-created edifices of compromised, failed, hopeless masculinity if anything, but how vulgar to talk this way. The guys guys in this orchidaceous-hot realm were the women: Lee Krasner and Joan Mitchell, Elaine de Kooning and Grace Hartigan: they all unsex themselves after the manner of early radical feminist Lady Macbeth. Perhaps it’s fitting that among contemporary painters, certain women are their most vital descendants, keeping the shop of the forties and fifties open today and ever young: Julie Mehretu, Cecily Brown, Jacqueline Humphries, Laura Owens, and Kimmel; resisting the vulgar or maybe just way overdone and shopworn identity ideology of making and being. Unsexed. Not having it. Defiantly pissed off.An intense even overwhelming physicality bursts through many of Kimmel’s paintings. Again, love Matisse we really aren’t worthy—but that luxurious armchair or maybe wing chair overbearing and *powerful* to use that stupid word we admit we love. Waves of color, seismic ruptures, tectonic wrecks, tsunamis of pigment, dusts storms: so much weather and often inclement. But naufrage delivers even better sensation in art than paysage bourgeois and The World of Interiors. The Sublime:Both the Sublime and the Beautiful induce a state of submission that is often combined with the possibility of getting lost. They disorientate and undermine purpose. In one of several erotic sections in the Enquiry Burke describes the experience of looking at a beautiful woman’s body: it is, he writes, like a ‘deceitful maze, through which the unsteady eye glides giddily, without knowing where to fix, or whither it is carried.’— Edmund Burke, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and BeautifulAnd from the same:""Whatever is fitted in any sort to excite ideas of pain, and danger, that is to say, whatever is in any sort terrible, or is conversant about terrible objects, or operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a source of the sublime; that is, it is productive of the strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling....When danger or pain press too nearly, they are incapable of giving any delight, and are simply terrible; but at certain distances, and with certain modifications, they may be, and they are delightful, as we every day experience.""— David Rimanelli, art critic",Leelee Kimmel: The Wilds and the Shore,"361 Broadway, NY 10013",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 7 May  - 15 Jun 2024  
"Almine Rech, Tribeca",New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/thu-van-tran-in-spring-ghosts-return/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Thu-Van Tran,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/thu-van-tran/,"Forming the focal point of her exhibition In spring, ghosts return, Thu-Van Tran’s Colors of Grey evokes a world of intense paradox. Vivid hues enact their own negation, their multiplicity eclipsed through their mixing by the emergence of a gray singularity. Differentiation morphs into that which is almost indistinguishable. Begun in 2012 as a poetic reckoning with the so-called Rainbow Herbicides that the United States weaponized against Vietnam during Operation Ranch Hand, the series has taken many forms, from wall-sized frescos to monumental paintings. In her most recent expression, the artist explores expanded vistas on a more intimate scale. These works engage the legacies of Renaissance perspective, 19th- century panoramas, and Christian devotional painting only to subvert them through a meditation on landscape that unfurls across metaphoric and geographical registers.Arranged at the height of windows with a shared horizon line, the paintings in the exhibition offer a 360-degree view onto a compositionally and conceptually complex miasma of colorful abstraction. Their astounding beauty is rooted in horror. Indeed, the gestural washes that veil the canvas belie the steely logic of Tran’s politically encoded color theory. Between 1962 and 1971, the United States sprayed 19 million gallons of chemical weapons onto the jungles of Vietnam. Agent Orange was the most notorious, but Agents White, Blue, Pink, Green, and Purple were also unleashed in an act of chemical warfare that caused decades of ecological and human devastation. Limiting her palette to the colors used to identify these lethal herbicides, Tran paints each color alongside its opposite, gradually producing a shroud of gray pigment that floats above its originally colorful substrate. Her systematic approach results in a painterly negation that poetically figures the trauma of neocolonial occupation. This is a landscape twice abstracted. First, through the familiar gestural marks of nonobjective painting and, second, through the coda waiting to be deciphered in the very colors that Tran initially employs.The resulting panoramic installation that encircles the viewer formally echoes a system of visual representation popularized at the height of colonial expansion. Offering the public an immersive, even cinematic viewing experience, the panorama technique was patented in 1787 to instant acclaim. Visitors flocked to spectacles such as the “panorama du commerce” at the Bourse de Commerce in Paris, where seamlessly fused canvases hung in the round detailed scenes of colonial trade across the French empire. Commissioned to coincide with the Exposition Universelle of 1889, the panorama was a magnum opus of Orientalist painting. Allegories representing each country left no room for doubt as to the hierarchy of civilizations according to the French: Europe was represented as the arts and architecture, while Asia was reduced to elephants and a hookah.Conversely, Tran’s installation works against the panorama’s historical roots in imperialist expansion. Traditional panoramas borrowed a compositional style adopted from military protocols used to survey enemy land. They delivered scenes of heightened realism, typically from a bird’s-eye view. Tran immerses the viewer in a shifting landscape of suggestion and abstraction. Rather than indoctrinating viewers through an illusionistic palimpsest deployed to conceal violent conquest, the artist confronts the perpetual unfolding of imperialist aggression through the enigmatic commingling of color, form, and perception.In In spring, ghosts return, Tran introduces an additional structural element that mitigates the surveilling mode of observation courted in 19th-century panoramas. Interrupting the revolving pan of paintings are two triptychs, whose triple-paneled format borrows from Christian devotional painting. An altar is a threshold to divine mystery. In the Christian tradition, it illustrates the apotheosis toward which all other elements in the church, such as the stations of the cross, narratively progress. Its appearance here is a reminder of forces greater than the visible world and its conquest. This formal intercession in the rhythm of the panorama suggests space for contemplation. The panoramic effect, in turn, exerts reciprocal pressure on the altarpieces, confounding the notion of chronological time fundamental to the Christian worldview. Rather than an explicit narrative mapped onto an advancing timeline, the horizon line that laces across Tran’s panorama suggests a continual cycle akin to the Buddhist belief in reincarnation. In spring, ghosts return reminds us that everything circles back to a point of origin only to begin again.Tran’s incorporation of altars in the form of dual triptychs invites a spiritual dimension into what might otherwise stand as an exercise in history painting. As the exhibition title suggests, there are ghosts in this landscape. Apparitions coalesce and evanesce in the swirling veils of paint, pointing to mourning, mystery, and the possibility of communion. Tran has previously described her preoccupation with “the melancholy of a shifting landscape into which we must project and construct ourselves.” (1) For centuries, Western painting prized various perspectival systems developed in the Renaissance, whose power lay in the promise of projection. These systems relied on the metaphor of the window, placing the viewer in a fixed position relative to the scene before them. A window might provide a view, but Tran’s panorama invites us to choose our own perspective. In this haunted terrain, the act of seeing is also a radical act of reconstruction that forges a future through the vivid condensation of history in the present.— Katherine Rochester, PhD, art historian and curator(1) Hélène Guenin,“Interview: Thu-Van Tran and Hélène Guenin,” in Thu-Van Tran: Nous vivons dans l’éclat, ed.

Art Projects International,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/mari-lee-daily-discovery-of-present-moment/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Mari Lee,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/mari-lee/,"As Erik Bakke writes in his essay for the exhibition brochure Mari’s videos “might be 11, 19, 23, or 36 seconds long. They start in the midst of an action and end in the midst of the same action, or at a slightly different phase of that action — rain, or perhaps drops wind-blown from a tree, fall onto a puddle; water flows and ebbs over sand; a sunlit toilet paper roll’s end sheet flutters; a bit of icy slush slides on a shiny hard surface. Some of the videos are less like the others: falling snow and tangles of snow covered trees are filmed from a quickly moving vehicle.Liquid in motion and reflected light are recurrent themes. The action mostly takes place on a small, friendly scale — the changing light on a curtain or the shadow of a hand turning a pair of glasses and creating light play on a wall. Sound appears to be ambient, from the environment of the action. People’s voices and laughter can be heard in the background as the camera remains focused on the reflection of a building on the moving surface of white wine in a glass. But people are not directly filmed, and the closest the viewer gets to seeing characters is a small group of brightly colored tropical fish swimming back and forth in a contained environment–perhaps the denizens of a small aquarium tank.Mari’s title for the series, ‘Daily Discovery of Present Moment,’ suggests a practice and an approach. The videos themselves become less filmic aesthetic representations and more records of the ‘daily discovery’ — of the artist appreciating the changes in the visual manifestation of actions of the incidentally quotidian. The ‘present moment’ reflects a philosophical position that not only puts focus on the present but may only allow for the present. In considering A-theory of time (tensed time allowing for the past, present, and future) and B-theory of time (untensed time which is always described in the present tense), the viewer notes that Mari’s imagery more shows evolving and devolving states than cause and effect. Each video is a glimpse of an eternal present endlessly unfolding.Movement of water and other repetitive action at first lull the viewer, but then the complexity of the action in the videos begins to announce itself. As the viewer slows pace and heightens attention to better comprehend Mari’s documentation, they might be reminded that there are 64 moments in a finger snap. There might be a realization that the vital, vibrating life force of the world seems to be roiling just under the surface of these presentations of light and sound. The viewer may further understand that the reason for not paying attention to the mundane actions of the world is not because they are boring but because they contain too much information for a person to absorb — viewing becomes overwhelming, anxiety creeps in. But maybe, then, the function of these videos is not to slow time or lead the viewer either towards or away from existential despair, but for the viewer to take these briefly documented actions proposed by Mari as short rituals that allow for communication with deeper, unseen, uncomprehended forces. Present-1 shows, only through documentation of cast shadows, a hand agitating the surface of some water — the agitation becomes more pronounced as the video progresses. Here Mari explicates a deeper intention and reveals through allegory the rare ritual of the body reaching through the membrane of the real to negotiate with the spirits that invisibly surround us and control our world from just out of sight.”Mari Lee (b.

(Just what is it that makes this avant-gardist so different, so appealing?) This anniversary exhibition extends the inquiry by presenting 5 works by Francis Picabia, alongside 24 contemporary artists, each of whom have been inspired by Picabia in a variety of ways: As an almost limitless repertoire of formal and conceptual techniques; a satirist, parodist and avatar of play; a protean but self-deprecating spirit of myriad possibilities and potentials. If critics still often struggle to make sense of Picabia’s achievement, and only intermittently embrace its profuse permissive gifts, artists, on the other hand, have definitely always gotten the message, celebrated it, and enthusiastically extended it.

She embodies these dualities through a calculated foundational pattern – the strips, along with a much looser, almost freehand-woven image on its upper layer. The foundational layer serves as the bedrock, acting as a steadfast framework. The upper layer bursts forth with variation and negotiation, resulting in a mesmerizing, orderly, yet wildly free contrast. This construct carries myriad cultural and social weights, both ancient and contemporary. Whether it’s a set of landscapes, motifs, or an assemblage of color fields interrogating the stripes, the audience is invited to witness the dynamic dialogue in a realm of constant polarity and harmony.The title of the show, “Variation on a Theme of Blue and Gray,” directly references an ancient music form dating back to the thirteenth century. Composers like Bach, Beethoven, and Schubert used this specific music form to expand various ideas from a single motif. Through Zhang’s early education in classical piano, she views the weaving machine as an instrument itself. This inquiry explores the indeterminacy of weaving as a physical experience, juxtaposed with the regularity of machines. The weaving technique involves the coexistence of incompatible conceptual systems—domestic construction, celebrity culture, visual conspicuousness, or institutional critique—all of which are equally valid. The constraints and limits of weaving reflect this phenomenon within the picture plane, highlighting the sensual pleasure of polychromatic banded materials. The stripes draw attention through their prominence in our visual field and entertain the eye with their shifting patterns, combinations of color, and ocular effects.Through ongoing exploration, rehearsal, and performance of weaving, using notations and instructions of warp and weft, Zhang formalizes the distinction between personal intention and formalist theory in her artistic expression. The instrumental indeterminacy of the weaving machine is used to perform in situations where the boundaries of the machinery process are experienced as ambiguous, fluid, reconfigurable, or undefinable by the artist. Her new series of paintings translates such situations into tangible forms, demonstrating how shimmer, colors, textures, and patterns of the material are integral to creating subjectivity. If the motif of stripes is about turning the personal into possession, Zhang’s work paradoxically suggests transforming the material into the personal through the conduit of meaning as use, allowing us to abandon control in the process.– Yuan FucaMiranda Fengyuan Zhang has had solo shows at Capsule Shanghai, Shanghai; Mendes Wood DM, São Paulo/Brussels; Halsey McKay Gallery East Hampton; and Candice Madey Gallery, New York.

Halsey McKay Gallery,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/shaun-odell/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Halsey-McKay.jpeg,Shaun O’Dell,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/shaun-odell/,"During a Pleiades meteor shower in Northern California I saw a meteorite flying 300 feet in the air trailing flames like a slow crashing sopwith camel about to plummet into a meadow. In a flash it went out and fell to earth leaving a trail of gray smoke in the black freezing air. The shape of the meteorite's extinguished smoke trail is fixed in my mind. We couldn’t find the rock the next day but I assume it was composed of a good amount of iron.Iron is one of the elements undoubtedly known to the ancient world. It comes from supernovae, the earth’s core and crust and meteorites. While iron is the most abundant element on Earth, most of this iron is concentrated in the inner and outer cores. Before people mined iron ore from the ground all the raw iron used for smelting it into a molten malleable medium for making objects came from outer space as meteorites. Most of the meteorites that fall to earth are composed of iron. Beads from 3500 BC found in Gerzeh, Egypt and a dagger found in Tutankhamun’s tomb are both made of meteoric iron.In mythology the Macranthrope, an allegorical depiction of the universe as a giant anthropomorphic body, issues metals from its flesh and blood. Iron embryos rebirth the metals on earth and are forged by humans into objects of use. These objects carry within them the transformative power of their origin in the macranthropic cosmos. For a good part of the Iron Age iron was mainly used for weapons and the tools used to make those weapons but by the early 17th century in Europe and America wrought iron made up nearly every kind of agricultural, industrial, architectural, domestic and decorative human made object.In his early 19th century Newport, Kentucky mercantile my ancestor Henry Behrman was surrounded by the wrought iron objects of early America -  kettles, flat irons, pots, kitchen utensils, trammels, broilers, cranes, shovels, toasters, waffle-irons, trivets, bells, hooks, lamps, lanterns, candle and rushlight holders, chandeliers, latches, hinges, locks, bolts, chains, knockers, handles, hasps, balconies, braces, foot scrapers, andirons, fireplace accessories, weather-vanes, shutter-fasteners, scissors, irons, plough plates, wagon and coach wheels, axe-bars, round and square bars of all sizes, stoves, stove backs, mill gudgeons, nails, iron gates and fences, ornamental porch and balcony railings, mantels, attic window grilles, handrails and building hardware.In my work I am drawn to locating moments in history - my own, American, the west and human - when markable shifts from the mythos to the logos, the miraculous to the end of enchantment, the infinite to the reductionism of the quantifiable can be unfixed and made permeable.  Something like a picture - both on the wall and in my mind - that I can step into and out of.  In the painting, ((((Ore Macranthropic Echo)))) I wanted to see the origin of the smoking iron-laden meteorite I saw fall from the Pleiades emerge from the macranthrope in the Kentucky woods of Henry Behrman’s mercantile. Depicting and superimposing the moment I saw the macranthrope’s offering in 2009 California onto Henry’s colonial era Kentucky establishes a nexus point for my invented, ancestral, human, material and mythological memory. A site to contemplate the ways in which not seeing and disconnection from the miraculous have produced a dissociation from our relationship with the natural world and its undeniable presence.Reconstructing a mythological framework as a tool to confront both the dissociative and miraculous qualities of being eventually creates a sound in my paintings. This is how I understand they are activated and transmitting. Before I can hear the painting, the works individually and as a collective expand and contract formally. This process becomes one of disassembly and inversion. Some works maintain a consistent size and remain contained on one piece of paper during their creation. Other works are constructed using multiple panels of paper that are eventually unified by their mount on canvas, but through their making leave artifacts within other works. As paper is cut, redrawn, reordered, rotated, and reassembled events occur between paintings that direct their evolution and whether they appear as anomalies in single instances or as a visual language speaking through reoccurrences in multiple events. How to make a taxonomy of something as it occurs, but happened in the past and evolves to the future? Perspectival shifts through multiple picture planes enfold history into formality, representation into abstraction, fluid occurrences into fixed images. – Shaun O’DellShaun O’Dell (b. 1968, Beeville, TX) received a BA from the New College of California, San Francisco, in 2002 and an MFA from Stanford University in 2004.

Hauser & Wirth Wooster Street,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/roni-horn-6/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Roni Horn,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/roni-horn/,"Drawing has been integral to Horn’s oeuvre for nearly 40 years. Describing it as her ‘primary activity,’ she expands the language of mark-making by constructing, deconstructing and then reconstructing images and texts. A meditation on meaning, Horn’s unique process of taking things apart and putting them back together anew tests the limits of draftsmanship by exploring its sculptural potential. For her latest series, titled ‘Slarips’ (the word ‘spirals’ written in reverse), Horn began by making watercolor spirals in an array of hues. She then cut up the painted images and collaged them together into new tessellated compositions. Each is titled with a deliberate misspelling of the word ‘spirals,’ signaling a profound departure from the work’s original source material.Horn is an avid reader, and as much a writer as she is a visual artist. Words naturally permeate her practice. In this exhibition, her use of language pertains to the works’ titles, which act as entrance rather than explanation. Horn’s wordplay also figures in the sculptures on view: the titles of the six luminous cast-glass forms feature quotes from novels, films and radio broadcasts. These shallow tapered circular forms––a new shape in Horn’s ongoing glass works––are infused with a singular color drawn from a palette of whites, blacks and blues. As daylight pours in from the skylights, moving across the gallery and changing temperature over the course of the day, the saturation and transparency of the colors likewise shift. The subtle effects of varying light, combined with viewers’ movements in the room, activate these works, which defy any fixed reading.The artist began making cast-glass sculptures in the mid-1990s, pouring colored molten glass into molds that would then gradually anneal over the course of several months. Horn spent years developing a specific technical process that furnishes her finished works with a nearly alchemical quality: they appear simultaneously fluid and solid. Visually ambiguous, their opaque, roughly textured sides bear impressions of the molds in which they were cast, while their glossy, fire-polished tops recall the crystal-clear surface of an undisturbed pool of water. Water, often considered a universal symbol for change, is a constant theme for Horn, once stating she is ‘...fascinated by this idea of water as a form of perpetual relation, not so much a substance but a thing whose identity was based on its relation to other things.... Rather than an object, water becomes a metaphor for consciousness—of time, of physicality, of the human condition.’About the artistRoni Horn’s approach consistently generates uncertainty to thwart closure in her work. Important across her oeuvre is her longstanding interest to the protean nature of identity, meaning and perception, as well as the notion of doubling; issues which continue to propel Horn’s practice.This spring, Horn’s work will be presented in the following solo exhibitions: ‘Roni Horn.

On the surface – and what surfaces they are! – her works may seem to be about nature. They are perfect specimens of craft, that most human of phenomena, probed to its deepest root.”In her sculptures of botanical forms, Nielsen applies handmade glazes with an airbrush. Encased within the sheen of a gloss glaze overcoat, their lustrous surfaces hint at artifice and the decorative arts, enacting a metamorphosis: “A trivial thing is transformed into an icon for contemplation,” Adamson continues. A broad hosta leaf, for example, reads like a signboard with two sprays can blasts of red and yellow pigment; another leaf, its scale exaggerated, becomes an elliptical shield. A wall of plant specimens seems to sway, shift, and demarcate space as if runic letters in an ancient alphabet.Meanwhile, Nielsen’s three-dimensional sculptures capture intricate renditions of the small minutiae of nature: the slight rustle of a sprig of bamboo under a gust of air, the momentary claw-like gesture of a drooping chestnut branch, a rhododendron bush hammered by a downpour’s tattoo, or the tension drawn close to breaking of a bundle of twigs sutured by the gossamer of an overnight spiderweb. Regardless of its source—which often feels so familiar—Nielsen captures the moments in which nature asks us to look again, absent of the straightforward cultural readings of its forms. The symbolism of an oak tree, bamboo leaf, or chestnut branch is returned to their wilder engagements.In evoking the ephemeral forms and arrangements of overgrown spaces, Nielsen directs us to the still-life genre and its ability to crystalize the transient and fleeting. The artist isolates botanical scenarios and chance compositions from fields and forests through the slow and detailed observation of her surroundings. As Adamson writes, “This dynamic is exactly what’s at stake in Nielsen’s artifice. It is an elaboration of the simple idea that acts of looking are already transformative, and potentially destructive. She slows that process way down, almost to a dead stop, the better for us to feel its vast implications.”","Marianne Nielsen: Leaf, stem, twig","381 Broadway, NY 10013",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 3 May  - 15 Jun 2024

Ratcliff’s books include Lee Krasner: The Unacknowledged Equal (2020), Andy Warhol: Portraits (2007), Lynda Benglis: Soft Off (2002), and The Fate of a Gesture: Jackson Pollock and Postwar American Art (1996).Over the course of a seventy-year-long career, New York-based Argentine-American artist Raquel Rabinovich (b. 1929, Buenos Aires) has been concerned with the paradox of making the invisible visible. Her interest in mythology, existence, poetry, nature, and transcendence is reflected in her monochromatic paintings and drawings, as well as in her sculptural practice that encompasses large-scale glass environments and site-specific stone installations along the shores of the Hudson River. Exploring a range of material choices and artistic processes, Rabinovich’s work seeks to convey “that which is concealed emerging into view.”As a part of Rabinovich’s lifelong investigation into the “dark source,” the Avatars series allows her to represent the dark as neither negative nor absent, but as a rich realm of knowledge and wisdom. Each subsequent body of work continues that investigation while attempting to access the “concealed aspects of existence which lie behind the appearance of things, thoughts, language, and the world.”Rabinovich’s work has been featured in national and international exhibitions, such as at the Americas Society, New York; The Bronx Museum of the Arts, New York; Fundación Alón para las Artes, Buenos Aires; Jewish Museum, New York; MoMA P.S. 1, New York; and El Museo del Barrio, New York. Recent solo exhibitions include Archives of the Tympanum (a two-person exhibition) at the Hessel Museum, Bard College (2022), Raquel Rabinovich: Portals at Hutchinson Modern & Contemporary (2021), Raquel Rabinovich: The Reading Room at Vassar College (2018), Thresholds at the Y Gallery (2017), and Raquel Rabinovich: Excerpts at the Pratt Institute Libraries (2017). Her work is held in numerous private and public collections, such as The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museo de Arte Moderno de Buenos Aires; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Pérez Art Museum Miami; Philadelphia Museum of Art; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. She has been the recipient of numerous grants and fellowships, including the 2011-2012 Lee Krasner Award for Lifetime Achievement from The Pollock-Krasner Foundation.

"James Cohan, 52 Walker St",New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/jerrell-gibbs-language-of-tears/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Jerrell Gibbs,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/jerrell-gibbs/,"Jerrell Gibbs creates luminously rendered, expressionistic oil paintings that synthesize a wide range of art historical and cultural references to mine the elliptical contours of memory. His allegorical and autobiographical compositions explore themes of Black masculinity, fatherhood, legacy, and remembrance, complicating and subverting visual stereotypes and misrepresentations. Often working from archival family photographs, Gibbs creates tender, emotionally evocative vignettes that highlight moments of quiet joy and sorrow, rest, and mundane beauty while engaging deeply with the materiality of his process.The inspiration for the body of work in this exhibition came from the artist’s viewing of the 1977 Ralph Nelson film A Hero Ain’t Nothin’ but a Sandwich, which centers on the struggles of a young boy in South Central Los Angeles following the abandonment of his biological father. This film sparked a period of self-examination and painterly exploration for Gibbs, bringing to the surface his own experience of losing his father at a young age. For Gibbs, the canvas becomes a space within which he can parse the gaps and ruptures of personal memory to create works that provide portals into universal human emotional experiences.While the figures that populate Gibbs’ paintings are often drawn from personal life, he situates them within domestic interiors and fictive nonspaces that create cinematic moments of narrative ambiguity. Building up his surfaces in a process of accumulative brushstrokes, the artist imbues his scenes with a mixture of the familiar and the imaginative. Windows and mirrors frequently appear in his work, as both a metaphoric invocation of the variable experience of memory and a device to allow the artist to manipulate multidirectional light sources with painterly finesse. In My worst fear is…tragedy on news, 2024, a mirror’s reflection casts a familiar scene of family gathered on the couch in front of the television into a realm of slightly destabilizing distortion, suggesting the jarring impact of what might be unfolding before them in primetime.In this new body of work, Gibbs has begun experimenting with compositional disruptions that reinforce the psychological interiority of his figures. In Like father like son, 2024, a small canvas depicting the artist as a young child is affixed to a portrait of his father. Head bowed in profile as he listens to music on headphones, his beloved record collection surrounds him. This use of separate surfaces highlights the distance between the father who is gone and the son who has remained. Yet the color relationships across the two canvases suggest that, for the artist, music–like painting– can function as a bridge or point of connection across time and loss. In Inheritance, 2024, Gibbs depicts his father as a young man new to fatherhood and filled with its attendant joys, holding his infant son. A black void eclipses the child’s face. The artist notes, “This void is my own experience of the moment, which I only experience as a photograph.” The painting becomes a way to both pay intimate tribute to his father’s visible joy and to grapple with, on a broader level, what it means to build an identity as a father and a man when the memory of those who came before you is incomplete.What happens when the dream falls apart, 2024, and Two peas in a pod, 2024, introduce new physical material into the artist’s oeuvre. Gibbs limns these figures with flattened appliques of imitation gold leaf, transforming contemporary family portraits into 21st century icons that build upon the rich art historical tradition of illuminated divinity. The artist’s choice of imitation gold leaf is significant, functioning as a metaphor for the resourcefulness with which his family and his community in Baltimore have repeatedly built and rebuilt their lives with what little they had and were given.Jerrell Gibbs (b. 1988; Baltimore, Maryland) graduated with an MFA from the Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, in 2020. He has been the subject of solo exhibitions at Mariane Ibrahim, Chicago, and Paris; and featured in exhibitions at the Reginald F. Lewis Museum, Baltimore, and The Gallery at Howard University, Washington, D.C. His first solo museum exhibition, No Solace in the Shade, will be on view at the Brandywine Museum of Art from September 27, 2025, through March 1, 2026, following the institution’s recent acquisition of a landmark painting by Gibbs.

White predominates in her paintings, though like her inanimate subjects, it is given profound dimension through her explorations of its reflective intricacies. The overall effect Watt achieves is one of absent presence.The new paintings at the gallery emerge from Watt’s ongoing study of the eighteenth-century portraitist Allan Ramsay (1713–1784)—whose work is a frequent touchstone for Watt, alongside that of Francisco de Zurbarán (1598–1664) and Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780–1867). Here, Watt excises props represented in Ramsay’s portraits of influential and self-possessed women of the period. Feathers, for example, were common attributes in the portraits he made of the women he knew well, a resonance felt in Watt’s single-feather still lifes Praise (2023) and Finger (2023).“The still life can be very intimate,” Watt has said. “And because of its close connection to us, how we view it is continually being redefined. It continues to evolve because it reflects us. So, by its very nature, it is linked to the portrait. The still life is a portrait without likeness.”Peale, at Independent, takes its name from the nineteenth-century American artist Raphaelle Peale, whose Venus Rising from the Sea—A Deception (After the Bath) (c. 1822) features a sheet so hyperreal that one visitor to his studio tried to remove the drape protecting Venus, thinking that the painting lay behind it.Watt borrows the Venus sheet with closer fidelity than is usual for references in her work, though here there is nothing behind Peale’s cloth. It falls as the original does and embraces its central place in the composition. Like a ghost, it appears to hang on the wall through uncanny force, delineated from the surrounding white by subtle modulations of shadow.Rosanna McLaughlin has written in Frieze: “No material could ever form such perfectly suggestive shapes, of course, and the hallucinatory nature of Watt’s compositions draws parallels with the paintings of Georgia O’Keeffe, whose furrowed and swollen landscapes thrum with sex. If O’Keeffe’s paintings are intensely physical, Watt’s are discarnate, untouched by the messy heat of real bodies...”Watt’s work engages with art history on a deep level, borrowing her referents’ techniques and subjects without the kind of direct reference that might render her engagement with it more illustrative. There is a cinematic nature to her work, even though she paints props she has excised from traditional portraiture. The works seduce with their implied narratives of solitude and allow for personal or dramatic projection through the profundity of their mystery.The technique on display impresses, but at its base Watt’s work is conceptual. The amount of detail she lavishes on these still lifes offers its own elusive story. The objects she selects have vivacity and character. She is a poet of the voids in our lives, whose verses are written in objects of the everyday.Watt (b. 1965, Scotland) came to prominence early in her career when she won the prestigious annual award of the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 1987. Her work has been shown at the National Gallery, London, where she also served as artist in residence; Dulwich Picture Gallery, and British Museum, London; Scottish National Portrait Gallery, National Galleries of Scotland, Royal Scottish Academy, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh; and the Gallerie degli Uffizi, Florence. She was awarded an OBE in 2008 and became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2017.

Lincoln,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/nina-chanel-abney-and-jacolby-satterwhite/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Nina Chanel Abney,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/nina-chanel-abney/,"Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts is one of the world’s premiere performing arts organizations. On October 8, 2022, David Geffen Hall reopened as a welcoming cultural anchor for New York City, some 60 years after it was first inaugurated as the home of the New York Philharmonic. The new Hall reimagines the concert-going experience by providing more inclusive public spaces for diverse cultural performances and community uses. This initiative includes an annual program of art commissions, where all members of the public are invited to engage with the work of leading contemporary artists free of charge. The democratic approach instills a sense of welcome both indoors and out, beckoning those who may never have interacted with Lincoln Center or the New York Philharmonic, and encouraging those long familiar with the campus to see it afresh.Public Art Fund partnered with The Studio Museum in Harlem to advise Lincoln Center on the selection of artists for this first iteration of the art program. Two prominent sites were identified for the site-specific commissions: the 50-foot Hauser Digital Wall in the lobby, which Jacolby Satterwhite has animated with a richly layered and inclusive celebration of performance that brings into dialogue the past, present and future; and the Hall’s 65th Street façade, which Nina Chanel Abney has transformed into a captivating tribute to the vibrant history and culture of San Juan Hill. Both artists undertook extensive research to develop their works. They emerge as gifted visual storytellers, committed to a more inclusive understanding of the past while giving us all a sense of future potential at a moment of reopening and reinvention.The artworks are commissioned by Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in collaboration with The Studio Museum in Harlem and Public Art Fund.Nina Chanel Abney, San Juan HealNina Chanel Abney’s monumental work of art for the façade of David Geffen Hall pays homage to San Juan Hill. In the 1940s and 50s, this predominantly Black and Brown neighborhood was forcibly displaced to make way for redevelopment, including what would become Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Abney’s constellation of figures, words, shapes, and symbols reflects the thriving community that lived here. Featured residents include pioneering healthcare workers Edith Carter and Elizabeth Tyler. Also pictured are James P. Johnson, whose music gave rise to the Charleston dance craze, and Thelonious Monk, a pioneer of Bebop and other jazz styles. Reclaiming this important history in her bold and vibrant style, Abney aims to spark curiosity and inspire a more inclusive future.Jacolby Satterwhite, An Eclectic Dance to the Music of TimeJacolby Satterwhite’s commission for David Geffen Hall reconsiders the past, present, and future of Lincoln Center and the New York Philharmonic. An Eclectic Dance to the Music of Time weaves together archival images, live action footage, and digital animation. We see a colorful and densely layered festival of performance that traverses historical periods through virtual space. Satterwhite’s inclusive cast represents artists since the Philharmonic’s founding in 1842, while featuring young musicians and dancers from across New York City. They play instruments and dance on stages and sculptural monuments set into a landscape inspired by Central Park and surrounded by buildings covered in screens, reminiscent of Times Square. Grounded in a more democratic view of history, Satterwhite’s work offers us his playful and richly inventive vision of a creatively empowered future.Nina Chanel Abney is known for combining representation and abstraction. Her paintings capture the frenetic pace of contemporary culture. Broaching subjects as diverse as race, celebrity, religion, politics, sex, and art history, her works eschew linear storytelling in lieu of disjointed narratives. The effect is information overload, balanced with a kind of spontaneous order, where time and space are compressed and identity is interchangeable. Her distinctively bold style harnesses the flux and simultaneity that have come to define life in the 21st century. Through a bracing use of color and unapologetic scale, Abney’s canvases propose a new type of history painting, one grounded in the barrage of everyday events and funneled through the velocity of the internet.Abney’s work is included in collections around the world, including the Brooklyn Museum, The Rubell Family Collection, Bronx Museum, and the Burger Collection, Hong Kong. Her first solo museum exhibition, Nina Chanel Abney: Royal Flush, curated by Marshall Price, was presented in 2017 at the Nasher Museum of Art, North Carolina. It traveled to the Chicago Cultural Center and then to Los Angeles, where it was jointly presented by the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the California African American Museum. The final venue for the exhibition was the Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase College, State University of New York.Jacolby Satterwhite is celebrated for a conceptual practice addressing crucial themes of labor, consumption, carnality, and fantasy through immersive installation, virtual reality, and digital media. He uses a range of software to produce intricately detailed animations and live action film of real and imagined worlds populated by the avatars of artists and friends. These animations serve as the stage on which the artist synthesizes the multiple disciplines that encompass his practice, namely painting, performance, illustration, sculpture, photography, and writing. Satterwhite draws from an extensive set of references, guided by queer theory, modernism, and video game language to challenge conventions of Western art through a personal and political lens. An equally significant influence is that of his late mother, Patricia Satterwhite, whose ethereal vocals and diagrams for visionary household products serve as the source material within a decidedly complex structure of memory and mythology. Satterwhite received his BFA from the Maryland Institute College of Arts, Baltimore and his MFA from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. His work has been presented in numerous exhibitions and festivals internationally, including most recently at Haus der Kunst, Munich,2021; Gwangju Biennale, Gwangju,(2021; and Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, OH, 2021.Nina Chanel AbneySan Juan Heal, 2022Latex ink and vinyl mounted on glassCommissioned by Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in collaboration with The Studio Museum in Harlem and Public Art FundPhoto: Nicholas Knight, courtesy Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, The Studio Museum in Harlem, and Public Art Fund, NY.Jacolby SatterwhiteAn Eclectic Dance to the Music of Time, 2022HD color video and 3D animation27:23 minsCommissioned by Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in collaboration with The Studio Museum in Harlem and Public Art Fund© Jacolby Satterwhite.

Luhring Augustine Tribeca,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/tomm-el-saieh-and-diego-singh-flaming-mirror/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Tomm El-Saieh,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/tomm-el-saieh/,"Text by Stephanie Seidel, Monica and Blake Grossman Curator, Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami:A few years ago, seemingly out of nowhere, objects like café chairs and bike saddles suddenly burst into flames in the streets near a London high-rise. It was the “Walkie Talkie” building’s concave, mirrored façade reflecting the sun so intensely, even on cloudy days, that it created extremely powerful rays of heat. Acting like a burning mirror, the building’s surface concentrated light into the more palpable element of fire. The intangible optical started to forcefully affect the tactile environment.The title of Tomm El-Saieh’s and Diego Singh’s two-person exhibition, Flaming Mirror, evokes an image similar to this burning mirror effect. Five paintings by each artist, all developed over the last two years, face each other. The work’s rhythmic and chromatic surfaces appear to bounce off each other, like sounding boards or infinity mirrors exposed to their echoes and resonances, with the viewer located in the space between. While the works are not exact juxtapositions of each other, they certainly convey that the two artists have known each other for almost twenty years, working side by side, including together operating an artist-run gallery in Miami Beach, CENTRAL FINE.El-Saieh’s and Singh’s works both explore connections between chromatic and tactile qualities in abstraction, approached, however, from vastly different angles. Accordingly, “flaming mirror” is not just a metaphor for the spatial dynamic apparent in the exhibition, but also reflects the two artist’s physical and metaphorical handling of color within their respective works. Color does not just circumscribe the chromatic, “(it) is the name given to forces that allow us to confront the uneasy task of marking difference,” as artist Amy Sillman writes.[1]Informed by the rich history of Haitian painting, yet bypassing its largely figurative tradition, El-Saieh combines washed-out, watercolor-like planes with dense and rhythmic patterns of dry-rubbed paint. This lattice of marks may appear to viewers like maps or grids, or act like Rorschach tests. The various layers of paint appear to operate at different speeds; the velocity of the poured, cloud-like paint of the background, contrasts with the laborious brushstrokes on the surface, inscriptions that appear meticulously chiseled.On the other hand, Singh’s handling of paint erases its own traces of application. Oil and acrylic paint — poured and brushed in various ways — create obscured layers to the point of becoming impenetrable. Figure and ground meld into one colorful surface, wrapped in meshes of yellow, green, and red. Testing the legacies of modernism and the boundaries of language, Singh’s paintings explore the ways that abstraction and vibrancy relate to representations of queerness. In Singh’s work color appears at times dense and sticky, at others lucid and luminous; lines, fine like hair, run through the paintings, and then –– in a flash –– the silhouette of a figure materializes out of the thicket of marks.Just like light in a burning mirror, color in El-Saieh’s and Singh’s paintings is both a visual and a tactual component. Arguing for color as a “shamelessly plastic element” art historian Lex Morgan Lancaster states: “Chromatic abstraction can […] engage forms of spectatorship beyond the normative, not cohering a figure but producing more haptic encounters.”[2] In bundling, bouncing, and refracting light through various ways of handling color, El-Saieh and Singh open a space of articulation that reaches beyond language. Flaming Mirror communicates not only visually but viscerally through the entire range of senses––touch, smell, sound, and sight––, which might affect its surroundings in wholly unexpected ways, just short of bursting into flames.About the artistsTomm El-Saieh (b. 1984, Port-au-Prince, Haiti) is of Haitian, Palestinian, and Israeli descent. He grew up in Miami, FL, where he continues to live and work, while maintaining close personal and artistic ties to his native country.

Central to this is the notion of touch and its importance to the artist: ""to touch, understand a form, an object is like covering it with prints. A trace formed by the images that I have on my hands,"" wrote Penone in 1969. Beyond the conventions of sight, the imprint for Penone is touch transformed into a fossilized gesture that records and shapes our reality and our perceptions. An index of the individual it is simultaneously unique and ""the most democratic image that can be conveyed -- an image that leads human beings back to matter, to nature."" Touch and breath, forms which belong to everyone, transmute the tactile into the visual, underlying Penone's notion of living sculpture.A point of departure in this exhibition is an early sculpture from 1979-82 titled Cocci (Shards), which traces the imprint of the artist's cupped hands holding a fragmented vessel, preserved through poured plaster. These solidified forms delineate both the residual shards of a vessel and the shape of the artist cupping his hands around it, reminiscent of the primordial gesture of trying to keep hold of what is fluid.Inspired by the gestures and actions in Cocci, two decades later in 2004-05, Penone undertook a similar process: creating larger plaster shapes tracing the imprint of the hand, substituting children's wooden blocks for vessel fragments, and casting the blocks into steel. With the plaster shapes in bronze, and the wooden blocks in steel, Geometria nelle mani (Geometry in the Hands), 2005, was created. A series of five sculptures on view here, they contain a memory of Cocci. Their seemingly natural bronze surfaces resemble human imprints and are juxtaposed with stainless steel geometries, creating a dialectic of forms. Within each of the sculptures lies a hidden complexity: a small void of the same shape as the wooden block through which we're able to glimpse the artist's hand - the principle of creation at the heart of Penone's practice.In a group of early works from 1970-1973, Coincidenza di immagini (Images Coincidence) and Svolgere la propria pelle (To Unroll One's Skin), photographs of a part of the body correlate to ink prints of their respective skin areas establishing a relationship between the visual representation and the perception of touch, and revealing the richness of the image of the skin. These works suggest that the physical encounter with the universe is more profound than the experience of it through sight.Trattenere 6, 8, 12, 16 anni di crescita (To Retain 6,8,12,16 Years of Growth), 2004-2020, is a cast in bronze of a hand grasping the trunk of a young tree, retaining a hold upon it even as the tree continues to grow around it for six, eight, twelve, sixteen years. From his first works, Alpi Marittime in 1968, for Penone the tree retains a memory of an action over time, giving life to the relationship between forms and the the imprint of the hand within a sculpture.Installed on the wall and suspended by a steel cable are the works from Avvolgere la terra - il colore nelle mani (To Enfold the Earth – the colour of the hands), 2014, each formed by enlarging a handful of clay bearing the imprint of the artist's hands, and revealing that imprint in terracotta and pigments of red, light pink, blue, and yellow.In his most recent works, a series titled Impronte di Luce (Imprints of Light), 2023, Penone turns to painting, exploring gesture and imprint in an entirely new context. In each of these works gestures of the hands imprinted on paper with ink are enlarged and transported onto canvas to create colorful compositions. The brilliantly hued colors of the background of the canvases are derived from Le Corbusier's 'architectural polychromy,' a chromatic palette of 63 colors formulated in 1931 and enriched in 1959. Each canvas has the proportions of a 183 x 183 cm perfect square, inspired by the 'Modulor,' Le Corbusier's anthropometric system of proportions and measurements based on the golden ratio.Resembling both imprints of bodies and abstract shapes, the dancing forms that emerge on these canvases appear anthropomorphic and vegetal. The inspiration for Impronte di Luce was an exhibition at the priory of Couvent de la Tourette, France in 2022, in which Penone responded to the original skin of Le Corbusier's building with a series of frottage drawings tracing the grain of wood in the walls, again interpreting them in the context of Corbusier's architecture and color scheme. The rubbings of the building anticipate the current works on view, reimagining them in a related palette and new form as gestures of the body: ""The imprint reveals the golden ratio that I have in my hands,"" says Penone.Giuseppe Penone was born in Garessio, Italy in 1947.

Perrotin,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/johan-creten-strangers-welcome/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perrotin-New-York.jpg,Johan Creten,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/johan-creten/,"The following is an essay written by Leigh Arnold for Johan Creten's newest catalogue, titled Strangers Welcome, which will be released concurrent to the opening of his exhibition at Perrotin New York.A large white whale in the middle of a green sea.Johan Creten’s description of the setting for his 2023 solo exhibition Le Coeur qui déborde (The Overflowing Heart) at the Abbaye de Beaulieu-en-Rouergue poetically references the unadorned Romanesque architecture of the 12th-century Cistercian abbey (notably, the white stone that comprises it) and the lush forest surrounding it, and effectively sets the scene for his “oceanic” exhibition of recent ceramic, resin, and bronze sculptures. In literature, the “white whale” refers to the central antagonist of Herman Melville’s 1851 epic novel, Moby-Dick, which follows a sea captain’s obsessive quest for vengeance against the natural instincts of a colossal leviathan. In the years since Moby-Dick’s publishing, the “white whale” has become synonymous with an obsession that is relentlessly pursued. Such could describe Creten’s own efforts to elevate ceramics to the level of “high art” within the realm of contemporary sculpture—a pursuit he took up nearly 40 years ago. Trained as a painter, Creten’s interest in clay began when he discovered an abandoned ceramics studio as a student at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent in the 1980s. “I chose ceramics also because nobody else was working with this material,” Creten explained, “There is a place to take [it], there is a history to write with this material. You can express things. You can talk about politics. You can talk about the world. You can talk about yourself.” Creten continues to chip away at the stale hierarchies that often denigrate media associated with use value or craft, like clay—an inexpensive and messy material that requires hands and labor to manipulate (rather than the “clean” ideas of conceptual art that are manipulated by the mind). Renouncing popular taste and trend, Creten’s sculptures are a feast for the eyes, with their gestural, virtuosic glazes and sumptuous surfaces that also light up the mind with their enigmatic and inscrutable references. Creten challenges his viewers to embark on their own individual quest for meaning and interpretation.Returning to the “oceanic” metaphor that permeates Le Coeur qui déborde (The Overflowing Heart): throughout the nave of the church, sea beasts—cheeky mermaids, sinful sirens, and seahorses undergoing metamorphosis—perched on color coded ceramic socles, while gleaming gold bas-reliefs containing abstract patterns evocative of mollusks, oyster shells, snakes, or eels lined the walls of the damp and dark cellar. Within this motif, Creten exploits a play on words to great effect: the French homonyms la mer / la mère: the sea and the mother become the artist’s protagonists. Personifications of the sea as feminine abound in literature and poetry that symbolically link the seas and ocean to creation, fertility, and mystery, but also to chaos, tempestuousness, and irrationality. Through this lens, the patterns on Creten’s gold bas- relief sculptures begin to take on forms of female sexual anatomy and remind us of another play on words: in French, “la moule” (mussel) is vulgar slang for vagina. The ambiguity in these wall-based works—are they representations of la mer or la mère? —is a leitmotif found in many of the artist’s sculptures, from the Odore di Femmina series, first shown in 1991, to his series of Waves for Palissy, begun in 2004, to the more recent bas-relief sculptures Relief IV (2012) or Vulva (2017).Creten installed the Éloge de l’ombre bas-reliefs at the same elevation along the cellar walls, creating a ribbon of gold or a lustrous frieze of shimmering patterns that situates them in the realm of architectural adornment. In the context of a religious setting, gold evokes illuminated manuscripts, the halos of saints in Eastern Orthodox icons, or chalices used in the Eucharist, but here it was a stark addition given the vows of piety, poverty, and adornment the monks inhabiting this Cistercian monastery would have followed. These works also functioned to bring light into the dark cellar through their reflective surfaces. Creten purposely left this space unlit to further dramatize subtle lighting on the variegated surfaces. This strategy refers to the writings of Jun’ichirō Tanizaki (Japanese, 1886-1965), whose 1933 essay, “In Praise of Shadows” (éloge de l’ombre in French) argues that the power of beauty resides in shadow and subtlety, rather than total illumination. By limiting the lighting, Creten further emphasized the many shadows in each work, referencing taboo subjects or the many holes and crevices of the human body that can be used for sexual pleasure (a hole is a hole is a hole).Intriguingly, a single work from this series, Nr 13 (2022-23), was inset in an alcove just outside the cellar and oriented vertically, with its long sides running parallel to the walls. Unlike others from Éloge de l’ombre that are dense with patterns and lines, Nr 13 contains only three elements: two tubes on either long side, with a sphere nestled in the center. As installed in the Abbaye, the bas-relief becomes a kind of threshold, with the long tubular forms pushed aside or opened by the ball between them. In this vertical orientation it also recalls Jasper Johns’s 1958 encaustic Grey Painting with Ball in which “the upright dimension is given by a gash in the canvas, pried and held open by an intruding ball.” Johns used wooden balls in several paintings of that period to critique the masculinity typically associated with Abstract Expressionism and the notion that a painting need have “balls” to be successful. Notably Johns came up one short of typical male anatomy with Grey Painting with Ball. While Creten’s Éloge de l’ombre – Nr 13 formally resembles Johns’s painting, in the context of the surrounding bas-reliefs from the series, with their labia-like patterns and the overarching theme of the sea, the sculpture becomes representative of anatomy of the opposite sex— the slit or “gash” (each slang for vagina) formed by two tubes becomes a point of creation and mystery. Rotating the sculpture’s orientation by 90 degrees, in line with others in the series, generates even further interpretations, transforming the gleaming central sphere into an enormous pearl in the mouth of a mussel or oyster, or an eye. In that sense, the work echoes Georges Bataille’s 1928 novella Story of the Eye (l’histoire de l’œil in French), a pornographic fantasy of two lovers delving into the world of sexual fetishes and deviancy. Roland Barthes would later go on to theorize about the centrality of the eye in Bataille’s novel and its interchangeability with testicles, eggs, and other ocular objects throughout.Moving into the nave of the church, the bestiary Creten created for his 2022 exhibition at La Piscine – musée d'art et d'industrie André Diligent de Roubaix continues with new humanoid aquatic creatures. La sirène effrontée (the naughty mermaid) and bronze La Laguna (a reference to Venice, the floating city), each feature female-coded effigies holding postures reminiscent of the Madonna in prayer. Installed around these seemingly pious characters were sculptures resembling seahorses undergoing metamorphosis to something otherworldly or hybrid in form. Their arms and hands—in some cases talon-like, while in others webbed like fish fins—ape the piety displayed by the mermaids, hinting at their true nature as beguiling and dangerous sea nymphs. In medieval bestiaries, the siren was an enchantress, who seduced, entrapped, and killed incautious and unmindful men through their propensity for causing shipwrecks. In the context of La Coeur qui déborde (The Overflowing Heart), these figures relate to ideas of sin, temptation, and the lurking dead.A sense of violence permeates many of Creten’s seahorse hybrids, as exemplified best in The Sex Addict, Pump and Dump / Satyriasis (2021-23). Featuring a kind of sea satyr resting on a socle glazed in the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue, the entire composition appears to be bleeding from a deep wound at the head or neck of the beast. Red and black glazes gush down its sides in homage to the gesture so emphatic in Abstract Expressionist painting. Even the pedestal’s colors bleed, with red dripping into the yellow band. Its title reads like a short poem that breaks down in three parts referencing a form of securities fraud or financial trickery—pumping up a stock price, only to dump it to reap the artificial rewards to the detriment of the economy—bookended by colloquial and pathological terms for sexual addiction. Altogether, The Sex Addict, Pump and Dump / Satyriasis references the type of creature Creten sculpted: a mischievous male spirit with an insatiable sexual appetite.Scattered throughout all the spaces were ceramics from Creten’s Observation Points series of hybrid sculptures / stools / pedestals, that resemble traditional bases used to display sculpture and function as seating for gallery visitors. “The hope is that you anchor your audience, to look, to turn around while they sit and see the works in a different way,” the artist describes, “And today, I think one of the greatest luxuries is time, and one of the most difficult things is how to look at things, how to calm down enough to look at things.” Creten strategically installed these works to correlate to different viewpoints. He also considers the number of Observation Points in any given space and how that will affect the dynamic and experience of his viewers: with one, there is observation; with two, there is dialogue; with three or more, there is a crowd, and so on. Their portability as stools that can simply be picked up and moved, along with their flag-like appearance, transform these objects into symbols of universal migration.In contrast to previous installations of Observation Points, the Bestiarium at Roubaix for example, the colors for those installed in the Abbaye were much more discreet, in keeping with the architecture and design of the Cistercian monastery. Creten’s previous Observation Points were glazed with bright primary colors commonly found at the circus: reds and yellows; bright pinks and blues. In contrast, Cirque 10, for example, is almost monochrome, with alternating shades of pale and grey blues recalling the iconography of Jasper Johns, whether the stars from his iconic Flag paintings or the lesser-known sculpture from 1958, while also referring to the six-pointed star in the nave of the abbey. Creten’s more subdued color palate for the observation points here suggest that this is not a place of whimsy or folly, but rather a place for somber reflection and appreciation.Creten’s Le Coeur qui déborde (The Oveflowing Heart) continues in part at Perrotin, New York as Strangers Welcome in June 2024, in a markedly different space: the “neutral” white cube gallery. Transposing the exhibition from one heart to another: the heart of one of the most remote places in France to that of the bustling contemporary art scene fulfills Creten’s desire to share these works with a wider audience (i.e., to welcome strangers to his most recent oeuvre) and in many ways further solidifies his place among the ranks of contemporary sculptors. Returning to the Moby-Dick reference that opened this essay, if Creten’s “white whale” is synonymous with the “white cube” of the contemporary art scene, it would seem he has caught it. The hybrid sculptures that populate both exhibitions—sea beasts or humans, pedestals (for display or performance) or seating (for observation or contemplation)—draw analogies to the human condition and all the dualities contained within it: sacred and secular, pious and sinful, beautiful and grotesque.— Dr. Leigh ArnoldCurator at the Nasher Sculpture Center (Dallas, TX)",Johan Creten: Strangers Welcome,"130 Orchard Street, NY 10002",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 1 Jun  - 26 Jul 2024  
Perrotin,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/charles-hascoet-kobayashi-maru/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perrotin-New-York.jpg,Charles Hascoët,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/charles-hascoet/,"Do you remember that pungent citrus smell of Calvin Klein One cologne that permeated the 1990s? For New York-based Parisian artist Charles Hascoët, the unisex CK One elicits olfactory memories of hope and innocence. In his debut solo show at Perrotin New York, Kobayashi Maru, Hascoët presents Giorgio Morandi-like still lifes featuring frosted glass flasks of CK One, colorful barbell- shaped Listerine bottles, and other curios that are unmistakably of an era and its sensual pleasures promised by the famous motto of “Purity. Unity. Sensuality.” And if these indelible mass-market 90s elixirs are not nostalgia-provoking enough, a small 2018 portrait of the cult underground electronic music artist Bogdan Raczynski wearing the t-shirt ""Rave till you cry"" will send you back to the 90s “happiness and respect” Rave culture in no time!Hascoët was raised in Paris and classically trained in painting at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris, from which he graduated in 2014, a school known for its traditional, rigorous approach. He belongs to a generation of artists—perhaps one of the last—whose fine art education was realized through in-person art critiques and studio visits, with work shared and viewed up close. Painting for Hascoët and his cohort was still painterly, an experience of lingering oil paint smells in messy object-filled ateliers— and not yet flattened by pocket-sized screens, NFTs, and the promiscuous interchangeability of viewing art on social media platforms.Indeed, Hascoët’s paintings cannot be fully appreciated until you have seen the brushstrokes, forms and textures up close. In addition to his desire to follow the tradition of figuration by extending it gesturally and abstractly, the art historical references informing his work further announce that Hascoët is a painter’s painter. In this body of work alone the attentive viewer will spot references to a wide range of figurative painters such as the 19th century French Romantic Eugene Delacroix’s reclining figures and self-portraits to Richard Diebenkorn and David Park’s mid-20th century Bay Area Figurative style portraits, still lifes, rich brushstrokes and palettes.The titular piece of the show, Kobayashi Maru (2024) portrays the artist in royal blue pajamas waking up from a nightmare with his bed-as-raft half on ocean water and half on shore, while in the distance an active volcano rages. There is danger, yes, but also escape and diversion, a tension found throughout this new body of work. The title references the famous Kobayashi Maru test which first appeared in the 1982 film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and was featured in numerous other Star Trek media. The Kobayashi Maru is a training exercise that tests Starfleet Academy cadets by forcing them to make an impossible choice: they are tasked with rescuing a threatened civilian fuel ship, but attempting to do so will provoke fatal enemy attacks on their own vessel. In the film, Captain Kirk concedes that as a cadet he rewrote the rules of the exercise, hacking and reprogramming the simulation to make it possible to save the ship. Kobayashi Maru grew to take on a double meaning in popular parlance, referring both to a no-win situation as well the incongruous belief that there is always a chance, always a way out.This palpable tension between peril and escapism, between immediate threat and deferral, is further emphasized in one of the show’s largest paintings. In The Waves (2024), Hascoët depicts himself floating on troubled waters in a vulnerable wooden boat— his body as large as the boat itself—seemingly oblivious while playing on his Gameboy. In another painting, Iceberg (2024), the artist, bundled in arctic gear, poses reclined on a floating iceberg he shares with a cuddly sleeping polar bear. This composition directly references Nicolas Poussin’s Echo and Narcissus c.1627—one of Hascoët’s favorite paintings—but is clearly updated to denote the dream-like dissociative survival mechanism we use to avoid the reality of this century’s extreme climate crisis.Hascoët approaches painting—as he described to me during a visit to his Bushwick studio in late March—sculpturally. (Unsurprisingly, he began his artistic life as a sculptor.) For the artist, this means that he understands his oil paintings as masses that occupy space, and he forms tableaux that challenge two dimensionality by positioning objects and figures in unexpected and iconoclastic ways. He explained that even the space between the paintings exposed on the wall is important to him. This physicality, this spatial sensitivity, shows up not just in his finished work but also in his process. The artist uses a plumb line as he works, an old-fashioned tool used to manually measure vertical lines and the alignment of elements, determining the center of gravity of an irregular shape. (Hascoët proudly showed off his plumb line—a beautiful yellow gold cord with a curved pointed brass weight attached to it—to me like his prized talisman.) Beyond the world of fine art, plumb lines were used by sailors to measure the depth of a body of water so as to avoid shallow waters and the dangers below. In this way, Charles Hascoët’s use of the plumb line operates for me metaphorically and practically as a means to more deeply understand the artist’s work. Hascoët is a very physical painter, obsessed with recurring water themes and sculptural bodies, objects and the self in space.The self-portraits of the artist that dominate his new works in Kobayashi Maru are large in scale and may appear primarily auto-biographical and self-referential on first view, but they operate beyond solipsism, richly and metonymically, personally and collectively. Their playful and optimistic accessibility is enhanced by references to countless millennial quirks, trends and fetishes: Furbies, the little electronic hamster/owl hybrid toys originally released in 1998; techno DJs; geek and underground culture tropes; Jaws (1975); PlayStation; Super Nintendo; X-Files; Jean- Claude Van Damme in Hard Target (1993) and other retro pop culture references.Hascoët’s imaginary worlds seem to reflect our uncomfortable contemporary moment that is plagued by isolation, irrevocable environmental destruction, doomsday spirals, and collective and generalized anxiety. Yet Hascoët’s fantastical utopian scapes and escapes are rendered with much humor and nostalgia. They show him in various stages of repose, unconsciousness and play; but looming insecurity and imperilment are ever-present. These images are not just about external threats but inner psychological struggles as well.In another painting of this Kobayashi Maru series, Shiatsu (2024), a ghostly purple blob-like monster with beady red eyes is giving the artist, seen lying relaxed on a watery-blue bed, a gentle massage. This particular creature, what Hascoët described as “an inner demon of [his] darker side,” has appeared in several of the artist’s past paintings, but what differentiates Shiatsu from other works is a tone hinting to resolution: “Here,” Hascoët said, “we seem to be getting along quite well.”- Natasha Boas",Charles Hascoët: Kobayashi Maru,"130 Orchard Street, NY 10002",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 1 Jun  - 26 Jul 2024  
Perrotin,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/alex-gardner-psychic-stamina/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perrotin-New-York.jpg,Alex Gardner,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/alex-gardner/,"Gardner’s new body of work is both inherently optimistic and wholly voracious. His paintings offer the simple yet tender notion of art as solace, through encounters that are simultaneously estranged yet achingly familiar. In America, belonging can often seem just out of reach, including for Gardner himself who is bi-racial. Such is existing in a society where each perspective has its own extremities, isolating the proverbial other. When our burdens become increasingly hard to bear, the exhibition's title, Psychic Stamina, suggests, home might simply be found in one’s own head and heart.In a country which sees itself as two colors, and where civility–like an endangered species–grows increasingly rare, Gardner’s paintings open a space of reflection. Who are we and where do we go from here?Gardner’s enigmatic work is provocative and unsettling without being confrontational, as exemplified by Endurance, the artist’s foray into sculpture which is placed at the entrance of the exhibition. The bronze bench, in the likeness of a face-down individual whose body hangs between two reflective pillars, invites visitors to answer the question of how much weight can one bear alone?This is Gardner’s undeniable strength–the ability to raise open- ended questions about our everyday life, and the realities we inhabit, leaving everything up for subjective interpretation. It seems that the prone figure is enduring but we do not know how or why he came to be in this uncomfortable position. By inviting viewers to sit on the figure, the artist is asking us to consider what toll our comfort takes on others. This is just one of the many tough questions embedded in his work.Gardner’s close-up views of cropped, featureless figures are both immediate and cryptic. Many are literally and metaphorically untethered, as in Enjoying The Ride, No Prenup For The Thrill, and Leveraged (Living in The Red). In Exploding On The Launch Pad, a barefooted toddler in reddish-orange shorts and t-shirt is inexplicably rising into the air. Set against a solid yellow ground, the painting of a bare-legged brown child in shorts and a t-shirt marked by thick, drapery-like folds can also be read as a painting of tonal relationships. As in his other paintings, the color infuses the scene with an emotional tenor, in this case, childhood exuberance. And yet, the longer we look at the painting, the more ambivalent it becomes. Why is the child rising into the air? Are the children’s playroom colors joyful? Or do they bring to mind the heat of a conflagration?While the luminous monochromatic grounds of Gardner’s paintings evoke a nameless abstract, the untethered figures seem buoyant. They embody an ambiguity, between rising and falling, comfort and disaster. They evoke an in-between moment, where we cannot deduce what happened before nor guess what will happen next. This is certainly true of Jungle (We Look Different to eachother) and Leaves Falling Gently On My Corpse, where intimate moments also feel like ones of estrangement. Gardner pulls the viewer into the tight space of his paintings.By edging the contour of the figures in pink or red, the photographic effect of halation endows his subjects with an otherworldly, spectral luminosity. They exist in a world that is adjacent to ours in recognizable attire, but at the same time, is remote and unreachable. They follow an interior logic we cannot discern, as in Jungle (We Look Different to Eachother), where two identical figures appear to be pressing their faces into each other. Another figure, who is dressed like the others, appears to be standing on her hands, suggesting we are looking at a performance.Everywhere we turn in Gardner’s pastel-colored paintings, we encounter something we cannot fully fathom. This resistance to labels conveys Gardner’s desire for freedom, to not be trapped in categories or other people’s agendas. To achieve that freedom requires stamina and endurance, which Gardner clearly possesses in these remarkable, enigmatic works.- John Yau",Alex Gardner: Psychic Stamina,"130 Orchard Street, NY 10002",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 1 Jun  - 26 Jul 2024  
Pontone,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/actions-perceptions/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",,,"Letter from the curator, Max Lust:Are we doomed to be free? Sartre would say yes, we are stuck in the paradox of choices where even the choice not to choose is nevertheless a choice, proper. Despite the mistakes I have made in my private life-choosing to live my personal life in bad faith, which I paid for dearly-throughout my professional life I have made myriad choices as a collector and curator. These choices are presented before you. This exhibition tells my personal story in the form of a gesamtkunstwerk, or ""total work of art"", a pop-up art bar. In it are art objects represented by my friends and colleagues. It comprises a cross-over of various art markets and periods that, wittingly or not, I fell in love with, ranging from Antiquities to Modern and Contemporary art to art by young, emerging artists.This exhibition is deeply personal. After moving back to New York during the height of the pandemic, and following a dramatic rise and fall in Vienna's art scene, I rebuilt my career and new life in Manhattan. Although I was born the grandson of an important collector, this was not my choice. However, it became my choice to follow in his footsteps, the sole member of ten grandchildren and two sons to do so. It was, indeed, a choice to take up the mantle and honor my grandfather's legacy, mastering what Napoleon fortuitously called the ""[ability] to master luck""! In particular, I inherited my grandfather's vim to ﬁnd the most cutting-edge art. Although the 1990s more or less remained my grandfather's cut-oﬀ, I began expanding the timeline of the family collection when I started collecting Shepard Fairey prints at the age of 17. My fascination with Antiquities began during the pandemic, while still living in Vienna. I thus inaugurated the lengthy process of teaching myself how to read Egyptian hieroglyphics, a process I would continue after moving back to New York. I fell into the antiquities market purely by happenstance, during a stroll past a shop with what appeared to be an Egyptian relief in the window. My ﬁrst thought was that there was no way that this was real. But I was surprised when I peered at the label, which read ""Old Kingdom"". And there I was with a choice-to continue walking or go inside. I chose the latter and ended up making a new friend who was kind enough to consign many of the antiquities in this show.The fact that this show transpired is a rapprochement between blind luck and intentional choosing. For instance, Allan D'Arcangelo, whose work is displayed here, is an artist whom my grandfather ardently collected and one that I, too, deeply admire. In 2018, I returned to New York to attend auctions and art fairs during the ""high art"" season. My Austrian friends and I were at the Frieze preview, walking around the various booths. It was like being hit by a ton of bricks when we stumbled on a booth dedicated to D'Arcangelo's work. This was pure luck and I espied an opportunity. As a representative of the family collection, I introduced myself to the gentleman working the booth, who was none other than Martin Friedrichs. Martin had organized this D'Arcangelo exhibition. Six years later, he went independent and founded Friedrichs Pontone. We stayed in contact with one another throughout the years and, roughly four months ago, I was displaced from my flat following a major ﬁre in my building. Martin reached out to me regarding an unrelated matter when I then pitched the concept of the current exhibition to him. He agreed and here we are. This arc is thus represented by the Allan D'Arcangelo 1965 work-on-paper from my family collection.This exhibition is idiosyncratic, including well-known and young artists. It includes friends and those whom I never had an opportunity to meet. The nexus is a network built on luck, cold-calling, complimentary drinks and discussions occasioned by art openings. This is my third exhibition since moving back to New York and my fifth-ever in New York. This show is a cocktail of art. Roughly two-thirds are works from emerging artists, one-third from my family collection, and there is a splash of antiquities. Each week, a novel drink will be introduced to be paired with a rotating cast of artworks located behind the bar. The show celebrates spontaneity, changing weekly based on various events, some public and others private. Exhibited artists and works are subject to change without reason or warning. The pairings, however, expound genealogies of influence. Philip Hinge's devotional study of feline art is paired with the fragmented Egyptian bust of Baset, the Egyptian cat goddess. This thread illuminates feline devotion spanning over two thousand years. Fox Fagan, a promising 24-year-old artist, is paired with photographer Carlotta Corpron; both engage light and its diffusion. Corpron is a pioneer from the 1940s who experimented with motile camera movements and shutter speeds, creating architectural studies influenced by Moholy-Nagy. Fagan overexposes her film negatives to light, transferring the mylar image by way of tracing. And last but not least is the performance-cum-assemblage works of Young Boy Dancing Group (YBDG), which harken back to Viennese Actionism-in particular, Hermann Nitsch's photos of Rudolf Schwarzkogler's 1960s performances. The latter is represented by a photograph from my family's collection. One of the most piercing memories from my childhood, this photo frightened me quite a bit as a child. YBDG is also nostalgic. I became acquainted with some of their members in the Vienna art world. Following a wild few evenings at a popular drag party in Vienna, we reconnected in New York.Stop me if you've heard this one before… a man walks into a bar and orders a shot. He throws it back and looks at a photo nested in his wallet. He orders another shot and, after imbibing it, again peers at the photo. After repeating this action several times, the befuddled bartender asks, ""What is the photograph of?"" The man replies, ""It's a photo of my wife. When she starts to look good, I know to go home."" Sometimes it feels like this is the reason that art openings serve alcohol. When inebriated, even the most amateurish art might uncloak its dilettante embellishments, revealing something of genuine interest. But this is not the reason to imbibe here. The drinks, like the works, are cultivated with great intentionality. If you like the show, have a drink. If you don't like the show, have a drink. If you don't drink alcohol, just have a soda. After all, you are free to do as you please.To drink or not to drink, to like or dislike the exhibition, are personal choices. But with a gesamtkunstwerk, the percipient's experience-that very moment you view and engage the art object-itself arguably becomes a moment of art, briefly imbricated in the full latticework of art objects. Like the contemporary art in the exhibition, the antiquities on view were at one point contemporary. The earliest work of art in the collection, an Egyptian ceramic from the Gerzean (Naqada II, 3500-3200 BCE) Protodynastic Period, was once new. The piece was made well over 5000 years ago, but how we continue interacting with it today becomes a part of its story. If mankind is still around in 7024 AD, these ""contemporary"" works will also be 5000 years old, indexing an ancient epoch. Is that relevant? Well, that is up to you. But here you are, presented with the choice to enjoy the art, the drinks, and live in the moment, figuring in the fold of this epoch.Featuring works by:David BufordConner ChaseMaia del EstalFox FaganAngel LovecraftLuke Libera MooreSarah MuirheadJoseph ParraBill RabinovitchPasha SmelyantsevYoung Boy Dancing Group",Actions & Perceptions,"273 Church Street, NY 10013",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 3 May  - 8 Jun 2024

Eversley’s presentation represents not only his first public sculpture in New York, but also the first outdoor placement of the artist’s large-scale polyurethane resin works.“Fred Eversley’s art immerses us in perceptual experiences that bring us outside of ourselves. He explores how an artwork may inhabit the world around it while simultaneously inviting us into the realms of imagination and mystery,” said Public Art Fund Artistic & Executive Director Nicholas Baume. “Parabolic Light, Eversley’s first public work in his home city, takes his series of pristine cylindrical sculptures to a new scale and context, engaging with the ever-changing outdoor environment, the effects of natural light, and the countless visitors whose attention it captures.”New York-based artist Fred Eversley is a pioneer of the West Coast Light and Space and Finish Fetish movements. With his scientific background as an electrical and aerospace engineer informing his artistic practice for over fifty years, Eversley is renowned for his vivid cast resin works that invite audience-artwork interaction through a range of sensory phenomena. Dedicated to expressing ideas about energy as a physical and metaphysical concern for all of humanity, Eversley’s sculptures center on the parabola, the only shape that concentrates all forms of energy—light, sound, and heat—into a single acoustic and optical focal point.“My parabolic forms are all about energy. They are made to reflect all the infinite combinations of internal reflections, refractions, color changes, and other optical phenomena that one can experience within a single sculpture,” said artist Fred Eversley. “Parabolic Light and its display in Doris C. Freedman Plaza resonates with my vision of an energetic outdoor focal point to attract public audiences to spontaneously pause, slow down, and engage in numerous ways with a cosmic, mystifying object.”Eversley’s presentation with Public Art Fund marks an ambitious continuation of his new Cylindrical Lens works, the artist’s first series of larger-than-human-scale, free-standing, floor-based sculptures. These recent works—which debuted at David Kordansky Gallery in May 2023—are conceptually linked to the cylindrical section sculptures the artist first exhibited in his first solo presentation at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1970. The largest work of the series thus far, Parabolic Light, is shaped as a plano-convex lens that focuses light into a single line. It acts as an optical instrument where stillness and motion appear to be present at the same time. Its geometrical mass gradually transitions its magenta hue, from rich saturation at its bottom to colorless transparency at the apex. The color saturation further shifts depending on the angle of the viewer and the direction of the sun. The sculpture obtains its luminous tone and reflective quality from its crystal-clear resin material and through a labor-intensive hand-polishing process. Parabolic Light appears simultaneously reflective and transparent, liquid and solid—a manmade form with an otherworldly, ethereal quality.Parabolic Light prompts questions about how optical and physical perceptions determine how we connect with each other and the world, communicating a kinetic, palpable sense of the mysterious presence of energy throughout the universe. The sculpture’s properties, and direct placement on the ground, entice viewers to approach and move around the work. Bending, distorting, and reflecting faces, forms, and colors, the work heightens the relationship between the viewer’s body and the cylindrical lens. This key performative facet is on full display in this outdoor work. Interacting with natural light and spontaneous passers-by, it represents Eversley’s most far-reaching and dynamic foray into the cultivation of audience-artwork interaction to date. The work's outdoor site allows for natural light to hit its surface and further generate a range of refractions and prismatic effects, connecting the viewer’s senses with the object and the environment in spellbinding ways. In this way, the sculpture expands and destabilizes multiple states of existence and perception. Straddling the scientific, metaphysical, and mystical, the sculpture functions as a portal for viewers to a world of radiant color, abstracted form, and a re-examination of one’s self and others within our surroundings.Fred Eversley: Parabolic Light is curated by Public Art Fund Artistic & Executive Director Nicholas Baume with support from Public Art Fund Assistant Curator Jenée-Daria Strand, and developed by former Public Art Fund Senior Curator Allison Glenn.ABOUT THE ARTISTFred Eversley (b. 1941, Brooklyn, New York) is a key figure in the development of contemporary art from Los Angeles during the postwar period. He synthesizes elements from several art historical movements associated with Southern California, including Light and Space, though his work is the product of a pioneering vision all his own, informed by lifelong studies on the timeless principles of light, space, time, and gravity. Prior to becoming an artist, Eversley moved to California to become an engineer, collaborating with NASA and major aerospace companies to develop high-energy acoustic and vibration testing laboratories. Eversley’s work on NASA’s second and third human spaceflight programs, Gemini and Apollo, developed his interest in the parabola, which began when he was a teen. His pioneering use of plastic, polyester resin, and industrial dyes and pigments reflects the technological advances that define the postwar period even as his work reveals the timeless inner workings of the human eye and mind.Eversley will unveil his largest Public Commission to date, a sculptural installation, titled “Portals”, for permanent display in Able’s Park, at One Flagler, West Palm Beach in early summer of 2024, commissioned by Related Companies in partnership with the City of West Palm Beach. He has also been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Orange County Museum of Art, Costa Mesa, California (2022–2023); Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts (2017); Art + Practice, Los Angeles (2016); National Academy of Science, Washington, D.C. (1981); Palm Springs Art Museum, California (1977); Newport Harbor Art Museum, Newport Beach, California (1976); and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1970). Eversley will be part of two major group shows as part of the Pacific Standard Time Art and Science Collide program 2024. Recent group exhibitions include Light and Space, Copenhagen Contemporary, Copenhagen (2021–2022); Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power 1963–1983 (2017–2020, traveled to five venues); Space Shifters, Hayward Gallery, London (2018); Dynamo – A Century of Light and Motion in Art, Grand Palais, Paris (2013); Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945–1980 (Getty Foundation, 2011; traveled to Gropius Bau, Berlin, 2012). His work is in the permanent collections of more than three dozen museums throughout the world, including Tate Modern, London; Guggenheim Museum, New York; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas; Museum of Modern Art, New York; K11 Art Foundation, Hong Kong; and Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The first monograph dedicated to Eversley’s work was published by David Kordansky Gallery in 2022. Eversley lives and works in New York City.",Fred Eversley: Parabolic Light,"Central Park, Doris C.

She made the four bronze sculptures featured in Before The End by casting carved cork and skull fragments. The mysterious figures recall ancient effigies cut into tombstones.These expressive eight-foot-tall forms, titled Feel the Hammer, Member, Mr. Stone, and Nothing Falls, appear to be emerging from the depths of the earth, or perhaps returning to the underworld, their surfaces evoking centuries of eroded sediment and stone. The exhibition’s title, Before The End, creates a sense of momentous intensity, theatricality, and subtle humor. Like the sculptures themselves, Bhabha’s influences span across time and genre, including classic cult horror films like Destroy All Monsters, H.R. Giger’s designs for the Alien franchise, and the work of artists including Giacometti, Marisol, and Basquiat.“Huma Bhabha’s eccentric characters captivate through contradiction, seemingly forged in geological time yet animated with a visceral sense of immediacy,” said Public Art Fund Executive & Artistic Director Nicholas Baume. “Before The End is set amidst the expansive landscape of Brooklyn Bridge Park, a site where natural and man-made elements converge, allowing the works to take on a profound sense of connection to the earth.”Situated in staggered positions along the Pier 3 Uplands at Brooklyn Bridge Park, Bhabha’s monumental sculptures will conjure a sense of mystery and ambiguity. Surrounded by formidable landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty, One World Trade, and the waterways and bridges between boroughs, viewers are prompted to contemplate these totemic, larger-than-life forms. The park itself also serves as a significant setting, having undergone an evolution over time that conceals the rubble of centuries of history beneath its surface.Before The End is Bhabha’s second time presenting work with Public Art Fund, following the inclusion of her sculpture, The Orientalist, in the group exhibition Statuesque at City Hall Park in 2010. She continues to push the boundaries of contemporary sculpture with her unique visual language. Bhabha’s hybrid forms seem to exist in their own parallel universe, offering visitors an opportunity to reflect upon their own time and place.Huma Bhabha: Before The End is curated by Public Art Fund Executive & Artistic Director Nicholas Baume with support from Public Art Fund Assistant Curator Jenée-Daria Strand.",Huma Bhabha: Before The End,"Brooklyn Bridge Park, Pier 3 Greenway Terrace, NY 11201","All day, every day", 30 Apr 2024 - 9 Mar 2025

His solo exhibition of works at Macbeth Gallery in 1937 made headlines. It was a sold-out exhibition of watercolors inspired by Maine, a place of deep personal significance to the artist. The Wyeth family is part of the fabric of Maine and Wyeth had spent summers there since childhood. A critic for Art in America wrote in one of many euphoric reviews of the artist's coming-out exhibition, ""Wyeth uses his brush with a really almost spectacular freedom."" This energetic and unbridled approach to watercolor launched Wyeth's career and fame.Schoelkopf Gallery is delighted to present Enter Andrew Wyeth, the inaugural exhibition in the gallery's ongoing programming dedicated to the artist. The exhibition features 25 works in tempera, watercolor, drybrush, and pencil, and examines the stirring emotional resonance of Wyeth's work. The exhibition is composed of works created between 1939 - the year Wyeth met Betsy, his future wife and steward of his artistic legacy - and 1994. The gallery is honored to be supported in the exhibition by Patricia Junker, Ann M.

The selected artists in this group presentation were all drawn to and dedicated to experiments in repetition, balance, and iterative geometries, engaging in various investigations of color theory, optics, and the construction of visual understanding and experience through sequential patterns.Highlights in the show include (to Don Judd, colorist) 1-7, an extraordinary series of seven monochromatic lithographs in saturated hues by Dan Flavin, dedicated to his good friend and collaborator Donald Judd. The lithographic plates were inked edge-to-edge with an even application of color, most of which were straight out of the can, that overruns the papers’ deckled edges on three sides.Exhibited on the facing wall is Donald Judd’s exceptionally rare set of 13 woodcuts in cadmium red and cerulean blue that were selected to be republished by Judd and Edition der Galerie Heiner Friedrich in 1969. They depict Judd’s various iterations on parallelograms and their corresponding mirror images and elaborate his interest in lines, intervals, and divisions of pictorial space.Complete sets by Sol Lewitt, Robert Mangold, and Brice Marden will also be featured in the show.",Sequence,"146 Greene Street, NY 10012",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 25 Apr  - 31 May 2024

Working on thick grain linen with raw pigment in a distinct palette of vermillion, lilac, raw sienna, and ochre, she renders her scenes with a fluid painterly freedom that is nevertheless quiet and precise in its effect. Across her work, she recalls aspects of the Symbolist ethos, which moved between nostalgia and rupture, seeking not to capture something directly, but rather convey the sensations it produces.In her new paintings, Longe focuses on the nude. Articulated in spare, suggestive gestures, her subjects, largely women, are pictured huddled together, embracing a lover, or striding alone. Some set their gaze on an unknown distance, others stare down the viewer, and one confronts a fish. Each seems possessed by a disquieting tension that is emphasized by a shadowy apparition lurking in many of the works. Masculine in stature, the incubus perches over a scene or cradles another figure therein. Where Longe’s previous series reflect on social dynamics, depicting parties and crowds, these paintings are more personal; the artist explains that the new works look inward rather than outward. Expressive, brushy marks bring subtle notions of agitation, dreaminess, and intimacy to otherwise minimal passages of color.These paintings further explore the ideas set out in Longe’s earliest work, which emerged from her study of classical portraiture at Charles H. Cecil Studios in Florence; in her early canvases, Longe integrated and recontextualized themes and styles of old-master paintings. Here, her compositions draw from Secessionist painter Otto Friedrich’s nudes and Symbolist Ferdinand Hodler’s ominous portraits. They likewise reveal the influence of a recent trip to Oslo, where Longe was taken by Henrik Sorensen’s mural (1938–50) in Oslo City Hall (where the Nobel Peace Prize is selected), and the marginalia of illuminated manuscripts. Ushering these disparate sources and traditions into her singular aesthetic, Longe poses subtle questions about representation—who it serves, and what narratives it upholds—just as she underscores figuration’s expressive potential.",Sahara Longe: Sugar,"74 Leonard Street, NY 10013","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 2 May  - 15 Jun 2024
