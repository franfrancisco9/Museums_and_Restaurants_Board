A arte Invernizzi,Milan,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/pino-pinelli/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Pino Pinelli,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/pino-pinelli/,"From the beginning of the 1970s, Pino Pinelli redefined the concept of pictorial space, bringing the colour of his monochrome canvases to overflow from the limits of the painting. This overflowing reaches extreme results in the middle of the decade when his works, created with painted material in which the arrangement of colours becomes body, physical and real presence become autonomous figures immersed in space. His work has always been conceived as a pictorial body, as an organism that occupies space thanks to the action of the gesture that builds its trajectories, concentrations and dilations, which contribute to the creation of a unified vision. As Pinelli himself states in the interview with Tommaso Trini “in each of my works it is as if I had fragmented the monochrome and disseminated it in space. The ‘frammentità’ [fragments] are entities that always arrange themselves autonomously in space according to this throwing gesture. In this way, I wanted to renew not painting as a genre, but my personal grammar of ‘painting-making’”. The material enhances the tactility of the chromatic value, which gives presence to the forms and leads to an involvement of the viewer in the here and now of the visual experience.The exhibition is conceived as a single itinerary through the two Milanese galleries, where the artist has been the protagonist - over the years - of numerous solo and group exhibitions: starting in the late 1970s at the Artra gallery and continuing in the 1990s and 2000s at A arte Invernizzi.At A arte Invernizzi, the exhibition is articulated on the two floors of the gallery, proposing large works, created between the late 1980s and early 1990s, which immediately manifest themselves as true tactile presences, thanks to the chromatic accords that create vibrant surfaces. The works are representative of Pinelli’s reflection on “dissemination”, in which the forms are no longer circumscribed within the limits of the frame but are free to dispose themselves on the wall, conceived as an active element in the realisation of the work. The upper floor of the gallery exhibits works belonging to the “Pitture” cycle, in which we witness a spatial and perceptive investigation, where each individual fragment contributes to creating the outline of the work. The work Pittura B/G (1991), in which round shapes of different sizes stand out superimposed on the surface of the wall in a circular rhythm, also emphasised by the alternation of the colours yellow and white, dialogues with Pittura N/G, also made up of circular figures that intersect, accentuating the work’s dynamism. The second room on the upper floor is instead entirely dedicated to works from the 1970s, such as Pittura R. (1975), Pittura B. R. B. (1975) and Pittura Rossa (1973), the latter work to which Tommaso Trini refers, in the interview in the catalogue, when he speaks of a “visionary work, like a red square suddenly waving in the sparse Martian atmosphere, a red square that the painter unfurls as if it were the cloth of a flag, whose virtual waving suggests air and life”. The lower floor houses five large disseminations from the late 1980s, such as Pittura N. G. (1989) and two large works in which Pinelli exalts more the “skin” of painting, highlighting seeds and roots of its infinite making.Galleria Artra held the artist’s first pesonal exhibition in 1979, showing works from the mid-1970s such as Pittura GR (1977) and some works from the “Pittura” cycle of 1976, which will be presented again on this exhibiting occasion. These are some of the works with which Pinelli began his reflection on the work as a pictorial body, released from the limits of the painting and free to expand and occupy space. In particular with Pittura GR (1977) the elements that make up the work suggest the perimeter of a square, broken and fragmented, whose sides open up and extend onto the wall.With Pittura B (1977) and Pittura GR (1978) there is a progression of several elements, which are arranged following an arched trajectory, creating tensions and leaps in contrast to the fixity of the wall and new balances in continuous movement. These works are part of the research on dissemination that the artist continued in the following decades and that finds its most complete outcome in the installation Pittura G. VR. VL. AR. (1982) where 12 elements played on the alternation of primary and complementary colours are freely arranged on the wall surface. Alongside these works, the work Pittura (1977) will also be displayed, as well as various other installations presented in solo exhibitions at the gallery in 1982 and 1985.The two exhibitions constitute a new opportunity to rediscover one of the most intense and productive periods of Pinelli’s activity, which constantly reinvented his language by seeking an active and continuous dialogue between work, space and spectator.On the occasion of the exhibitions, a bilingual catalogue will be published with an interview with Pino Pinelli by Tommaso Trini edited by Daniela Domina, a text by Carlo Invernizzi, reproductions of the works on display, and an updated bio-bibliographic section.A special thanks to Archivio Pino Pinelli.",Pino Pinelli,"Via Domenico Scarlatti 12, 20124","Mon-Fri 10am-1pm & 3pm-7pm, Sat by appointment", 21 May  - 16 Jul 2024

And the responsibility of being human comes from telling the story behind each word, so that there is no mistake in what is meant. For more than half a century, Nil Yalter’s work has been dedicated to uncovering the strength, resilience and hope that makes this fragile, intricate core, through stories of people that keep the world running with a deep critique of intersectional injustice. She has woven these stories with elements she borrowed from the ancient oral and visual traditions of Anatolia and codes of modernism she felt close to. The Story Behind Each Word Must Be Told focuses on one of the central threads of Yalter’s practice coming from the nomadic lives and their resistance in Aşık tradition in Anatolia for centuries: the word and the utterance, its sound and its music. From Topak Ev (1973) to D’Après Stimmung (1973), Shaman (1979), Exile is A Hard Job - Estranged Doors (1983) to Pixelismus (La Chora) (1993), Sound of Painting (2008) and Lord Byron Meets Shaman Woman (2009), she deals with the word and its intricate utterance in visual and oral forms.The Story Behind Each Word Must Be Told is inspired by the LP vinyl record “le chant des troubadours de turquie: Achik Nesimi” that Nil Yalter produced in collaboration with Bernard Dupaigne for Aşık Nesimi Çimen in 1979, who was at that time in exile in Paris. Born in Adana, Turkey, in 1931, Nesimi was the master of cura as one of the leading bards of his generation that connected the centuries old Aşık tradition with contemporary issues and struggles of his time. The exhibition also involves a performative element, a music and word-based gathering tributing Aşık Nesimi and his special friendship with Yalter as part of London Gallery Weekend.ARTIST BIOGRAPHYNil Yalter (b.1938, Cairo, Egypt), lives and works in Paris. A pioneer in the French feminist art movement of the 1970s, Yalter was educated at Robert College, the prestigious American secondary educational institution in Istanbul. While she was engaged in dance, theatre and painting during this time, she also practised pantomime and travelled by foot to India as a pantomime artist. Yalter has lived in Paris since 1965. She participated in the French counter culture and revolutionary political movement of the late 1960s, immersing herself in the debates around gender, migrant workers from Turkey, and other issues of the time. These social movements and ethnographic science have influenced the artist’s videos, performances and installations from the 1970s in the form of an idiosyncratic, pluralistic aesthetics. The influence of abstract traditions, especially that of Russian constructivism can be observed in her paintings and digital works since her early years. Nil Yalter’s works reflect a style that blends together all these influences along with autobiographical elements where the personal and the political intertwine.Nil Yalter is the recipient of the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement of the Venice Biennale 2024. Her works are part of institutional collections such as the Tate Modern, the Centre Pompidou, the Ludwig Museum and the Long Beach Museum, among others, as well as private collections such as the Art Collection Telecom, Colección Olor Visual, Reydan Weiss Collection and Fundación Foto Colectania. She has participated in international art fairs such as Art Basel Basel, ARCO Madrid, Art Cologne, FIAC, Frieze Masters, Armory Show, Frieze y Frieze NY, to cite a few, as well as the 10th Gwangju Biennial in 2014, the 15th Sharjah Biennial in 2023, the 13th Istanbul Biennial in 2013 and selected for the 60th Venice Biennale. Among her most recent solo exhibitions stand out examples such the ones at the Museum Ludwig, the MAC-VAL and the Hessel Museum of Art in 2019, the FRAC Lorraine and the ARTER space for art in Istanbul in 2016, and the ones at the Centre Pompidou in 2012 and 2010. Her work has been part of group exhibitions at the MoMa New York in 2023, Palais de Beaux-Arts in Paris in 2018, the WIELS. The Absent Museum in Brussels in 2017, the New Tate Modern in London in 2016, the Centre Georges Pompidou in 2013 and 2009, the Long Beach Museum of Los Angeles in 2011, the PS1 MOMA in 2008 and the CGAC in Santiago de Compostela in 2007, among many others.",Nil Yalter: The Story Behind Each Word Must Be Told,"34 Mortimer St, W1W 7JS",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 30 May  - 10 Aug 2024

Unlike these contemporaries, many of whom embraced commercial techniques, Thiebaud described himself as a traditional painter of illusionistic forms. He repeatedly tackled familiar, everyday subjects to challenge and explore the formal possibilities of painting. His meticulously crafted surfaces are steeped with art historical references and a subtle longing for a sweeter time.In Strawberry Cone (1969) the simplicity of the composition highlights Thiebaud’s technical approach to his paintings. Richly painted in pastel shades of pink, the ice cream emerges almost sculpturally against a stark, blank background, its thick layers of paint bulging past the flat plane of the canvas. Dedicated to a tradition of figuration, Thiebaud’s Strawberry Cone demonstrates the artist’s strength in color and masterful use of impasto and brushwork, with the swaths of creamy paint suggesting the ice cream melting in front of the viewer. His painting Jolly Cones (2002) reflects his sustained interest in the role of sweets as a collective experience, imbuing the painting with the same strain of nostalgia that he employed nearly four decades earlier.Though most famous for his persistent rendering of still lifes, portraiture and landscapes were also central to the artist’s practice over the many decades of his career. His portraits reflect a similar modality as his scenes of food– highly stylized, colorful subjects set against distilled backgrounds. Betty Jean (1965) presents the artist’s wife sporting a striped swimsuit in profile, extending her focus past the edge of the frame. Rendering the face with a playful veracity, Thiebaud subverts the image subtly by changing the perspective of the torso to a three-quarters position, flattening the swimsuit’s stripes against the contours of the body. The brightly patterned swimsuit creates a moment of technical interest and abstraction that hints at a body in motion, ready to dip into summer’s waters.This same subversion of perspective also defines the artist’s landscapes, blending points of view to create dreamy realities of the beach bending against water and heat. Tidelines (2004–2014) pushes the artist’s strength in landscapes to its limits, casting his beachgoers into oscillating passages of color. In the foreground, the beachgoers buzz with detail and motion, inducing a feeling of summer ease and nostalgia. As the painting recedes, however, the rendering of the beach distorts and twirls. In lucid hues of yellow, purple, and blue, Thiebaud disrupts the atmospheric perspective with a quickening flatness, rejecting the vanishing point for an absorbing color field thick with movement and animated brushwork. Echoing lapping waves and the long hours of summer days, Tidelines welcomes the viewer into a hypnotizing scene reminiscent of calm, playful vacations in thick heat.Wayne Thiebaud: Summer Days tracks the career of the artist over six decades, revealing his retained interest in lighthearted subjects while casting them in traditional modes of painting. This exhibition celebrates the artist’s regard for the delights of the quintessentially American summer experience, from its sweet ice creams and chilled soda pops to beach games and barbecues, melting a grey winter into a fading memory. In his paintings, an American nostalgia gently invites the viewer into the season’s space, readying them for warmer days ahead.The exhibition will be accompanied by an illustrated catalogue with essays by curator and art historian Steven Nash and art historian Mary Okin.",Wayne Thiebaud: Summer Days,"18 East 79th Street, NY 10075","Mon-Fri 10am-5pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 26 Apr  - 14 Jun 2024

She paints towards the liberation of women, symbolically connecting this emancipation with the growth and persistence of the natural world. The women in her paintings, semi-mythical images of bravery and power, stare boldly back at their viewer. The flowers, leaves, and twisting stems represent the vital force within us, and the promise of flourishing blossoms when adequately nourished and nurtured. Sometimes these natural elements come from memories or stories, which interweave her personal relationships into the narratives of the works.Her art is as socially engaged as it is poetic. She explores themes of peace and freedom in the context of ongoing war in her home country of Sudan. The nation-wide war in Sudan has now been waging for over a year, displacing millions and pushing the country to the brink of famine. Hymns of Peace visualises this conflict, and seeks a better outcome. The artworks in this collection become like seeds, planting alternative visions for a positive future.Amel’s artistic practice brings together pointillism, intricate ink drawings, and painting. Meticulous and methodical, Bashier applies thousands of small dots from the nib of her pen to create an imperceptibly solid composition.

During a previous stay of hers, Jana Schröder was amazed at how gadgets, T-shirts, flags and scale reproductions of Maradona in the colors of the Neapolitan team invaded every street. The blue and white colors create a recurring landscape with cheerful and fun, almost familiar tones. Therefore, although the artist has no particular football interests, he decided to undertake a production whose colors recalled the connection with Maradona's Napoli.""El Pibe de Oro"" represents for Neapolitans the revenge of an area that until the 1980s had always remained on the margins. The popular identification in that young Argentine boy, raised in the most deprived suburbs of Buenos Aires, who led the team and the city to indelible victories ensured that the memory did not fade over time and that his figure became a myth.Thus the large abstract white and blue paintings in the gallery rooms symbolize Maradona challenging the colors of other teams. Ideal teams that are pitted against each other in the gallery rooms with canvases of different colors ranging from acerbic green tones to orange to bright pink. The arrangement of the works does not follow the typical pattern; rather, the works stand in the space like soccer players on the field. In addition to the eleven canvases, there are eleven works on paper in the main room that reproduce an ideal formation made up of goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards, lined up as in a soccer scheme.Each work follows declinations of shades of the same color combined with white. What varies is the texture of the gesture and its impression on the canvas. The artist also plays with lines and shapes, seemingly random, which instead subtend a pattern consisting of lines of different thickness, now sinuous now geometric that chase each other across the canvas. In pursuit of the rapid drying times of acrylic, the multidirectional movements of the fast brushstrokes become symbols of the purest pictorial gesture. Like a dense net that, however, does not trap the viewer, but acts as a bank accompanying his gaze.Jana Schröder was born in 1983 in Brilon, DE.She lives and works in Düsseldorf, DE.Schröder’s artistic practice is based on the action of painting itself. The formalist education in the class of Albert Oehlen at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf deeply influenced her in producing paintings characterized by sinuous brushstrokes that guide the viewer in the discovery of a complex composition through many layers of color. Schröder’s practice is a meditation on process and repetition, slowness and speed, the process becomes part of the work. Lines, grids or rhythmised webs suggest the elusive movement of her hand. Her research reveals that every painting, every paperwork strikes out with its own experience and composes itself as an individual sign. Schröder operates with the aesthetic matter of everyday scribbling holding something the application of colour longs for: spontaneous, casual, and self-evident originality. The deliberation of such moments is a relief of gestures which in its nebulous density of information prevents any reconstruction of the painterly act, is contrasted by parts of more frenzied, quickly-applied paint which register the trace of the artist’s decisive hand at work.",Jana Schröder: D.

Ours has been a constant search for the grammar of life: methods by which we can extract sense from non-sense, decipher meaning from chaos, find vocabulary for the wisps we once resorted to calling ‘ghosts’. In its making visible the invisible, the act of excavation seeks to rescue the intelligible from the darkness of ignorance by reconstituting, piecemeal, fossilised memory. So begins the philosophical conundrum in which Hong Kong born artist Yi To prefigures the materiality of fragmented body, and its reappearance in the virtual as sign.What happens with the immense onslaught of time, its unerring passage? A document, artefact or vestige of life that endures erasure appeals to the unconscious vis a vis aesthetic sensibility before anything else. Like To’s work, that which issues from bygone eras hovers someplace between figuration and abstraction, and occasions a reading that relies, firstly, on intuition. From the presence of the golden spiral in the human ear, to the ability of an amoeboid organism to solve a maze, to the sophistication of the self-assembling flagellum, the wonderment in intuition is perhaps its intimation of intelligent design.To’s intervisuality is thus a holding-in-contradiction of both the spectacle of discovery and the withdrawal of nether worlds that cannot fully be known. Her paintings, with their shadowy forms rendered in thin washes, beget a fragility. They take on the propositional aspects of loss, an eclipse’s negative memory; as with the yet-to-be-discovered relic, what results is the invocation of a waiting. What of the total indifference of these subjects to the indefatigable curiosity of the present? What of the misapprehension of a cave painting that derails studies of early life for another thousand years?The fascination of To in working with the ambiguity of primary forms suggests we approach the mystery of the world as either encrypted, veiled, or an illusion requiring some kind of denudation. Her specific choice of overcast palette – be it soft Verdigris, greying mould, or healing bruise – confounds the interpreter’s authority to strip or lay bare. In Buddhist culture, depictions of young female corpses represent impermanence and the ephemeral nature of identity coherence: the contemplation of their splayed bodies has everything to do with denudation, deconstruction and dispersal. If To’s work is ‘a thought experiment turning the body inside out’, then the significance of this reference is in its anxiety-ridden becoming: from intellectually-bound life to its transformation into bone, gristle and, ultimately, effervescent sign. For the body transcended is precisely what permits its crossing realms human and non-human. Spanning time and space, To’s intervisuality comes to bear in another speculative gesture: a series of spindly sculptures suggestive of techno-syncretic fossils that, like interpretation, is capable of endless recombination given time.A thing of absurd misfortune is that interpretation is the essence of our study, yet at the same time unavoidably perverts it. This, To’s practice works with: achingly unanswerable questions, adumbrate shapes that may withstand temporal wearing, but are otherwise unable return to Earth as concrete form. In To’s work, it is therefore only absence that proposes itself, and must then lay in wait. Nothing to be done. So begins Samuel Beckett’s existential two-act deadlock Waiting for Godot, never so aptly summed as: ‘in which nothing happens.

Through Brett’s collection, we encounter his constant curiosity and insight accompanied by a disinterest in a market-led view. In this exhibition, we can experience Brett’s hope and belief in the ability of art to let us begin again.Following an encounter in Paris in 1964 with Brazilian artist Sérgio Camargo (1930- 1990), whose disruption of the monochrome is seen through three works included in the exhibition, Brett became particularly interested in developments in Brazilian modernism. This was solidified by his first visit to Brazil in 1965, aged just 22-years-old, to view the São Paulo Biennial as art critic for The Times. There, he encountered artists including Lygia Clark (1920-1988) and Hélio Oiticica (1937-1980), with whom he formed close friendships and whose international reputations are owed in part to Brett’s rigorous, lifelong advocacy. Both artists are significantly represented in this exhibition: Clark’s rare and playful matchbox constructions, as well as her bichos (creatures) and trepantes (climbers), invite audience participation, as does Oiticica’s Parangolé (1966), an experimental cloak intended to be worn by dancing participants. What drew Brett to the work of artists like Oiticica and Clark was a faith in regeneration, in a creative practice that exceeds the body, that both reflects the conditions of the outside world and suggests that another world is possible.Throughout his career, Guy Brett focused on discovering and exhibiting works that were excluded from Eurocentric art historical chronologies. While the British art world at the time cast their gaze towards white male American Pop art and Abstract expressionism, Brett turned his attention to experimental art movements, particularly those originating from Latin America. In a characteristically trailblazing manner, Brett was one of the earliest champions of pioneering women artists.Brett was integral to the Signals initiative, co-publishing the Signals Newsbulletin in 1964 and helping to establish the now legendary gallery, Signals London (1964-66), which manifested an interdisciplinary approach and brought artists to London from across the world. Brett’s ground-breaking 1990 exhibition, Transcontinental: Nine Latin American Artists (Cornerhouse, Manchester and Ikon Gallery, Birmingham), introduced artists including Cildo Meireles (b.1948), Regina Vater (b.1943), Eugenio Dittborn (b.1943) and Jac Leirner (b.1961) to the UK. The same works by Vater and Leirner that featured in Transcontinental, Vater’s Nature Morte (1987-1988) and Leirner’s The One Hundreds (Signatures) (1987), are shown in this current exhibition. Brett described Transcontinental as encompassing ‘the relation, the tension, between the abstract/void and the contingent, localised, historical, urgent and conflicted’.This exhibition would not have been possible without the collaboration of Alexandra Brett, Guy’s long-time partner with whom he shared his life and built his collection. Alison Jacques is immensely grateful to Alexandra and her daughter, Luciana, for the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to present this historically significant collection. Above all, we are indebted to Guy Brett. We hope this exhibition can play a part in continuing to preserve Brett’s art historical and ever-prescient legacy.",Angel with a Gun: Homage to Guy Brett,"22 Cork Street, W1S 3LZ",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 10 May  - 15 Jun 2024  
Alma,London,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/blckgeezer-black-nausea-24/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",BLCKGEEZER,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/blckgeezer/,"Following the experience of personal illness, BLCKGEEZER expands on and develops an extensive engagement with the writings of Jean Paul Sartre and Franz Fanon importantly shot through the prism of Lola Olufemi’s powerful Experiments in Imagining Otherwise, which the author positions as “a book of failure and mistake; it begins with what is stolen from us and proposes only an invitation to imagine.” The works BLCKGEEZER has produced here begin by invoking powerful themes surrounding maternal instincts to feed and nurture, fertility as well as explorations of mother-child iconography. These paintings then go further to explore ‘Black’ not merely as a form of resistance, but as a material expression of existential persistence and do so with wisdom, wit, rage, humour, and generosity.The concept ‘Black Nausea’ is a term coined by the artist. Black–its associative bond animating the term nausea–creates an uneasiness that offers a transformative state, perhaps even a new trajectory for the lived experience. In the artist’s own words: “I came up with ‘Black Nausea’ after my experience of chemotherapy. It is an ongoing speculation and pillar. I’m thinking about the unease and discomfort of black… I think black nausea is a space for me to think, question, and speculate, there’s no right or wrong.” The painting Barren Cassareep evinces a sense of play echoed in numerous nuances present in BLCKGEEZER’s work. Barren, which connotes infertility, is a play on the word baron–a reference to the Caribbean cooking sauce comprised of black liquid. A key here is the connection between forms and materialities–all that is produced through contact–a sweat that is at once bodily, experiential, conceptual, and existential.Another conceptual neologism BLCKGEEZER has coined is ‘Breastistentialism’. Central to this work is aligning thought and imagination to question existence from a new perspective, one that is otherwise and ‘breast-centred’ and holds everything at stake. The proposition: black, breast, and blackness as abstraction that comes forward as a method and mode–a way of being in the world–to think other than the dominant and prescribed in a nuanced perspective.ABOUT THE ARTISTBLCKGEEZER aka Miya Jazmin Browne (b. 1997) is an artist born and based in London.

Almine Rech,Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/gwen-oneil-over-the-ridges-and-through-the-passes/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Gwen O’Neil,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/gwen-oneil/,"“Over the ridges and through the passes,” Gwen O’Neil’s first exhibition with Almine Rech presents a series of new paintings inspired by unique weather and light conditions endemic to southern California. Like many West Coast-based artists—notably those associated with the Light and Space movement such as Larry Bell, Mary Corse, and Dewain Valentine—O’Neil seeks to capture the combination of natural and artificial factors responsible for southern California’s dramatic environment. Acknowledging that the fiery sunsets and hazy glow associated with Los Angeles are largely the result of air pollution, O’Neil’s paintings are as foreboding as they are dazzling.Channeling painters like Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, O’Neil composes her compositions—typically swirls, curls and waves of intense and varied colors—out of individual daubs of paint. Placing different colors next to each other on the canvas (rather than mixing them on a palette), O’Neil creates hazy volumes that seem to pulsate as we fix on them. Up close, these abstractions, which she bases on natural forms ranging from the tiny spirals inside seashells to massive murmurations of birds, break down into individual marks, like a digital photograph disintegrating into pixels. A constant push and pull between micro and macro perspectives in O’Neil’s work keeps the viewer’s eye coming back to the surfaces of her canvas—as do seemingly errant touches of color that “pop,” instead of blending with the surrounding hues. Unexpected dashes of hot pink or chartreuse, for example, disrupt the illusion of distance or volume. The effect recalls similarly surprising painterly flourishes found in landscapes by Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh or even Joan Mitchell. Similar to the blazing, almost neon orange sun in Monet’s famous Impression Sunrise, 1872, certain aspects of O’Neil’s compositions seem intended to emphasize the materiality of paint itself.In addition to light effects, O’Neil has found inspiration in natural phenomena like starling murmurations and, most recently, the Santa Ana winds. Her paintings translate the dizzying patterns created by thousands of birds flying and swooping into colorful swirling compositions that communicate a sense of awe, but also danger. Stunning though they are, starlings are an invasive species. With this in mind, O’Neil’s paintings can be understood not only as appreciations of the birds’ incredible synchronized configurations, but also as a kind of alarm bell signaling a potential threat to the ecosystem.The works on view in Paris continue O’Neil’s exploration of California’s infamous Santa Ana winds, a likewise duplicitous marvel she has been painting since 2023. These strong winds are the bearer of beautiful clear skies and dry weather, but also have the potential to cause massive destruction. Warm, dry air creates prime conditions for forest fires, which is why Native American tribes have referred to these intense storms as “devil winds.” In addition wreaking havoc on the natural landscape, the Santa Anas are associated with all kinds of strange reactions in humans ranging from physical ailments, like headaches, to psychological ones, like depression and anxiety. In paintings like Canyon Vibrations and Mountain Pass (all works 2024), O’Neil captures both tangible and eerie effects of this force of nature.As an East Coast native who grew up between New York City and East Hampton, O’Neil initially worried she might find California’s lack of seasons perturbing. Indeed, fall foliage, winter snow, spring blooms and summer heatwaves, have been replaced with wildfires, flooding, and sea-level rise. With an acute awareness of her immediate surroundings, O’Neil has developed an artistic practice that documents and raises questions about the effects of human caused climate change on her own backyard. Resonating well beyond, her paintings are deceptively beautiful warnings about the precarity of our planet.— Mara Hoberman, art critic",Gwen O'Neil: Over the Ridges and through the Passes,"64 rue de Turenne, 75003",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 11 May  - 14 Jun 2024

Composed as a temple to eroticism, it explores and universalises the many complex paradoxes of Ishtar, the ancient Mesopotamian goddess of both love and war, as well as fertility and sensuality. As the goddess of paradox, Ishtar is the model of unity in multiplicity.Each of us reflects some of her discordance in ourselves, and this exhibition, Whole Cookie, explores how we strive to gather these conflicting parts into a semblance of order. Ishtar’s polarities and contradictions feed the creative spirit, but they also provoke insecurity and disruption. She represents chaos, going against order and principle, however this also opens up to possibility and potential. The destructive and harsh in balance with the empowering and transformative; society coexisting side by side with the cosmic.Upon entering the exhibition, visitors are faced with the painted image of a sphinx, the guardian of the temple – and its riddle:MINA (reads): ‘Poor is the man whose pleasures depend on the permissions of another’?SPHINX: It’s a Madonna quote. From ‘Justify My Love’... Can we call room service?MINA: Gosh, yes, I remember the video. Rather a Helmut Newton pornographic soiree situation.SPHINX: So sick, yeah. I think I was conceived to that, maybe? (Laughs) In the desert.MINA: Your father was a lion and your mother was an eagle owl— correct?[Excerpt from an accompanying text written by Charlie Fox]In Karkar’s method of seeing others in the show exploring the interaction between humans and hybrid figures. Her gestural work is imbued with colour relationships, as expressed by a vibrant palette in which her bodies are twisted and blended in a dance macabre that evoke the work of Egon Schiele.Ana Karkar’s work is influenced by cinematography and images in the collective unconscious, especially horror and erotic movies. Filmic elements are often noted in her paintings, however for this show, for the first time Karkar is exhibiting film work, in the video piece Queen of the Night in relation to her painting. This then takes its title from a particular terracotta relief from the Old Babylonian period, from Mesopotamia (now at the British Museum).Pervaded by ancient symbolism alongside post-Punk elements and underground culture references, the film tells the story of the divinely complex marriage of Ishtar and Dumuzi and is set to the soundtrack of Berlin-based band Noj remixed to the Witch house genre, in a track titled “Cleopatra’s Nose”.Like an altar, the film is presented as the backdrop to Karkar’s own sculpture of a goddess, subversively titled Queen of the Nightlife, under whose feet is positioned a text written by Karim Massoteau, MY ANGER, A HARROW WITH GREAT TEETH, HAS TORN THE MOUNTAIN APART, folded and marked ‘REUNIFICATION IN PROCESS’. Visitors can take a copy of this text with them as they leave the altar.“Now clad in terror, opening her chest, she demands the destruction of the mountain but is met only with resounding silence.Whiffs of Cypress and Cedar are smelled.Fist clenched, she then summons all life in her body and weaves a storm, fury assembles in her heart, her folds, her veins, her very blood, and lava dribbling from her lips, unleashes the shockwaves of her orgasm all around.She blows one blast of pitiless, pulsing, stroboscopic, energy.”[An excerpt from Karim Massoteau's text]Ana Karkar, via Ishtar, is insisting we face our shadowy contradictions. That we acknowledge who we are, in all our painful and wonderful complexity. At the same time, she steps forward to do the same.------INTERVIEW WITH A SPHINXBy Mina HarkerSPHINX: Did you see my new tattoo, Mina? It tickled.MINA: They’ve just sent some rather fun questions for you... Favourite scent?SPHINX: Cake. So it goes from my wing, around the belly to the top of my tail.MINA (reads): ‘Poor is the man whose pleasures depend on the permissions of another’?SPHINX: It’s a Madonna quote. From ‘Justify My Love’... Can we call room service?MINA: Gosh, yes, I remember the video. Rather a Helmut Newton pornographic soiree situation.SPHINX: So sick, yeah. I think I was conceived to that, maybe? (Laughs) In the desert.MINA: Your father was a tiger and your mother was an eagle owl— correct?SPHINX: You’re so clever, Mina, yeah! And they had me, lucky fuckers. Flew straight from my mum’s belly, looked at my wings in the mirror, cried some diamonds. I am so hungry. I’m phoning for some pancakes.MINA: Was it disturbing, discovering that you weren’t like other girls or boys?SPHINX: Being in a body is always disturbing, nope? It’s a never- ending disturbance. Hormones and growth spurts and mood swings. I guess I should’ve been self-harming in a graveyard, ripping my heart out. Blood always gets me hot, actually. And bones.MINA: If I get too... hot and bothered, I fetch the opium. Did you enjoy Eyes Wide Shut?SPHINX: I mean, I’ve been to those rituals and it was a lot sexier, but, yeah, it’s a great Xmas movie. Well done, Stan.MINA: I enjoy a mask... the mystery.SPHINX: I liked a lot, actually, my body. Having this weird thing nobody else had. Like a rose. And tiger-stripes on my back.MINA: I must confess when I saw a tiger at the Zoological Gardens in London once, I did feel a quiver.SPHINX: Lay the pancakes down there, thank you, baby! Boys are my favourite food, really. You should’ve banged that tiger, Mina! You banged a wolf.MINA: Yes, well, we all have a past. Favourite erotic film?SPHINX: Aw, Forbidden Tales! People are scared of themselves. Scared of what they want. It’s all kind of tragic.MINA: Perhaps the refusal intensifies the urge...SPHINX: Maybe. I think it’s like a big party and being offered swan to eat and then just saying, Oh, I’ll take this feather.MINA: But a swan feather caressed upon a delicate area of flesh is —SPHINX: Like, I broke into this mausoleum with a redhead girl once. Like that Joy Division album cover or whatever? Anyway, she kissed me while we were lying on the slab...MINA: Sphinx, my love! Think of the cadavers, the ghosts —SPHINX: Shut up, they would’ve clapped! That cold marble on my fur. Miaow. And it was so dark in there. Nice and dark and warm.MINA: Houdini’s ghost did visit me once, unstitched my corset. SPHINX: Rather naughty. There’s a jungle growling in my belly. MINA: Forgive my blushes. Celebrity crush?SPHINX: Hunter Schafer: no question.MINA: Do you believe in good and evil?SPHINX: Who came up with that? We need to be pals with our demons and angels and hang out with them and feed each other grapes.MINA: Like a splendid Titian.SPHINX: Yeah? Or more Bacon vibe, maybe. MINA: Favourite body part?SPHINX: On me? Oooh, my wings. I like having someone nestled in there, all cosy. Hold them tight.MINA: On someone else?SPHINX: All of it, especially the earlobe. Mina, come and have some food, please.MINA: Dark honey from the continent! Marvelous. Last dream you had?SPHINX: Ooh, I was looking at this pool of flesh on a marble floor, all red and bloody and sparkling like treasure.MINA: Crumbs. SPHINX: I know.— Charlie Fox, artist, writer and curatorAna Karkar is a French-American artist who has lived and worked in Paris for many years. Karkar draws some of her references from major works of the Vienna Secession. In her paintings of nudes, the bodies are twisted and blended in a danse macabre that evokes the work of Egon Schiele, or are joined in passionate freedom, recalling Gustav Klimt’s iconic painting The Kiss.Karkar’s mastery of gesture is evident in her exploration of the interaction between abstraction and figuration, between humans and hybrid figures. Her work is imbued with color relationships, as expressed by a vibrant palette surrounded with blue that captures the eye of the visitor.The chiaroscuro in her works evokes cinematographic scenes. Her art is influenced by images in the collective unconscious, especially experimental horror cinema. The artist skillfully combines these cinematographic elements with her own artistic language, creating a captivating visual dialogue.",Ana Karkar: Whole Cookie,"Broadbent House, W1K 3JH",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 30 May  - 27 Jul 2024

Your studies of the interplay of human motives and emotion.”— Isaac Asimov, I, RobotAsimov’s seminal story is about the allure and potential ramifications of perfecting humanity through sentient technology—what we now call post-human or transhumanism. And like all of the finest works of science fiction, the book is at heart a philosophical tract. Questioning key assumptions about the nature of life itself, through a discourse with the consciousness of advanced robots, Asimov ultimately queries what it is to be human. For the past four decades, the acclaimed Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama has been asking the same questions.Sorayama’s ongoing Sexy Robots series ponders the alluring, intimidating imaginary of a cyborg human, merging woman and droid, fleshy anatomy and flashy armor, in a cheeky and unsettling continuum from the Hollywood pin-up to the fantastical future. In his finely rendered, sleek and striking mixed media works on canvas—themselves a seamless hybrid of digital and analog mediums—and his iconic sculptural works in steel, Sorayama channels aesthetic visions from Bert Stern to Mel Ramos, Brancusi to Rolls Royce, Egypt to the Oscars.Throughout his decades-long career, Sorayama has seen the world change around him—or rather, catch up with him. His visionary early art practice—as well as his award-winning robotics design work— now seem prescient. But in balance with the narrative and symbolic pull of the futuristic transmogrifications, the materiality of the works and their compositional lexicon complexifies that vector. By drawing on centuries and even millennia-old painting conventions, from mythic maidens and goddesses of ancient Greece and the Renaissance to the glamor photography of Hollywood’s Golden Age and the Barbarella-esque fantasy of the erotic future, Sorayama contextualizes his entreprise within an array of cultural settings. However, he in turn disrupts this legacy with the introduction of digital print and photographic elements, so that the works, in their physical form, embody the same kind of hybridity as his subjects and his ideas.His work is animated by both erotic nostalgia and aspirational futurism. Through acrylic and digital print works on canvas, Sorayama portrays sexualized archetypes of Western feminine beauty and power (Marilyn Monroe, Joan of Arc, Jane Russell; mermaids, goddesses, muses) with an inside-out take on the art history of the male gaze. Call it the sexuality of the singularity, but consider, as the artist does, whether it becomes more or less complex to engage the post-human woman, the cyborg female, as an object of fear and desire?Furthermore, the works ask us to consider the traditional and subverted status of beauty in art and in sexuality—and to what degree beauty even means the same thing to humans and robots.What is more beautiful—the impossibly smooth metal or the softness of plump flesh? The flaws that make an individual, or the attainment of a flawless uniformity? What if the most beautiful being was also the most fearsome—the hybrid, the otherworldly, the both? What if all of this soul-seeking philosophy becomes clouded by the heady rush of physical attraction? When you want them, what do you really want, exactly? What if it’s all a trap?Sorayama lives and works in Tokyo, Japan, his birthplace and where he graduated from Tokyo’s Chubi Central Art School. His time in Hollywood and especially his work in science fiction graphics, became the inspiration for his iconic work, the internationally acclaimed Sexy Robot series, which has been running since 1978. Featured in permanent collections such as the Museum of Modern Art (New York) and the Smithsonian Institution (Washington, DC), he is the rare artist who is equally celebrated by prestigious institutions, fashion houses, erotic publications, as well as the multi-national technology corporations.— Shana Nys Dambrot, art critic, curator, and author","Hajime Sorayama: I, Robot","Broadbent House, W1K 3JH",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 30 May  - 27 Jul 2024

As this movement gained traction, pioneering artists featured in this exhibition drew attention with their paintings full of energetic flashes of color and their physically active means of placing paint to canvas. Artists such as Elaine de Kooning and Helen Frankenthaler, for example, were instrumental to the technical and stylistic developments in this art movement, but were frequently underrepresented in comparison to their male counterparts – and excluded from gallery spaces. Gesture & Form: Women in Abstraction encourages viewers to reconsider the legacy of these women and situates their innovations alongside generations of artists working across the globe.The show highlights the multiplicity that can be found within abstract painting, demonstrating how artists have explored different methods to push the capabilities of the paint medium. With works by Helen Frankenthaler, Vivian Springford, Emily Mason, and Heather Day, viewers will be able to see how the artists activated their bodies to flood canvases with pigment, staining the surfaces with thin layers that swirl over and around each other. These bold washes of color leave traces of their process, and there is a similar effect in the expressive, more gestural works of Elaine de Kooning, Leelee Kimmel, and Jenny Brosinski, which practically vibrate with movement. Each of these paintings embodies the vigorous motion and spirit of artists at work.Further investigations of form can be seen in paintings by Mary Ramsden, Gwen O’Neil, Sarah Crowner, and Selma Parlour. Ramsden and O’Neil’s works demonstrate their considered technique, where dappled strokes introduce textural elements. In contrast to the lyrical forms in O’Neil’s work, Sarah Crowner’s and Selma Parlour’s paintings present geometric compositions that sharply contrast shapes and hues, drawing the viewer’s eye around the image.Beyond exploring material, color and method, this group of artists has also taken inspiration from the world around them. Sasha Ferré and Jemima Murphy reference nature and organic forms in their work, while Minjung Kim and Tia- Thuy Nguyen draw on aspects of their personal identity to incorporate traditional art forms from their respective cultures. Thu-Van Tran’s work is also informed by her heritage, and like Sylvie Fleury and Sylvia Ong, her practice intersects with other visual media and artistic forms to plumb wider societal issues.Now, at a time when figurative art is the trend, Gesture & Form: Women in Abstraction highlights artists who are, at once, continuing to challenge norms while forging careers within a rich and vibrant tradition.— Ferren Gipson, art historian, writer, and textile artist",Gesture & Form: Women in Abstraction,"39 East 78th Street, 2nd Floor, NY 10075",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 3 May  - 15 Jun 2024

Like a goddess lost among humans, she clasped flowers like so many sacred relics, the petals caressing her immense skin with their fragile softness. The flowers, mute accomplices of her voluntary exile, were for her much more than simple decorations. They became shields, fragile ramparts against the ceaseless din of the world. She picked these flowers with infinite tenderness, preserving them intact like watching over a secret. Then, with a delicate gesture, she arranged them in her ears, a border between external chaos and her internal disorder. This ritual was a hymn, a subtle fusion of woman and nature, of order and disorder. Some might consider her crazy, lost in the twists and turns of her own illusions. But, for her, this was a fleeting embrace of the ephemeral beauty of the world. Stopping her ears with flowers was her way of transcending the banality of the everyday, of defying the established order. Thus, in a world where reason seems to have smothered any trace of magic, this giant woman continued to stick flowers in her ears. And maybe, just maybe, her strange ritual would inspire other souls searching for meaning. A tribute to crazy gestures and calm movements that don’t exist in this world, a world that we try by any way possible to make livable. An imagined story.— Inès LongevialThis is not a story that is already over, faded as soon as it has been told, but one of those that infuse the world by being tirelessly replayed.Inès Longevial gives life to a giant, a brute yet fragile force, evoking a repressed desire that is expressed through every stroke of paint. The lines of Cécile Coulon’s poem “My Strength” (1) echo here: “My strength smothers / Those who prevent it / From moving forward,” depicting an internal struggle that is felt in the palpable vigor and energy of the painter’s work. Faced with absurdity, she confronts herself: “My force has no meaning / it has never stopped struggling,” but discovers in her introspection a growing confidence that is in harmony with the world around her: “My strength is having understood the beauty of the mountains.”In the privacy of her studio, this female excess emerges from her brush expressing its own rules and desires. Her eyes marked with melancholy in the first painting, Tulipe noire, gradually look up at others, unrestrainedly revealing a violence, her desire, her sexuality, like a constant transformation, thus embodying the complexity of human passions and unveiling the unsuspected depths of the artistic soul. This is especially evident in her blue painting Le cri, where a naked giantess with the painter’s features shouts not from fear, but from liberation, like a conquering roar. She is faced with witnesses: other facets of humanity caught like a frieze of existence scattered with flowers.In this painter’s enchanting universe, the search for meaning is revealed as a guiding theme that runs through every painting in the exhibition. The solitary giantess “clasping flowers like sacred relics” embodies this aspiration to find a deeper meaning in a world without magic. Her unusual ritual of plugging her ears with flower stems becomes a way of “defying the established order and transcending the banality of the everyday.”Les Silences du Désir also highlights a series of small exquisite corpses drawn during the artist’s time in Spain. These patchworks show the influence of surrealist practices in Longevial’s work. Each drawing is an open window onto the artist’s unconscious, a journey into the twists and turns of the imaginary, somewhere between the real and the fantastic. Contemplating them, the viewer is invited to get lost in a maze of symbols and hidden meanings.— Elise Roche(1) Coulon, Cécile, Les Ronces, Le Castor Astral, 2018",Inès Longevial: Les Silences du Désir,"27 Huqiu Road, 2nd Floor, 200002",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 31 May  - 6 Jul 2024  
"Almine Rech, Matignon",Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/tom-wesselmann-monica-with-wesselmann/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Tom Wesselmann,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/tom-wesselmann/,"""At first, I thought of modeling for Tom as just a job. A starving artist, so to speak, coming to NYC needs some work to support her art, and I was lucky enough to land a job working as Tom Wesselmann’s model. That was the starting point, and it was amazing in itself. Later, I would become an assistant, mixing his paint, keeping his records, helping him manage his clients and his sales, singing his country songs, and being his friend. At first, it was not a steady job, being just the model, but later by adding in studio work, it became my permanent gig. And little did I know I was entering history.I am both a painter and a songwriter so when I started modelling for Tom I was used to having eyes on me, as a front singer in a rock band and modelling for art classes for my fellow artists. There is a kind of synergy that takes place in those situations. You are no longer just you. You are part of a whole experience. The ego subsides, presence appears, and transformation occurs. The other band members plus the audience become part of the whole process; the artist and model become collaborators. You enter into an honest dynamic that is bigger than you.When I met Tom Wesselmann, through my new friend and neighbor Candy Spilner, who was already working for Tom as his solo assistant, I knew that he was famous. But I was also in the limelight, albeit on a much smaller scale, playing shows at CBGB, Peppermint Lounge, Danceteria and all those cool NYC venues. I thought I had made it somehow. That is the innocence or maybe arrogance of youth.Because of the work I was doing, and my naïveté, I took to Tom as a fellow artist. And he let me in as though we were equals. I believe it was this casualness and his humility that made us comfortable together. I didn’t know enough to be intimidated, and he found no need to intimidate me. Looking back, I think he was even intrigued by this very nonchalance on my part. Looking back, I am embarrassed at my boldness.In the 80s Tom was having a renaissance along with a world that was changing. There was something in the air. We all knew it, but when you’re in it, it’s hard to see. NYC was reinventing itself and so was Tom.Tom was very clever as well as creative. He was excited and itching to incorporate his new idea – the development of the laser cut metal pieces. Something about me matched the process. He was already testing this new medium when I arrived on the scene. His wife and favorite model, Claire, was busy raising their children, so Tom was using various other models after her. But he was looking for someone longer lasting. Someone who would represent this new stage of his artistic vision. I became that person.Once, Tom told me that he would’ve met me whether Candy had introduced us or not. In his mind, it was fate.I would arrive at Tom’s studio, and he would hand down the key to me on a fishing pole through his window, knee bent, foot against the window casing, dressed in his khaki corduroys and blue work shirt, his consistent studio work clothes.I will never forget that place, 231 Bowery 2nd floor. It was recently demolished, and now it is only a memory. On the ground floor was Daroma, an Israeli company that sold restaurant equipment. But the building housed other artists, and Tom was on the second floor. After going through the outside industrial door, I would take a walk through the dark, dank, dusty hallway, walk up the steps and enter into the bright lights of a very busy artist’s loft. It was a dream to me, with the smell of oil paint, images everywhere, and an excited stillness. Tom’s everyday worktable that he would use for preparatory work was now set up as a model stand to the right next to the wall. When I first met Tom, I was only posing for portraits. He would ask me to move my mouth this way and that, tilt my head or smile, and he would draw and sometimes photograph my face. There were only a few drawings that came out of these.My real work came when he later asked me to model nude. I was reluctant at first, since we had become friends, so that seemed tricky, but I decided it might be a good job, one that I already knew how to do, and it could fuel my own creativity.So, I said yes, and we committed to our work as artist and model. It would last on and off for many years to come, pretty much until the end of his life.Tom had a Chinese robe for me to wear as I was preparing to model, one that he often used in his work. I never got over feeling nervous when I first took off this robe. There was a choice, either to become naked or to become sacred. I chose sacred, and Tom went along.This space that we entered is very hard to describe. It was charged with a kind of intense yet safe force, and we both sat in that field of intensity and worked. The constant was the flow of country music wafting in the background. The sessions were long, lasting his full workday, and they were tough for the model. There was hard work going on.Sometimes Tom would ask me what I was working on and we would start to talk about art or music. He always wanted to know where we were playing, what I was writing about, what I was painting, what I was doing, although he never came to the gigs. He never went anywhere. He worked and went home. Still, it seemed natural (in hindsight, amazing) that he was genuinely interested in my work. He honestly treated me as a fellow artist as I sat there with him, alone and vulnerable.Although these sessions started out animated, they became quite quiet by the end. And no matter what, I was aiming at making him succeed in his drawing. I was concentrating on that energy between us, trying to keep him interested in his work, drawing a body as though it were supernatural, something meaningful, worthwhile, more than it was. Something that would matter. We were both after something more than a nude woman as seen by a man. It was unspoken, but we both knew. This wasn’t going to be carnal; this would be magical. This would be art, and it would be something new and made in metal. All of this was exciting for him. And it was my job to keep it that way.A whole bunch of drawings would come out in one session. He would churn out maybe 15 drawings each time. I would have to invent four or more new poses for each sitting. And while I would be getting into place he would have a vague idea, recline, sit, or wear this necklace, or just move my arm up or down, head this way or that. I never brought a prop. If there were any other features, a hat or beads, they came from him. Tom was always kind and gentle to me during these sessions. He mostly would exclaim that he couldn’t capture the beauty. Although that was nice to hear, I wanted him to say, “Got it!” So, we kept working. He never said those words, but later on many of these drawings became major works.My time with Tom goes deeper than our work as artist and model. We laughed and painted and visited and sang songs. He was my boss and followed the boundaries, but I knew that he loved me. And I loved him as well. As an assistant he treated me as such, but as a person he thought of me as more than that. It was unspoken but felt.One thing is for sure. He loved that I was a singer. He loved that I wrote songs. That was where I was different, where I became an angel to him. I could sing.""— Monica Serra",Tom Wesselmann: Monica with Wesselmann,"18 avenue Matignon, 75008",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 7 Jun  - 20 Jul 2024

But that word seems uneasy, correct but subtly off. What sort of refinement is this, or elaboration, or even “study”— the anodyne quality of that word is deliberate. Kimmel is outside of fashion: not so much as a whisper of personal experience or life story, no appeal to identity, that skeleton key to all living myths and histories, omnipresent and deader than the Rev. Casuabon’s hopeless attempt to find the key to all mythology. But keeping within the conspectus of the Victorian novel, nothing is more perversely animated, more plastic with eldritch innovation, than what is dead: Dracula, Frankenstein, and a comically replete world of unquiet spirits. Kimmel would be uninterested in pursuing the Matisse idea of art, that beautiful armchair — but no one shirks Matisse, that’s just wrong and rude. But she doesn’t do that trip. Luxe, calme, et volupté — well Kimmel’s paintings have a luxurious quality, even a voluptuous one; but they’re very seldom calm.Kimmel works within a very well known history of postwar painting: Abstract Expressionism. And yet her paintings don’t look much or anything like those produced by First- and Second-generation Abstract Expressionists, the habitués of the Cedar Tavern, the gristle and sinew of the Tenth Street School. For such a stereotypically “masculine” and “tough guy” stratosphere, a lot of the guys underperform as *real men*. Jackson Pollock: a male hysteric with all manner of expressed of repressed and mockingly, amusingly displayed homoerotic “tendencies”. Franz Kline: adorable but likewise a patent mess. That these paragons of Action Painting and The Triumph of American Painting aren’t regular guys is hardly surprising. They’re self-created edifices of compromised, failed, hopeless masculinity if anything, but how vulgar to talk this way. The guys guys in this orchidaceous-hot realm were the women: Lee Krasner and Joan Mitchell, Elaine de Kooning and Grace Hartigan: they all unsex themselves after the manner of early radical feminist Lady Macbeth. Perhaps it’s fitting that among contemporary painters, certain women are their most vital descendants, keeping the shop of the forties and fifties open today and ever young: Julie Mehretu, Cecily Brown, Jacqueline Humphries, Laura Owens, and Kimmel; resisting the vulgar or maybe just way overdone and shopworn identity ideology of making and being. Unsexed. Not having it. Defiantly pissed off.An intense even overwhelming physicality bursts through many of Kimmel’s paintings. Again, love Matisse we really aren’t worthy—but that luxurious armchair or maybe wing chair overbearing and *powerful* to use that stupid word we admit we love. Waves of color, seismic ruptures, tectonic wrecks, tsunamis of pigment, dusts storms: so much weather and often inclement. But naufrage delivers even better sensation in art than paysage bourgeois and The World of Interiors. The Sublime:Both the Sublime and the Beautiful induce a state of submission that is often combined with the possibility of getting lost. They disorientate and undermine purpose. In one of several erotic sections in the Enquiry Burke describes the experience of looking at a beautiful woman’s body: it is, he writes, like a ‘deceitful maze, through which the unsteady eye glides giddily, without knowing where to fix, or whither it is carried.’— Edmund Burke, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and BeautifulAnd from the same:""Whatever is fitted in any sort to excite ideas of pain, and danger, that is to say, whatever is in any sort terrible, or is conversant about terrible objects, or operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a source of the sublime; that is, it is productive of the strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling....When danger or pain press too nearly, they are incapable of giving any delight, and are simply terrible; but at certain distances, and with certain modifications, they may be, and they are delightful, as we every day experience.""— David Rimanelli, art critic",Leelee Kimmel: The Wilds and the Shore,"361 Broadway, NY 10013",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 7 May  - 15 Jun 2024  
"Almine Rech, Tribeca",New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/thu-van-tran-in-spring-ghosts-return/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Thu-Van Tran,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/thu-van-tran/,"Forming the focal point of her exhibition In spring, ghosts return, Thu-Van Tran’s Colors of Grey evokes a world of intense paradox. Vivid hues enact their own negation, their multiplicity eclipsed through their mixing by the emergence of a gray singularity. Differentiation morphs into that which is almost indistinguishable. Begun in 2012 as a poetic reckoning with the so-called Rainbow Herbicides that the United States weaponized against Vietnam during Operation Ranch Hand, the series has taken many forms, from wall-sized frescos to monumental paintings. In her most recent expression, the artist explores expanded vistas on a more intimate scale. These works engage the legacies of Renaissance perspective, 19th- century panoramas, and Christian devotional painting only to subvert them through a meditation on landscape that unfurls across metaphoric and geographical registers.Arranged at the height of windows with a shared horizon line, the paintings in the exhibition offer a 360-degree view onto a compositionally and conceptually complex miasma of colorful abstraction. Their astounding beauty is rooted in horror. Indeed, the gestural washes that veil the canvas belie the steely logic of Tran’s politically encoded color theory. Between 1962 and 1971, the United States sprayed 19 million gallons of chemical weapons onto the jungles of Vietnam. Agent Orange was the most notorious, but Agents White, Blue, Pink, Green, and Purple were also unleashed in an act of chemical warfare that caused decades of ecological and human devastation. Limiting her palette to the colors used to identify these lethal herbicides, Tran paints each color alongside its opposite, gradually producing a shroud of gray pigment that floats above its originally colorful substrate. Her systematic approach results in a painterly negation that poetically figures the trauma of neocolonial occupation. This is a landscape twice abstracted. First, through the familiar gestural marks of nonobjective painting and, second, through the coda waiting to be deciphered in the very colors that Tran initially employs.The resulting panoramic installation that encircles the viewer formally echoes a system of visual representation popularized at the height of colonial expansion. Offering the public an immersive, even cinematic viewing experience, the panorama technique was patented in 1787 to instant acclaim. Visitors flocked to spectacles such as the “panorama du commerce” at the Bourse de Commerce in Paris, where seamlessly fused canvases hung in the round detailed scenes of colonial trade across the French empire. Commissioned to coincide with the Exposition Universelle of 1889, the panorama was a magnum opus of Orientalist painting. Allegories representing each country left no room for doubt as to the hierarchy of civilizations according to the French: Europe was represented as the arts and architecture, while Asia was reduced to elephants and a hookah.Conversely, Tran’s installation works against the panorama’s historical roots in imperialist expansion. Traditional panoramas borrowed a compositional style adopted from military protocols used to survey enemy land. They delivered scenes of heightened realism, typically from a bird’s-eye view. Tran immerses the viewer in a shifting landscape of suggestion and abstraction. Rather than indoctrinating viewers through an illusionistic palimpsest deployed to conceal violent conquest, the artist confronts the perpetual unfolding of imperialist aggression through the enigmatic commingling of color, form, and perception.In In spring, ghosts return, Tran introduces an additional structural element that mitigates the surveilling mode of observation courted in 19th-century panoramas. Interrupting the revolving pan of paintings are two triptychs, whose triple-paneled format borrows from Christian devotional painting. An altar is a threshold to divine mystery. In the Christian tradition, it illustrates the apotheosis toward which all other elements in the church, such as the stations of the cross, narratively progress. Its appearance here is a reminder of forces greater than the visible world and its conquest. This formal intercession in the rhythm of the panorama suggests space for contemplation. The panoramic effect, in turn, exerts reciprocal pressure on the altarpieces, confounding the notion of chronological time fundamental to the Christian worldview. Rather than an explicit narrative mapped onto an advancing timeline, the horizon line that laces across Tran’s panorama suggests a continual cycle akin to the Buddhist belief in reincarnation. In spring, ghosts return reminds us that everything circles back to a point of origin only to begin again.Tran’s incorporation of altars in the form of dual triptychs invites a spiritual dimension into what might otherwise stand as an exercise in history painting. As the exhibition title suggests, there are ghosts in this landscape. Apparitions coalesce and evanesce in the swirling veils of paint, pointing to mourning, mystery, and the possibility of communion. Tran has previously described her preoccupation with “the melancholy of a shifting landscape into which we must project and construct ourselves.” (1) For centuries, Western painting prized various perspectival systems developed in the Renaissance, whose power lay in the promise of projection. These systems relied on the metaphor of the window, placing the viewer in a fixed position relative to the scene before them. A window might provide a view, but Tran’s panorama invites us to choose our own perspective. In this haunted terrain, the act of seeing is also a radical act of reconstruction that forges a future through the vivid condensation of history in the present.— Katherine Rochester, PhD, art historian and curator(1) Hélène Guenin,“Interview: Thu-Van Tran and Hélène Guenin,” in Thu-Van Tran: Nous vivons dans l’éclat, ed.

Among this dynamic list of artists is Michael Craig-Martin. Widely regarded as a pioneering figure of British conceptual art, Craig-Martin’s images expose the tensions between objects and their representations, highlighting the subtle relationships between perception, language, and meaning. Alongside Craig-Martin’s Untitled (violin fragment blue) is Alexander Calder’s Plumbings II, in which kinetic and geometric shapes transform everyday objects into a vibrant existence.YBA artist Gavin Turk will exhibit a highlight of his new series of still-life paintings, depicting today’s quotidian product that serves as a response to a still-life painting by Polish artist Henri Hayden.Another highlight of the exhibition is by Turner Prize winner Keith Tyson, whose artistic philosophy rejects the notion of a fixed self or a singular artistic style. Tyson engages with the work of Roberto Matta, an influential figure in 20th-century Abstract Expressionism and Surrealism from Chile. This encounter between two visionary artists promises to ignite new possibilities and challenge traditional artistic boundaries.Danish artist Tal R, renowned for his exuberant and direct painting style that effortlessly bridges the realms of high art and childlike simplicity, finds an intriguing counterpart in the work of the revered 20th-century Jewish artist: Marc Chagall. Tal R's sophisticated, yet naive approach bears resemblances to the works found within Chagall's iconic oeuvre.Renowned British painter Richard Wathen, known for his fictional portraits that evoke ambiguity, mystery, and a sense of melancholia, responds to an enigmatic work by the Belgian Surrealist artist Paul Delvaux. This encounter between two distinct artistic visions invites viewers into a world of introspection and contemplation.Chinese artist Wen Wu, whose paintings draw inspiration from literature and Asian culture, responds to a painting by the Italian 19th-century artist Vittorio Reggianini. Both works explore similar themes of exploration, wisdom, and elegance.The exhibition also features the vibrant and playful sculptural works of Egyptian-born British sculptor Sam Shendi, who responds to an iconic mother and child sculpture by Henry Moore. Shendi's semi-abstracted style and bold use of colour injects a fresh perspective into Moore's timeless masterpiece.British contemporary artist Von Wolfe skilfully navigates the intersection between traditional oil painting and cutting-edge technological innovations in response to a work by the pioneering Impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir.Emma Bennett, a contemporary artist whose work delves into the themes of time, transience, and fragmented memory, engages with the artistry of Salvador Dali. Zavier Ellis, whose works are informed by historical events and belief systems, responds to a work by Pablo Picasso.Born in London to Chinese parents, contemporary multimedia artist Gordon Cheung blurs the lines between virtual and tangible reality, delving into existential questions about identity, belonging, and territory. Similarly, Tsuguharu Foujita, born in Japan and later a French citizen, explores the same notions. Despite working in different centuries, both artists grapple with these timeless questions in their respective bodies of work.The exhibition also showcases the groundbreaking digital art of multimedia and creative technologist Scott Eaton, responding to the spiritually-charged sculptures of Spanish artist Jaume Plensa. Eaton's innovative approach merges technology and art, creating a dialogue between the digital and tactile realms.Art Through Time: Contemporary Reflections emphasises the significance of contemporary art in today's world and celebrates the evolution of artistic expression. While contemporary artists explore similar subject matters as their predecessors, they introduce new realities, sensibilities, and colour palettes. This exhibition serves as a lens to history through art, reminding us that while the past informs our present, we have made substantial progress, learned invaluable lessons, and now inhabit distinct realities.",Art Through Time: Contemporary Reflections,"27 Cork Street, W1S 3NG",Mon-Fri 9am-6pm, 3 Apr  - 31 May 2024

The show title takes its name from the color pigment used by the artist as a recurring motif in the series Milori Blue 57th Street to depict the skyscrapers that occupy Manhattan’s 57th Street. By taking such real-world matters then abstracting and translating them onto a canvas for exhibition and inspection, Larsen succeeds in re-contextualizing what otherwise tends to be easily disregarded. Consequently, she invents a novel subjective reality––one in which monochromatic structures alluding to silhouettes of buildings dynamically tower over the viewer and dramatically contorting shapes suspend themselves against flat backdrops made up of saturated yellows, oranges, and greens.In the process of constructing her narrative of reality, Larsen naturally invites our participation. Larsen’s anti-representational mode of working enables the artist to effectively displace the subject matter from their origin and the viewer to impart new meanings to the works by drawing upon their personal interpretations and emotional responses. For instance, in Raw Umber X (2023), a brown pillar-like shape stretches diagonally across the linen canvas painted mustard yellow. At first glance, the piece seemingly depicts an urban high-rise hovering over the viewer as with many others created by Larsen. However, closer viewings then give rise to a myriad of possibilities: a chimney peeking out from the rooftop of a suburban home, an elongated shadow imprinted on the ground, an upside-down view of the leg of a wooden chair, et cetera. The search for meaning therefore becomes a unique introspective experience for each individual viewer, with no answer being the right answer.To draw from reality then question and dispute it to make way for something beautiful to emerge––such is the true power of Larsen’s paintings.Liv Mette Larsen (b. 1952) was born in Oslo, Norway. She studied at the Arts and Crafts school, SHKS, in Oslo, and received a Master at UdK in Berlin. Her paintings and drawings are held in private and public collections, among them The National Museum in Oslo, Norway, The Norwegian Council for the Arts, Asker Kommune, Norway, Museum Lüdenscheid, Germany, NBK Berlin, Germany, Colleción Munoz, Spain, Caldic Collection, Wassenaar, Netherland, Fidelity Collection, USA.

She attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and at the Barnes Foundation. In the early 1950’s she moved to New York City where she became friends with many important artists of her generation, such as Al Held, Ronald Bladen, and Willem de Kooning. Before moving to Paris, she had a drink with de Kooning at the legendary Cedar Tavern. He asked her to have dinner with him after her return to New York City, but it never happened. She remained in Paris for almost 40 years, where she met, socialized, and exhibited with artists such as Seymour Boardman, Sam Francis, Shirley Jaffe, and Joan Mitchell. She also knew many recognized European artists such as Alberto Giacometti, Yves Klein, and Sonia Delaunay. Delaunay, who believed in Amaranth’s talent, and strength as a colorist, supported her during her early years in Paris by allowing Amaranth to purchase art supplies on Delaunay’s account. She aided her and her family in many other ways, she was truly Amaranth’s patron.Amaranth perfectly mastered many mediums, creating paintings, drawings, watercolors, sculptures, mosaics, prints, tapestries, scarves, poetry, and writing. She used bold, dynamic brush strokes and strong, vibrant colors as did Delaunay. She named her works by unique, unusual titles, often referring to specific memories, and reflecting the rich, emotionally loaded, dynamic nature of her work.She was breathing and living for art and worked tirelessly. She was a true multimedia artist who worked and created until her final days. Her work has been exhibited around the world and has become part of various important art collections, such as the Women Artists collection at the Mougins Museum in France. As a woman artist belonging to the important school of abstraction, her work is an inseparable part of twentieth-century visual arts.GALLERY 2Ernest Briggs (1923-1984):Ernest Briggs was born in San Diego, California, in 1923. His work from the 1950s can be characterized by loose abstractions and strong, rhythmic brushstrokes. Some of his works cue Still’s influence but he soon moved away from California Abstract Expressionism. Until his death, Briggs moved through various abstract idioms, sometimes returning, and referencing the earlier work. In the 1960s he freely switched between acrylic and oil, creating large canvases characterized by dark, deep colors or lighter strokes, sometimes with unfinished spaces or on unprimed canvas. A few years before his death Briggs simplified his form while still maintaining his wide color palette.He brought out the essence of form with maximal intensity in his works. Briggs passed away in New York in 1984 at the age of 61 from cancer. His works are in the collections of The Anita Shapolsky Art Gallery, The Whitney Museum of American Art, The San Francisco Museum of Art, The Carnegie Institute, The Smithsonian American Art Museum, and other institutions.Seymour Boardman (1921-2005):Seymour Boardman, artistically formed in New York and Paris, before and after WWII, developed and defined his style alongside fellow influential artists like Sam Francis, Larry Calcagno, John Hultberg, and Frank Lobdell. Exhibiting in solo and group shows from the 1950s until his death in 2005, Boardman's paintings can be found in national and international collections.Boardman's paintings can be recognized by an apparent underlying grid that sets the stage for an orchestration of linear motifs that became more and more simplified over the years. Anita Shapolsky highlights the intellectual European starting point of his work that matured and evolved into an almost jazz-like improvisational musical score of the line moving across the canvas.His works are in the collections of many major museums and institutions, such as the Whitney Museum, the Guggenheim, Brooklyn Museum, Santa Barbara Museum of Art and others.Peter Bonner (1964-):Peter Bonner is an Australian Artist, who in 1996 won the Dobell Prize, the highest prize for Drawing in Australia. In his early 20’s he traveled in India, the Middle East, and throughout Europe, and studied drawing and painting in London, Melbourne, and New York. In 2010 he completed a master’s by Research at Monash University pursuing his interest in Perception, Narrative, and the Primitive. He has been influenced greatly by Australian Aboriginal artists, Russian Icons, and the deserts of Central Australia and the American West. Bonner currently lives and works in NYC.Charles Clough (1951-):In 1951, Charles Clough was born in Buffalo, New York. In 1971, he opened an art studio. His paintings are extravagantly colorful and explosively formless.“In the “Clufffalo” paintings is a technique that I began using – my ‘big finger-painting tools’, which has evolved into one I call ‘pour & blots’, which literally describes the technique. I find that by not using brushes I can achieve a novelty of appearance that transcends apex. The joy in making these paintings lies in seeing images and effects that only exist through my particular process. I seek to embody the creative imagination such that it can be thought of as a pseudo-organism from an imaginary universe. I seek atmospheres like Redon’s or Bonnard’s, with pareidolia as in Gorky and Tanguy…I believe I’m inventing a new vocabulary of color/shape”.More than 600 of his artworks are in permanent collections of over 70 museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The National Gallery of Art, and the Smithsonian.Richards Ruben (1925-1998):Ruben painted in a sculptural way. He drew with his stretcher bars, covering them and shaping the canvas to reflect his interest in how the inner rhythms of the image correspond with the outer image of the canvas as well as the canvas's interaction with the wall.His work is in the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, University of Southern California, Pomona College, and University Art Museum, University of California. Over 40 of his paper paintings were accepted into the Menil Collection in 2022.Thomas Sills (1914-2000):Thomas Sills married the mosaicist, Jeanne Reynal. Inspired by her collection of abstract art, he began working with materials that his wife used in her mosaics but soon branched out to oil on wood as well as canvas.Thomas Sills spent most of his creative life in New York City, deeply rooted in the artistic trends as well as cultural issues from the early 1950s to 1970s. Even though he lacked formal training, his self-taught artistic skills released phantasmic abstract paintings. His regular presence in the art world of the 1950s through the early 1970s as an African American painter situated him as an integral element of mainstream and African American art. Thomas Sills, himself however, perceived his art beyond the political; he remained loyal to his commitment to art as a form of expression of the dynamism that escapes any formal constraints.Michael Loew (1907-1985):For more than 30 years, Michael Loew spent his summers in the Monhegan arts community in Maine where he developed from nature to abstraction. While he often used a grid-like, geometrically inspired arrangement, landscapes primarily inspired his work, and his approach was more painterly and expressive. His energetic application of color captured the harmonic luminous effect of light and space. He stated that a painted surface must retain the transparency of a jewel. His work is in numerous museums nationally and internationally, including the Whitney, the Guggenheim, the Hirshorn, and Albright-Knox.Buffie Johnson (1912-2006):Buffie Johnson, born in New York City, studied art in Paris and at the Art Students League. Her earliest works tended toward the Surrealist; then came more abstract canvases of intense color and pure form. In later years, she turned to huge realistic paintings of flowers and other plant forms, which were imbued with texture through their profuse, veiny detail. She is recognized for her exploration of the subconscious and the mystical in her art. Her paintings frequently portrayed dreamlike landscapes and fantastical figures, reflecting her fascination with psychology and the esoteric. She wrote “Lady of the Beast: Ancient Images of the Goddess and Her Sacred Animals” published by Harper & Row in 1988. In the late 1950’s, Johnson was commissioned to paint a huge abstract mural for the Astor Theater on New York’s Broadway, which was well publicized. Johnson consistently aimed to portray divine female power. Her work is in the collections of major museums, including the Guggenheim, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.Jon Schueler (1916-1992):At the CSFA, Clyfford Still introduced Schueler to the work of J.M.W. Turner whose use of light and color to capture the fleeting effects of the sky deeply influenced him. Similar to Turner, Schueler’s skyscapes would blur the line between abstraction and representation using depth and luminosity to capture an emotive record, visualizing his experiences, including those of World War II. After living in NYC, Schueler relocated to Scotland where the ever-changing skies were a source of inspiration as he pursued creating “a painting most like nature”.Schueler saw his work as a means of conveying the emotional and spiritual dimensions of the natural world. Subsequently, he would favor minimal shapes, almost eliminating figuration, allowing for a viewer's personal associations to shape their experience. These “Skyscapes” are the defining aspect of his oeuvre; an exploration of color and emotion, an evocation of nature.Carol Barsha (1952-):Carol Barsha beautifully encapsulates a dreamscape of nature and the world around her. She draws inspiration for her symbolic, sometimes surreal paintings from both imagined and natural phenomena. She aims to explore and capture the beauties of simple and complex structures of the visual world and recreate them. She has been practicing this method since the 1970s and learned from her mentor Phillip Guston.Louise Nevelson (1899-1988):Louise Nevelson was an American sculptor who emigrated with her family to the states from Russia. Using old pieces of wood and found objects, she constructed huge walls and enclosed box arrangements of complex and rhythmic abstract shapes. Examples of Nevelson’s work is in 50 museums including the Whitney and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.James Brooks (1906-1992):James Brooks was an influential American abstract expressionist painter known for his dynamic and gestural style. He initially trained as a commercial artist before transitioning to fine art. His work often featured sweeping brushstrokes and vibrant colors, reflecting his exploration of emotional depth and spontaneity within abstract forms. Brooks' contributions to the abstract expressionist movement earned him recognition as a leading figure in post-war American art.",Living In The Moment Of Abstract Art,"152 East 65th Street, NY 10065",Tue-Fri 11am-6pm, 16 May  - 7 Sep 2024

The results – metaphors for what lies beyond language and the other side of silence – were quieter than my other recent work. By contrast, my White Rock tea bowls were experiments in the very opposite direction. I left nothingness behind me and sought to recapture beauty. Colours gushed into empty white space. I made these more expressionistic tea bowls not in response to Berg but in homage to Takemitsu. His world is one in which a single sound rings out in a white void. In its solitariness it is intensely personal. As it reverberates in the emptiness it draws out a new sound. The sounds hover before merging. Further sounds arise and merge with the others, thereby creating a diffuse, layered sonic structure. Takemitsu’s single sound gradually expands until it echoes throughout the world. It makes one think of blowing wind or seeping water or droplets of rain. Takemitsu’s spirit releases itself from the confines of individuality into time-space. The freedom it finds is ruthless and resolute. Takemitsu’s highly evolved aesthetic is one of supreme serenity and delicacy. It is born of his individual existence pitching itself against and struggling with the world. With my White Rock tea bowls I have sought to fuse my soul with Takemitsu’s unique sound and free myself into a space of unrelenting whiteness.”Raku tea bowls were first made in Japan’s historical capital of Kyoto by a potter named Chōjirō in the sixteenth century. Shaped by hand (rather than thrown) and taken out of the kiln whilst glowing hot, their purpose was for drinking whipped tea (matcha) in the tea ceremony (chanoyu). These monochrome red or black Raku tea bowls were considered radically modern and synonymous with the ideals of wabicha tea ceremonies, with their emphasis on simplicity. Chōjirō is celebrated as the founder and first-generation head of the Raku dynasty of tea bowl makers (chawanya), who have lived and worked in Kyoto since 1586. Raku Jikinyū is the 15th descendant and heads of the Raku family have traditionally taken the first name Kichizaemon when succeeding to the family headship. In 2019 Raku Jikinyū’s son Atsundo became the head of the family and became Raku Kichizaemon XVI.Raku Jikinyū was born in Kyoto in 1949 and studied sculpture at Tokyo University of the Arts, he then travelled to Italy, basing himself in Rome for two years while travelling around Europe. His resolve on returning to Japan was to pursue his own creative interests while working alongside his father, the 14th generation head of the family, to learn the skills of how to make and fire Raku tea bowls.“I have chosen to devote myself to the making of tea bowls. Tea bowls incorporate the unusual sense of space and time of chanoyu in their very forms. However, tea bowls serve a far more profound purpose. Despite the restrictions governing their format, they have the capacity to contain the fervour of the artist’s quest to influence the world and his inner striving … A world where the ritualistic and the ordinary meet, a world situated at the point of contact between the usual and the extraordinary, between reality and non-reality, the inner adventure of the individual leaping towards totality yet remaining within the mundane - such are the strange qualities of chanoyu (the tea ceremony).”The exhibition will comprise 15 White Rock tea bowls and 15 Black Rock tea bowls and occupy the 4th floor gallery space. A fully illustrated catalogue will be published to coincide with the exhibition with new essays by Raku Jikinyū, Dr Rupert Faulkner and David Toop.",Raku Kichizaemon XV Jikinyū: Homage to Alban Berg and Toru Takemitsu,"23 Dering Street, W1S 1AW","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 16 May  - 6 Jul 2024

In the process of its appearing, the outside world becomes a little more tactile. Sounds, tastes, memories, stories, etc are moving back and forth between insides and outsides of myself, then gradually a certain form gets shaped, that could be sudden sometimes. After it simply fades away, disappears, then an impression of the experience remains. This impression could also have its time and form.... I think music and sculpture for me are the flow of these.”Air Recycle is a unique installation created by Nakajima on our 3rd floor gallery space specifically for this exhibition. Her working process is intuitive and improvised with different objects taking on their own characteristics, often randomly, and in reaction to each other. In her works, Nakajima incorporates many found and reclaimed materials including paper tubes, buttons, strings, tin, sticks, bicycle tubes, lids and jars, steel wire and electronics to power them. She envisages motors rotating papers, scratching walls and hitting steel wire, others rotating metal sticks that ring against bottles, pencils and sticks that hit and draw on walls or objects with fast, slow and soft movements. The direction and nature of the work is not pre-determined but sound is always a key element in responding to the space and interactions of her materials. Whether these compositions are across the floor, wall-mounted or freestanding, Nakajima’s installations spontaneously emerge, comprising a multitude of individual yet connected components.Nakajima refers to her work as both sculpture and music, both are central elements in her work with some projects focussing more on music and sound art and others more on sculptural pieces. In 2023, Nakajima performed with Pierre Berthet in Milly-la-Forêt in France, on the site of Jean Tinguely’s sculpture Le Cyclop. “I don’t care much for what is art or music... It’s just a situation. If I’m in a musical context – a concert or festival – I gather information from my past and try to make something more interesting than before”. Nakajima sees her work in terms of accumulated knowledge that is collected over time with improvisation being an opportunity for this knowledge to express itself.As part of the quartet O YAMA O, Nakajima has performed frequently at Café Oto - an EastLondon venue synonymous with experimental music and sound art - with its co-founder Keiko Yamamoto whom she met at Chelsea College of Arts. O YAMA O’s improvised performances combine Yamamoto’s singing – touching on subjects derived from Japanese folklore and domestic life – with Nakajima’s kinetic objects. Nakajima summons delicate textures out of her objects, slowly shaping the music into what appears to be a choreographed crescendo but is in essence a largely improvised ritual.In his essay ‘Trembling Between States: Rie Nakajima”, David Toop, another collaborator of Nakajima, writes: “Where we listen; how we listen. These two elements form a sculptural reality in relation to the object of sounding. The object of sounding is indifferent. There is its place in a room but when listening begins there is no object, no room - only the sculptural reality created by the listener.”Rie Nakajima studied at Tokyo University of the Arts, Faculty of Fine Arts, Aesthetics and Art History Department in 2000, then in London at Chelsea College of Arts BA in Fine Arts in 2002 at Chelsea College of Arts in London, and an MFA in Sculpture at the Slade School of Art in 2007.Her first major solo exhibition was held at IKON Gallery in Birmingham in 2018. She has also worked with Museo Vostell Malpartida (Cáceres), Association de Le Cyclop (Milly la Forêt), ShugoArts (Tokyo), Donaueschinger Music Festival (Donaueschinger), and Cafe OTO (London). Her collaborations have included working with Pierre Berthet, David Cunningham, Keiko Yamamoto, Miki Yui, Hans.W.Koch, Marie Roux, Akio Suzuki + Aki Onda Billy Steiger, David Toop and Akira Sakata amongst others. Public Gallery projects and exhibitions have included Museu de Arte Moderna, Rio de Janeiro; Embassy of Belgium and Hara Museum, Tokyo; Kunsthaus Wiesbaden, Germany; Serpentine Gallery, Tate, Camden Art Centre, Southbank Gallery, London. She has also contributed to multi-media collaborative works online including music and video.",Rie Nakajima: Air Recycle,"23 Dering Street, W1S 1AW","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 16 May  - 6 Jul 2024

From this POV, it’s as if the ultimate paradigm of our individuality our face—has been stripped of any currency at all. But perhaps there’s something else of value in the anonymous swarm intelligence of a post-facial future?At ANNKA KULTYS GALLERY in London, Austrian artist Christiane Peschek presents The Girls Club, a suite of digitally-manipulated selfies that reflect the uncanny powers of a femme face that refuses recognition. Thirteen meticulously-crafted hand-dyed silk works mounted to aluminum frames are enshrined by a black vinyl wall installation that bears the phrase “The Girls Club”. The images, which are all characterised by deep-fried edits to a series of self-portraits taken on the artist’s iPhone, collapse the face into an abstract field of material data, one that can refuse the superstructures of capital and identity that augured it.“Using silk as a carrier for my images is a reference to the human skin,” Peschek explains in an interview. “Its fragile and delicate characteristic is a beautiful contrast to the hard surface of the touchscreen.” With a background in advertising, the artist has a keen understanding of material driven affect, even while her work takes aim at larger social, cultural, and technological systems that underpin the consumption of images online. With The Girls Club, an ongoing project since 2019, Peschek focuses on the eternal quest for self-presentation within virtual social environments. Drawing on photo editing and retouching tools, Peschek merges her own selfies with an ever-expanding archive of imagery culled from various social media feeds.Like many synthetic intelligence models including the generative adversarial networks (GANs) utilised to generate deepfakes—a digitally manipulated media that replaces one person with the likeness of another—Peschek’s girls are iterative, emerging from a source image that has been modified hundreds of times. The source image in question is the selfie; yet blurred beyond recognition, identity fractures and splits into multitudes.In Peschek’s hands, the selfie becomes less a projection of the self than an abstracted “internet gaze” and a critique of the algorithmic beauty systems that undergird it. Aesthetically, Peschek’s work is something of a paradox: the soft and gauzy imagery belies the aggressive bordering on obsessive treatment of the image, often spawned from pushing an editing tool to its extreme by reapplying it up to a hundred times. In this militant spiral, a popular blurring filter—typically used to conceal blemishes and other imperfections—first enhances the beauty of the face before annihilating it altogether in a wash of abstraction. Here faces are atmospheres, split into their melted composite parts. Mouths appear as gargantuan grimacing slashes: Cheshire cat-like, sinister. Eyes are always shut and often flattened. Very rarely does a baseball hat or some other accessory enter the scene. The rest of the face evades perception, becoming landscape.Enshrined by these digitally-rendered mutations and variations of the self, Peschek’s girls club is partially a series of self-portraits; equally depersonalised, the girl in question here is also all of us. This ideology echoes the argument of theorist Alex Quicho, whose essay “Everyone is a girl online” charts a new politics of “being girl”. Here, girl as collective consciousness (colloquially known as ‘girlswarm’) is both a recognition of the interlocking axes of power, desire, and capital laminated onto all of us (cis men, too, you’re also girls), and a polyvocal war cry for something beyond.Within her practice, Peschek talks about the phenomenon of “becoming image”—this notion follows Quicho’s girlstack, where one may sub for the techno-armageddon in order to collapse the system from inside it. Returning to Olsson’s peak face, the author suggests that perhaps “defacing” the world may be a chance to rescue ourselves from the financialized weapon suite of the facial platform. Likewise, with the infinitely expanding swarm intelligence of Peschek’s The Girls Club—flattened icons who evade their own humanness as much as they reject the financialisation of e-femininity—we see a similar spirit of refusal.“Soon, we might be able to look in the mirror and ask ourselves, earnestly, ‘Do we really need this?” Olsson proclaims his vision of a post-facial future. Peschek’s girls critically anticipate that mirror stage; these “supra-individual” portraits refuse the notion of the bounded self as much as they reject the genre of portraiture, ultimately delivering an exit strategy from the superstructures that got us here in the first place. To become unrecognizable is also to become ungovernable; to become girl, in Peschek’s distorted photographic image, is to become an edgeless swarm that critiques its confines while imagining worlds beyond representation.ARTIST INFORMATIONChristiane Peschek is an artist broadly interested in questions of identity and aesthetics online. Since 1996, she has maintained an archive of selfies that are directly utilised in her work and can be understood as the backbone of her creative practice. Spanning painting, printmaking, sculpture, and multisensory installation, Peschek’s practice skewers the historical weight of the portrait genre, subjecting it to the ebbs and flows of digital production, optimisation, and curation of the self as the ultimate currency. Drawing on digital retouching and editing tools, as well as the intimacy of the interface, Peschek’s practice critiques the fantasy of these online representations while also speculating on a world where the commercialisation of online identity can be eluded through the glitch and blur.Born in 1984, the artist studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. She has shown internationally at galleries and institutions such as ANNKA KULTYS GALLERY, Kunstmuseum Celle, the NRW Forum Düsseldorf, Museum MARTA, U10 Belgrade, UNSEEN Amsterdam, Salzburger Kunstverein and Benaki Museum Athens.Peschek was awarded with several international prices such as the UNSEEN Tesla Art Trail award, honor price of Emergentes DST and the state scholarship for photography by the Austrian Government.Her works are found in collections such as ING DiBa Art Collection, the Museum of Modern Art Salzburg, the Artothek at Belvedere21 Vienna and the Kupferstichkabinett Vienna.",Christiane Peschek: The Girls Club,"472 Hackney Road, Unit 9, E2 9EQ",Wed-Sat 12-6pm, 31 May  - 27 Jul 2024

They start in the midst of an action and end in the midst of the same action, or at a slightly different phase of that action — rain, or perhaps drops wind-blown from a tree, fall onto a puddle; water flows and ebbs over sand; a sunlit toilet paper roll’s end sheet flutters; a bit of icy slush slides on a shiny hard surface. Some of the videos are less like the others: falling snow and tangles of snow covered trees are filmed from a quickly moving vehicle.Liquid in motion and reflected light are recurrent themes. The action mostly takes place on a small, friendly scale — the changing light on a curtain or the shadow of a hand turning a pair of glasses and creating light play on a wall. Sound appears to be ambient, from the environment of the action. People’s voices and laughter can be heard in the background as the camera remains focused on the reflection of a building on the moving surface of white wine in a glass. But people are not directly filmed, and the closest the viewer gets to seeing characters is a small group of brightly colored tropical fish swimming back and forth in a contained environment–perhaps the denizens of a small aquarium tank.Mari’s title for the series, ‘Daily Discovery of Present Moment,’ suggests a practice and an approach. The videos themselves become less filmic aesthetic representations and more records of the ‘daily discovery’ — of the artist appreciating the changes in the visual manifestation of actions of the incidentally quotidian. The ‘present moment’ reflects a philosophical position that not only puts focus on the present but may only allow for the present. In considering A-theory of time (tensed time allowing for the past, present, and future) and B-theory of time (untensed time which is always described in the present tense), the viewer notes that Mari’s imagery more shows evolving and devolving states than cause and effect. Each video is a glimpse of an eternal present endlessly unfolding.Movement of water and other repetitive action at first lull the viewer, but then the complexity of the action in the videos begins to announce itself. As the viewer slows pace and heightens attention to better comprehend Mari’s documentation, they might be reminded that there are 64 moments in a finger snap. There might be a realization that the vital, vibrating life force of the world seems to be roiling just under the surface of these presentations of light and sound. The viewer may further understand that the reason for not paying attention to the mundane actions of the world is not because they are boring but because they contain too much information for a person to absorb — viewing becomes overwhelming, anxiety creeps in. But maybe, then, the function of these videos is not to slow time or lead the viewer either towards or away from existential despair, but for the viewer to take these briefly documented actions proposed by Mari as short rituals that allow for communication with deeper, unseen, uncomprehended forces. Present-1 shows, only through documentation of cast shadows, a hand agitating the surface of some water — the agitation becomes more pronounced as the video progresses. Here Mari explicates a deeper intention and reveals through allegory the rare ritual of the body reaching through the membrane of the real to negotiate with the spirits that invisibly surround us and control our world from just out of sight.”Mari Lee (b.

Artist Room,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/leonardo-devito-tired-city/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",The Artist Room,https://www.galleriesnow.net/gallery/the-artist-room,"It’s difficult to imagine ever getting used to living in a city like Florence. A city where one can walk to Piazza del Duomo and see Giotto’s Bell Tower rising from the ground, or walk alongside the river Arno as the warm sun shines on the Ponte Vecchio. A city where the museums house paintings by Botticelli, Caravaggio, and Raphael as well as sculptures by Bernini and Michelangelo. A city where almost every corner is a feast for one’s eyes. For Leonardo Devito, this was his everyday reality while he grew up immersed in Florence’s rich artistic history.“I didn’t look at contemporary art when I was studying at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence,” Devito tells me from his Turin studio, as he prepares himself for a trip to the Venice Biennale the next day. “I looked at what was around me. Artists working at the beginning of the Quattrocento like Fra Angelico and Piero della Francesca helped form my thinking. They have become ever present in my work, almost part of my subconscious.” In Rogo [Fire] (2024), one of Devito’s paintings on view in Tired City, his second solo exhibition at The Artist Room, a man is splayed on the ground, sleeping while appearing to ignore the burning city behind him. Devito’s use of strong shadows and harsh corners echoes the convergent perspectives used by artists from the Renaissance like Giotto to render the perspective of the city. “I don’t do this on purpose,” he observes. “Sometimes, I only realise after I finish a painting that what I was making recalls a certain image that I may have seen in the past, a hidden memory from earlier in life.” The man in Rogo [Fire] is wrapped in a blue sheet, with a soft, darker fabric covering his eyes. After finishing, Devito noticed a connection with Giovanni Bellini’s Drunkenness of Noah (1515) . Differently, I couldn’t help but connect the detailed folds of Devito’s blue fabric with the sculpted marble drapes that wrap the statue of St. Cecilia (1600) by Stefano Maderno in Rome, or the marbled veil covering Giuseppe Sanmartino’s Veiled Christ (1753) in Naples. “It becomes natural for me to get closer to that type of image, one that faintly recalls elements of the Renaissance, the Baroque, or of Italian art history in general. I guess it’s ingrained in me,” Devito adds.“I’m very interested in how artists from the 20th century have reinterpreted the Renaissance, like Felice Casorati, Giorgio de Chirico, and Mario Sironi,” Devito says. “In my practice, I seek a similarly malleable way of creating imaginary worlds that subtly hint at the artistic and architectural landscapes of the past.” While Devito may be reminiscing on the romantic Florentine Renaissance and looking at Italian artists from a more recent past, the paintings featured in Tired City also thread directly into the present through their relation with his own personal experiences. The journey of his exhibition begins with the painting Demiurgo [Demiurge] (2024) which depicts a child holding a leafless tree enclosed within a circular box. “In elementary school, I remember spending lunch breaks with my friends building houses where little gnomes would live,” Devito recollects. “We’d find sticks, put them on the ground, make some holes, and play together pretending that these little gnomes did this and that.” With the tree close to his heart, the boy in Demiurgo [Demiurge] is wrapped in the little world he holds, disregarding the infinite horizon in the background with its mountains, ocean, and rising sun. When asked if the gnomes were actual toys, Devito laughs and says, “No, we’d pretend they existed. It was a moment of shared fantasy creating an imaginary city.” The title of the painting, Demiurgo [Demiurge], stems from the philosophical figure of the ‘demiurge’, the divine artisan and shaper of the universe, first introduced by Plato in Timaeus. Just like the boy in the painting is the demiurge of the little world he holds on to, Devito is the demiurge of the imaginary cities populated by gnomes he and his friends would create at school, and today, of the world he constructs in his practice. Painting by painting, Devito takes us on a journey through a semi-imaginary world, materialising it through the perspective of a child growing up.In Primo Giardino [First Garden], more trees seem to have grown in the enclosed city and are no longer without leaves; yet, they are all translucent and protected by three similarly sheer and small beings standing at the bottom of the frame. “I added those little characters to make the painting less solemn – more playful and whimsical,” Devito explains. “They’re kind of like the little toys you’d find in Kinder Surprise Eggs.” The existence of the three mystical Kinder beings is subtle, because they are shadowed by the imposing cement-like grey walls enclosing the world of trees. Yet, playful references to his childhood experience don't end here. In Tardo Pomeriggio [Late Afternoon] (2024), two teenagers are pictured sitting on a bench, one holding a deck of cards, the other is wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with a faded drawing of a urinating child. Upon closer inspection, the brown spiral on the reverse of the cards recalls Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Cards and the urinating kid recalls the unlicensed Calvin peeing drawing popularly plastered across T-shirts and on cars in the noughties. Devito hints at the specific yet shared playful experience of growing up in the early 2000’s through these details. He brings them in stark contrast with the river that dramatically curves into the horizon with the factory standing behind the adolescents. “It's similar to the factories near my house in the peripheries of Florence,” Devito says. The clash between the factory’s smoke and playful childhood ephemera heightens the nonchalant expressions of the boys as they sit staring blankly at whatever stands in front of them, beyond the frame.A discomforting sensation seems to loom over Devito's paintings through the expressions of his protagonists that collide with what's happening around them. ""I don't like when an image is clearly joyful or clearly sad,"" he adds. ""There has to be a clash between emotions. When that happens, there's an ambiguity that leaves room for something more interesting to be revealed."" This is evidenced in paintings like Ricreazione [Recreation] (2024), where darkness takes over children while playing what's meant to be a fun game during their lunch break. Devito's imagined city becomes an alternate universe where worlds seem to collide.“It's interesting when things from the past find themselves in places that have nothing to do with them, like Derek Jarman’s film Caravaggio (1986),” Devito explains. In the film, Jarman envisions a fictional narrative of the painter’s life including scenes of Caravaggio smoking cigarettes among other contemporary elements that couldn't have existed during his lifetime. Yet, these inclusions are subtle, brief, and don’t feel out of place. “I’m intrigued by this type of collision,” Devito tells me. In Assedio [Siege] (2024), he paints little soldiers shooting rifles to defend a mediaeval castle. The soldiers should feel intrusive and yet, they don’t – they seamlessly integrate with the dramatic scene where a young boy wearing contemporary clothing is about to crash a ship into the castle that they are protecting. The temporal eras from which the soldiers, castle, and boy originate no longer matter in Devito’s surreal whimsical world. Like a frozen snapshot, the focus shifts to impending action.Growing up in Italy, imaginary worlds often crash with reality. “There’s a constant tension between the present and the past in Italian cities, and the permanence of things,” Devito muses. “Genoa’s intrusive cavalcavia for example, the overpasses that cut through the city’s beautiful urban architecture; or Rome, with its construction sites near the Colosseum – one minute, it’s completely frantic, and the next, you are in front of beautiful ruins.” Devito’s Tired City feels like an extension of the Italian city itself, clashing elements that materialise in real life simultaneously form part of a surreal, imaginary world that has been conjured up in Leonardo’s mind growing up as a young boy in Italy. “Connecting these two opposing dimensions, the contrast between modernity and antiquity, plays into a beguiling, fascinating world,” he concludes.Drawing the title of his exhibition from Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities (1972), Devito blends the real with the fantastical, proposing an alternate world where growing up may not necessarily mean living in a more cynical environment. Similarly to how Calvino takes the real historical figure of Marco Polo to imagine cities in Kublai Khan's empire, Devito bridges how Italian history has been conceived in our collective memories with his contemporary personal experience to construct the Tired City.Since moving to Turin in 2020, where he is now surrounded by contemporary art, Devito's Tired City becomes a project of looking back, a coming together of collective memories, fictional fantasies, and lived, personal experience. “All of life seems to be rich and full of possibilities when you’re a child, all beautiful, joyful, and infinite,” Devito says. “Then you grow up and all that fantasy seems to catch on fire and disappear.” The journey across the Tired City ends with Bobi fa pipì [Bobi Pee] (2024) where two older men look over the wall to see the last few remains of their imagined city. The only thing left is a barren tree with a black dog cheekily urinating on the wall beside it. “There are bound to be a few remains of the purity of childhood and adolescence that still exist deep down in these two figures,” Devito reflects. They’re no longer as nonchalant as they were while watching children build their city, or as bored as they were when they were teenagers watching their city burn. Instead, their facial expressions have been replaced by dramatic shock. All it took for their indifference to disappear was for them to grow old and for a dog to foul within the walls of their imagined city.Text by Sara Quattrocchi Febles.",Leonardo Devito: Tired City,"20 Great Chapel Street, W1F 8FW","Wed-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 12-5pm", 31 May  - 29 Jun 2024

Showcasing some of his iconic 1960s photographs, his impeccable fashion and advertising images, as well as powerful photo-essays documenting life in London, personal projects and nudes, this exhibition reveals an unexpected range of work from one of the foremost photographers of his generation.Exquisite and rare, signed life-time and vintage prints, unique 6x6cm contact prints and numbered silver gelatin estate prints are on display and available to collectors. A selection of rarely seen abstract black and white paintings inspired by Japanese calligraphy will be exhibited alongside his photographs for the first time.Born into a working class family in East London, Donovan was fascinated by photography and printmaking from an early age. His professional photographic life started at the age of 11 with an apprenticeship at the London School of Photo-Engraving. He left at 15 to become a photographer’s assistant before opening his own studio in 1959 at the age of 22. He was immediately sought after by a range of clients, including leading advertising agencies and fashion and lifestyle magazines of the time, including Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar and Elle (France).Part of a working class influx into the previously rarefied worlds of fashion, media and the arts, Donovan’s iconoclastic and sometimes irreverent photography established a new visual language rooted in the world he knew best – the streets of London’s East End. Taking his models to bomb-ravaged wastegrounds or balancing them off industrial building sites, his gritty and noir-ish style was more like reportage than fashion photography.In the 1970s Donovan concentrated more specifically on advertising photography and moving image work but the late 1980s and early 1990s marked a return to stills photography, revisiting black and white film, his preferred medium during the early years of his career.A selection of unique, vintage silver gelatin contact prints are also on display. These small photographs are made by laying the negative directly onto the surface of the light sensitive paper. Terence Donovan was known for meticulously reviewing his contact sheets, indicating his selected frames by piercing them with a pen or marking them with a chinagraph pencil. He discarded the contact prints of the frames he did not want used, keeping only those that he felt good enough to print or publish.These small, original contact prints of single frames (some more than sixty years old) were kept with his negatives and remain in his archive. They tell the story of their history, bearing crop marks, printing instructions or layout comments. As well as being beautiful objects in their own right, they present an important insight into Terence Donovan’s working process and provide information about which shots he felt were most successful from the many hundreds of thousands of photographs he took.Donovan was at the heart of a British fashion photography movement that exploded onto the scene in the 1960s. A unique set of nine vintage contact prints depicting fellow photographers and artists will also be on view. This exceptional series of nine prints captures major figures in British photographic history who were not only Donovan’s professional peers, but also close friends.This group of nine will premiere on our booth (G15) at Photo London (15 - 19th May 2024).Terence Donovan photographed many artists, models, singers and actors, from Jimi Hendrix, to Twiggy, to Cindy Crawford, to Stella Tennant. Gifted with an unerring eye for the iconic as well as the transformative, Donovan was a master of his craft, who pushed the limits of what was possible with a camera.In 1960, Terence Donovan was commissioned by Tom Wolsey, the renowned Art Director of ‘Man About Town’ magazine (subsequently ‘About Town’ and then ‘Town’) to do a photo-essay on an artist’s co-operative in the then run-down area of Notting Hill: The Lay About Life. This influential photo-essay exemplifies a lesser known aspect of Donovan’s oeuvre, away from the glamour and bright lights of the world of high fashion. It demonstrates his particular visual sensitivity and ability to empathise and immerse himself in other people’s lives.Despite his famously wide-ranging and diverse interests, Donovan’s passion for photography remained undiminished throughout his long career. Early in his career he told a young Jean Shrimpton:‘Photography fascinates me. Instant fascination every time. When the fascination leaves me, I’ll give it up.’In his later years, Donovan developed a love of painting and created vast abstract canvases, some of which are inspired by Japanese calligraphy. A selection are shown alongside his photographs at the Gallery.","Terence Donovan: Full Frame, Photographs & Paintings","49 Dorset Street, W1U 7NF","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 24 May  - 7 Sep 2024

She raises critical questions – where does knowledge lie? Who and what is classified? – joining together the threads of dissociated knowledge systems.The evocative photographs at the core of Digital Clouds Don’t Carry Rain are set amongst the dying trees of Derbyshire, home of the Industrial Revolution. In these self-portraits, the artist mimics poses from 18th-century Casta paintings, a genre of art that was used in Spain to illustrate colonial, racist social hierarchies – classifying mixed race individuals within a ‘caste’ system.Attempting to make complex power structures visible, Alcázar-Duarte intervenes in her photographs. Masks covered in flowers reference both the emblems of empire and plants that are vitally important to endangered bees in the Yucatán. Copper appears throughout the works, a material extracted from Mexico under Spanish colonial rule which today continues to be used in cables as a carrier for the internet globally. Patterning formed by datasets scanned from the faces of the Casta paintings are juxtaposed against the fleur-de-lis: a symbol of the lily connoting monarchy and virtue, which was also used during the colonial era to mark enslaved people as a punishment.These photographs appear alongside a short film U K'ux Kaj / Heart of sky, Mayan god of storms (2023-24), produced at Maní in the Yucatán Peninsula, the town where the Mayan codices were burned in 1562. Rooted in the centre of the exhibition is a new installation T'aabal chukChuuk / Embers (2024). Using an algorithm inspired by the collective intelligence of bee colonies, Alcázar-Duarte merges the fleur-de-lis with fragments from the Casta paintings. The resulting fifty-six 3D printed lilies form a garden of technology based in historical classification systems, activated through augmented reality.The artist reflects: “I find myself wondering if there could be different approaches to tackling the important questions of our time…how is it that the knowledge of my ancestors has been completely disassociated from contemporary knowledge systems?”",Mónica Alcázar-Duarte: Digital Clouds Don't Carry Rain,"Rivington Place, EC2A 3BA","Wed & Fri 11am-6pm, Thu 11am-9pm, Sat 12.30-6pm", 16 Feb  - 1 Jun 2024

Drawing on historical and personal archives, ecology politics and indigenous environmentalism, his work demonstrates how artmaking can be used as a tool for social empowerment and to confront continued, aggressive colonial practices.Once a major producer of palm oil for British colonisers, the Niger Delta is considered the mainstay of the Nigerian economy for its large oil reserves and its rich biodiversity due to the presence of rivers, mangroves, freshwater forests, and marine estuaries. In recent years, the region has been at the centre of environmental and social justice campaigns, challenging the pollution caused by major spills and flares at the hands of oil and gas industry giants.The works in the exhibition are all set in the Niger Delta, Ukpong’s homeland. Driven by a profound desire to effect change, the artist worked with more than two hundred young people from marginalised, oil-producing communities to collectively address the historical and environmental issues in the oil-rich region. The resulting photographs and film powerfully reference local rituals, ceremonial motifs, and symbols interwoven into a complex future cosmology.Ukpong reflects, “Community history, ecology politics, indigenous environmentalism, extractive capitalism, and cultural evolution, these meditations on my homeland demonstrate how the art and filmmaking process can be employed to promote youth empowerment, challenge colonial narratives and disrupt systems of knowledge production.”Through a futuristic lens, Ukpong underscores the need to understand the detrimental impact of this extreme extraction on both people and land.",Wilfred Ukpong: Niger-Delta / Future Cosmos,"Rivington Place, EC2A 3BA","Wed & Fri 11am-6pm, Thu 11am-9pm, Sat 12.30-6pm", 16 Feb  - 1 Jun 2024

Although she left for the United States in 1955, she eventually divided her time between Paris and California. Untitled (2014) is characteristic of Adnan’s abstract landscapes created using a palette knife. These works suggest the shape of Mount Tamalpais near Adnan’s home in California – an object of fixation that she compared to Paul Cézanne’s relationship with Mont Sainte-Victoire.The interwar Paris that Alexander Calder encountered in 1926 was the epicenter of the avant-garde. It was in Paris that Calder developed his signature ""mobiles’ in 1931 and his first ‘stabiles’ the following year. When he returned to the United States in 1933, his artistic identity was formed. Untitled (1940) is a dramatic example of Calder’s stabiles that recalls the suggestive formal vocabulary of his friend Joan Míro while exemplifying the equilibrium and playful biomorphism that characterizes Calder’s mature work.With proceeds from the G.I. Bill, Ed Clark arrived in Paris in 1952 and remained for four years, becoming central to a group of abstract painters and African American intellectuals. During this period Clark began what he called ‘the big sweep’: his signature technique of using a push-broom to apply paint. In Untitled (1984) he reinterprets the oval forms that had been central to his pioneering series of shaped canvases in a work that epitomizes his unique approach to color.After first visiting Paris in 1948, Joan Mitchell returned frequently before finally relocating permanently to France in 1959. In Untitled (1983) a rectangular field of blended blue pigment covers the page, revealing only hints of pink and yellow and black gestures. Mitchell here approaches pastel – a medium often associated with delicate sketches – as a tool for gestural bravura. At the same time, her palette and her use of pastel recall the French Impressionist landscapes which influenced her visual approach after her move to France.Ad Reinhardt was an avid traveler throughout the 1950s and 1960s, keeping extensive journals detailing art and architecture. His relationship with Paris was solidified by his 1960s solo show Mysticisme athée at Galerie Iris Clert. Painted several years earlier, Reinhardt’s Number 11 (Flowers) (1949) is an outstanding example of his early exploration of calligraphic gesture and romanticism.Additional artists will include: Louise Bourgeois, John Chamberlain, Beauford Delaney, Ellsworth Kelly, I.

Campos-Pons explores themes of identity, race, gender, diaspora, and spirituality in her work, impulsed by her transcultural Nigerian, Chinese, and Spanish heritage.With an artistic career spanning over four decades, María Magdalena Campos-Pons returns to Berlin with her second solo exhibition at Galerie Barbara Thumm, featuring two new paintings, video pieces, and an installation with porcelain vessels. The exhibition offers insight into the construction and expression of the artist‘s concept of identity, interconnecting multiple religious, spiritual, and geographical factors. In her repertoire, Campos-Pons draws from her personal experience to narrate the process of identity construction, from her own exile moving from Cuba to the United States, as well as her ancestors’, who arrived to the island from Africa and China. Her oeuvre interweaves personal experiences that tackle universal and collective ones at the same time, addressing historical themes such as the African and Chinese diaspora in the Caribbean. Campos-Pons uses her art as a medium for storytelling, engaging all senses through her performances and installations, always guided by her conviction of art’s healing power.As a result of the invitation to participate in the 2008 Guangzhou triennial, Campos-Pons began investigating her Chinese ancestry and including it in her art. She created the installation “My Mother Told Me I Am Chinese: China Porcelain” (2008) for the triennial, including forty porcelain vessels and an acrylic shelf overlaying a video; Campos-Pons appears in front of a mirror performing a sort of ritual to the rhythm of music composed by Neil Leonard, while wearing a Yoruba mask which she later removes to paint her face white and cover her head with a veil, like a porcelain doll, suggesting a resemblance between the figures yet revealing a multifaceted and different appearance. The vessels evoke the relationship between Chinese porcelain used in Santería rituals (an Afro-Cuban religion combining Yoruba and Catholic elements), echoing the syncretism and presence of those cultures in herself and in Cuba. For the second and next iterations of the installation, the artist made and hand-painted each vase during her residency at the Harvard Ceramics Program in 2008, depicting landscapes of Cuba, Chinese characters and symbols, as well as Yoruba deities like Ochún, Ogún, Changó, and Yemayá, among others.In addition, Campos-Pons created a self-portrait that often accompanies the installation, titled “My Mother Told Me I Am Chinese: The Painting Lesson” (2008). In her characteristic grid-like composition, the portrait features nine or, in some cases, twenty-one, large-scale polaroids that capture her dressed as in the video from “China Porcelain” with her face painted in white. What began as the construction of an exploratory character in the past, later came to be her artistic “persona”: FeFa (standing for Familiares en el Extranjero/Family Abroad). FeFa appeared both in photos and in person in performances around the globe, as in the 11th Havana Biennial in 2012 and the 55th Venice Biennial in 2013, among many others until the present day. In 2024, she produced a new watercolor piece recreating her figure from the polaroids, to be presented at Galerie Barbara Thumm for the first time.Despite not being initiated into the Santería religion, Campos-Pons grew up among its practices and often incorporates some of its elements into her pieces, re-imagining how traditions were kept and transmitted across generations in her family. In fact, similarly to her 2008 “China porcelain” installation, in 2021-2023 she created the series “Liminal Circularity, Family Whisper,” consisting of six portraits representing Yoruba-Santería deities but now in the form of some of her women relatives. The additional portraits were shown at the 2023 Sharjah Biennial and most recently at the 2024 Diriyah Biennial, and two new triptychs will be on view for the first time at Galerie Barbara Thumm. The artworks delve into the artist‘s familial cultural traditions and how they have been passed down across generations, hence the “circularity” in the title. In “(Portrait #4) Cousin María, Feast for Ogún,” a woman honors Ogún, deity of iron and war, holding a platter of fruits commonly used in ritual practices (mamey, banana, and watermelon) while seating on an iron stool and resting her feet over a machete, Ogún’s symbol. The pink flowers in the background also allude to the orisha, they are “Yerba Diez del Día,” used as offerings in rituals. “Portrait #5” portrays a scene associated with Yemayá, deity of the sea and maternity, depicting a woman in a blue dress standing on coral-patterned spheres and symbolic blue flowers also used as offerings, like blue jasmine, hydrangeas, blue plumbago, and larkspurs. In front of each portrait stands a small glass stool, a replica of a family heirloom that Campos-Pons’ includes as a symbol of tradition and shared heritage between the women in her family.The gallery’s project space presents a series of videos by the artist in collaboration with Kamaal Malak, some of which were showcased during the performance “A Mother‘s River of Tears” in her solo exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum in New York in 2023. For this occasion, Campos-Pons performed a ritual in commemoration of violence and injustices against black people, accompanied by other women and live music by Kamaal Malak. Campos-Pons described this performance and its elements as “a call to radical love in unity, radical love in the present, radical love in healing, radical love in dreaming together of a better future, a cleansing of space, a cleansing of history.” (1)The exhibiton offers a glimpse into some of the works of this multifaceted artist, a selection of pieces made years apart that continue to respond to Campos-Pons’ ever-lasting and ever-changing quest to explore her identity. Her works lead us to question absolute truths about who we are and how we define ourselves (usually constructed by oral traditions passed down in the family). More importantly, the exhibition extends an invitation to consider identity as a process that is built every day, a matter of the present rather than a static one anchored in the past.María Magdalena Campos-Pons‘ works have been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston), the Whitney Museum, the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, among others. She has also presented her pieces at events and venues around the world such as the Guangzhou Triennial, Dak‘Art, the Venice Biennial, the Havana Biennial, the Sharjah Biennial, the Johannesburg Biennial, and most recently at the Diriyah Biennial. She founded the projects Intermittent Rivers in Matanzas, Cuba, Engine for Art Democracy and Justice at Vanderbilt with Vanderbilt and Frist University, and When We Gather.

Their strong graphical appearance and monochromatic colour pallet are informed by the artist’s experience as a self-proclaimed nomad. Here, the artist’s ability to bring storytelling into a modernist context is motivated by her travels and encounters. Indeed, the ebb and flow of her life is reflected in the often highly textured and layered works.Florian Baudrexel’s ongoing cardbirds series offers a similar approach. Embracing the formal language of modernism, the artist constructs sculptural forms from individual elements made from discarded cardboard packaging. The self-coloured works employ a strong geometric vocabulary, subverted by printed text or marks and wear from their former use. The play between found materials and the notion of ready-made and architectural forms unite to create engaging sculptures that suggest movement.Similarly, Beat Zoderer’s paintings are also constructed in a layered approach that articulates linear, wedge-like bars of colour that traverse over the picture plane; as one angular shape ends, the next reverses, either in a closely stacked zig-zag that pushes to the edge of the work or evolves at different angles, influenced solely by the artist’s inherent understanding of composition. Zoderer’s distinct colour pallet is loosely applied, resulting in opaque layers of colour. The works suggest a space that reflects an idiosyncratic painting approach, reflecting the artist’s interest in sculptural form.","Malene Birger, Florian Baudrexel and Beat Zoderer - A joint exhibition with Wellwood Gallery","7 Ledbury Mews North, Notting Hill, W11 2AF",By Appointment, 25 May  - 2 Jun 2024

He is the precise observer who debunked the illusion of individuality and made us aware of the uniformity of our images of life.Warhol’s late works also evoke an artistic language of the »myths of everyday life« (Roland Barthes), template-like images of the consciousness industry and the power of commodity consumption from everyday American culture: identity-forming images from a time in which the era of digital and social media became a reflection between art and life. For Warhol, everything became the surface of an apparent utopia in which sender and receiver exchange analogue messages. In his cool agnosticism of appearances, he processed the messages from a neurotic flood of images.Based on reproductions, newspaper articles and adverts, Warhol transforms the pictorial objects he appropriates by enlarging, hatching and fragmenting them in his drawings. The painterly gesture of the forms and the use of ink and acrylic paint on paper to create strong black and white contrasts take Warhol to the boundaries between painting and drawing. Many years after creating early works in a ›blotted line‹ technique and the accentuated outline drawings of his artistic beginnings, he found a new freedom of expression beyond screen printing.»Andy Warhol.

The young artist is interested in the balance of life; core philosophical ideas about how one is only capable of experiencing goodness in contrast with badness; dark with light; heaven versus hell, et cetera.The sentiment is one considered by a legion of great thinkers, including Nietzsche, who's existentialist views on life and creativity address the greatest of philosophical paradoxes. ""How can those who live in the light of the day possibly comprehend the depths of the night?” Nietzsche famously wrote in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. The book features a prophet relaying humankind's desire to create something superior to the limits of one's physicality.The desire to break free from constraints seems appropriate when speaking of Kabangu. It recalls the artist-as-tortured-genius, where the process of creation is one of struggles and rewards. ""Some of the hardest things in life are also the most rewarding,"" he states. “My mission is to find a balance between the ugly and the beautiful, the light and the dark. To create an energy that speaks to me. When I have captured this energy, the work is finished.”Kabangu's work does seem to tap into a prophetic feeling of immediacy and, perhaps, feelings of rage and joy. ""Smiling Through The Pain"" suggests this polarity.Here, Kabangu has created a sort of repeated narrative through his choice of imagery and motifs: hovering, disembodied, face-like forms – demarcated with broad and frenetic mark-making and bright colours – which seem based as much in the African tribal masks of his youth (Kabangu moved to Copenhagen at the age of nine), as they appear to subvert the derogatory ‘Jim Crow’ caricature of the 19th Century, or the latter era Golliwog stereotypes that were perpetuated in popular visual media into the 20th Century.And for Kabangu to appropriate such imagery and thereafter imbue it with his own identity suggests a powerful reclamation of a previously problematic and pejorative territory. But in this process the young artist creates a new sort of codex or semiological series of signs and symbols. There is, undoubtedly, a spirituality lurking behind these bold colours, wild brushstrokes, and whatever chemical reactions occur on Kabaungu's surface. The introduction of sand to these surfaces further suggests a darkness underneath - or, perhaps a desire to directly challenge viewers; they appear to ask us to reach into them to question their philosophical intent. Kabangu approaches these cryptograms and figures with an urgency that is at times lyrical, musical, fluid, or even aggressive.There is something enigmatic – despite their immediacy – in what Kabangu chooses to reveal or conceal. And from this technique is a brazenly confident repositioning of Kabangu’s (now trademark) reductive form – these nondescript orange eyes, these purple lips – as he owns the responsibility to remove these referents from a prejudicial and pejorative visual history into a newly empowered arena, where a young black man can create new modes of representation with a wry and empathetic sensibility, as well as the deft skill and confidence of a young master.We are thrilled to bring this powerful new body of work to our collectors and followers.",Jack Kabangu: Smiler Gennem Smerten (Smiling Through The Pain),"51 Little Britain, EC1A 7BH","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 18 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

While in the marriage, she felt there could only be one sculptor, and so it was not until 1952 that she gained the success, freedom, and confidence to dare to experiment in new media and her focus shifted entirely to sculpture. This exhibition will feature several early sculptures from the 1950s and 1960s, mostly created with the lost-wax process.An entire gallery will be devoted to her rarely known series of assemblages from the 1970s called I Ching.

Untitled (I Ching) is totemic in feel, made from thin wood pieces placed together in rhythmic patterns. Towards the end of her career, Dehner started working with fabricators to fulfill her dream of making large-scale sculpture. The centerpiece to the exhibition is one the largest she ever created called Prelude and Fugue from 1989, standing over eight feet tall and eight feet wide made from painted black steel. Demeter’s Harrow (1990) is a large-scale playful sculpture created by connecting geometric forms made from Corten Steel.Joan Marter, Ph.D., President of the Dorothy Dehner Foundation, through her research and writing has placed Dehner in the context of other Abstract Expressionists resulting in many recent accolades. In 2023, Dehner was the feature article in the Woman’s Art Journal, “Dorothy Dehner and the Women Sculptors Among the Abstract Expressionists,” which discusses Dehner’s close friendship with Louise Nevelson. Dehner has been included in numerous group exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, most recently in Making Space: Women Artists and Postwar Abstraction (2017). Dehner’s totemic sculpture Encounter is currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.Dehner is situated in the canon of Abstract Expressionist sculptors alongside Nevelson, Louise Bourgeois, Herbert Ferber, Ibram Lassaw, David Hare, and David Smith. Her work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Museum of Women in the Arts, Storm King Art Center, The British Museum, and Dresden Museum, among many others.

While inspired by these historic references, McCaw confronts the question of what a photograph is and what its elements – time, light, lenses, photo-sensitive paper – can be.Experimenting with large-format cameras and with various printing processes, Chris McCaw began building his own cameras in 1995. The artist equips his large-format cameras with powerful lenses typically used for military surveillance. Instead of film, McCaw inserts expired fiber-based gelatin silver photo paper directly into the camera. Pointing the lens at the sun, McCaw makes recordings ranging from thirty seconds to as long as 84 hours. The sun, intensified by the lens, scorches its path across the paper while creating a solarized image of the landscape or seascape below – a “direct positive” image made in-camera, without an intervening negative. Seeking to extend the duration of his photographs, McCaw has made four trips to the Arctic Circle in summer when the sun never sets to document the “midnight sun.” Throughout his work, these burned lines and holes are tangible traces of the act of making each photograph: marking time, recording location, mapping weather conditions and channeling light. The minimalist skylines or horizons, where visible, evoke for their part the transitory nature of the elements in the locales where McCaw chooses to photograph: the desert, the sea, or the mountains.Describing his work as being more of a collaboration between artist and subject, McCaw explains, ""… not only is the resulting image a representation of the subject photographed, but the subject, the sun, is an active participant in the printmaking… both creating and destroying the resulting photograph.""Born in 1971, McCaw’s work has been exhibited at institutions including the National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C.), the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston and the Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), the J. Paul Getty Museum (Los Angeles), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York), the Chrysler Art Museum, (Norfolk), the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C), the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington D.C), the Victoria & Albert Museum (London, UK), among many others. McCaw is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Andy Warhol Foundation's New Works Grant and Alternative Exposure Grant, as well as the Emerging Icon in Photography award from the George Eastman House. The artist lives and works in Pacifica, California.The exhibition is complemented by a book entitled ""Marking Time"", published by Datz Press.

Tillmans’s new exhibition at Galerie Buchholz attests to his ongoing interest in this significant aspect of his practice: the recording of materiality and sculptural forms in his work.While rooted in the material world, Tillmans’s works are the result of an interplay of optical translations of matter, which the artist transforms through the technological use of the camera. Under his gaze, purposeful objects cease to have their specific functionality and are morphed into sculptural objects of meditation, pointing beyond their intended purpose: a steel urinal radiates sensations of texture and reflection; a large, seemingly stranded, freight container, exhibited at a 1:1 scale, invites us to look at its sheer presence and mediate on its size, color, and shape; a gigantic advertising structure acts as pure material distortion; and a tower of brussel sprouts becomes an active element in an examination of play and scale in the making of a picture.Tillmans often makes his pictures in moments of heightened awareness, moments in which he encounters a shift in his surroundings, or in moments when shifts in his surroundings activate his gaze. He finds his subjects as much as his subjects find him, a fact that is made apparent in the relatability of his pictures.In a view from the artist’s Berlin studio on a rainy day, Tillmans captures rain as it falls, freezing the raindrops with the use of new camera technology, allowing each drizzling drop to appear like a glass sphere in which the world around is mirrored as seen through a lens, upside down.Tillmans’s specific pictorial strategy is also an inquiry into the workings of our cognitive apparatus that transforms visual experiences into cognitive ones. He looks at very ordinary things, often staging them, to try to make them reachable, to make them understandable. In his still lifes nothing is purposeful, and yet they convey a sense of the constructedness of the picture that finds its echo in the constructedness of the world, which we often deem as given.Traversing the two main galleries is a sculptural display structure made of four different building-site planks, which take the artist’s interest in horizontal displays to a new distinct direction. These displays expose the exhibits laid unprotected on top, emphasizing the purity of their material presence. The leporello offset-prints and laser-prints Tillmans made for this installation are present as much as sculptural paper objects as carriers of imagery and media of information.Punctuating the exhibition are Tillmans’s Lighter works, which negotiate fundamental aspects of photographic image-making as they address the distribution of light and the distribution of space onto a given surface of paper. These folded chromogenic prints, which depict their own three-dimensional shape through shades and gradations of color, are the result of their own three-dimensional materiality exposed to light in the darkroom. Tillmans’s Lighter works always act like borders between two distinct areas of experience, of light meeting space, thereby creating color and depth through purely material means.Coinciding with the exhibition is the release of Tillmans’s second album Build from Here. Driven by a desire to explore and to expose, the album navigates joy and heartbreak amid ruin and rebuilding, embodying defiance in uncertain futures, and extending Tillmans’s multifaceted and open approach to making as a gesture towards hope. Co-produced by Tillmans with Tim Knapp and Bruno Breitzke, the album is released as a 12” vinyl record, a CD, a download, and is available on streaming sites.This exhibition marks the 13th solo show by Tillmans at Galerie Buchholz. 8 years have passed since his 2016 exhibition at the gallery in Berlin which also coincided with Gallery Weekend. In this time the artist has had a major retrospective - To look without fear - which opened at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 2022, and travelled to the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto in 2023, and closed in March 2024 at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. In addition to the North American retrospective, the exhibition Sound is Liquid was shown at the Museum moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien, Vienna in 2021 and included the premiere of his Moon in Earthlight video album. The exhibition Today Is The First Day was presented at WIELS, Brussels in 2020; and his show Rebuilding the Future was on view at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin in 2018-2019. From 2018 to 2022, Tillmans embarked on a major touring exhibition on the African continent titled Fragile which opened at the Musée d’Art Contemporain et Multimédias, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, organized by the Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen, Stuttgart, and traveled throughout Africa, including The GoDown Arts Centre, Nairobi, Kenya, the Johannesburg Art Gallery, South Africa, the Modern Art Museum-Gebre Kristos Desta Center, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the Contemporary Art Gallery, Yaoundé, Cameroon, the Museum for Science and Technology, Accra, Ghana, the Musée des Cultures Contemporaines Adama Toungara, Abobo/Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and the Art Twenty One and Centre for Contemporary Art, Lagos, Nigeria. In 2017, Tate Modern in London presented a large-scale survey of Tillmans’s work. To coincide with the show, Tillmans developed the light and sound installation South Tank transforming the Tate’s subterranean former oil tank, and that same year the Fondation Beyeler in Basel mounted a major solo exhibition, its first devoted to an artist primarily using photography.Born in 1968 in Remscheid, Germany, Wolfgang Tillmans lives and works in Berlin and London. He studied at Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design from 1990-1992. Following his earliest reception in the 1990s - a time in which he worked between London and New York - Wolfgang Tillmans was the first photographer and the first non-British artist awarded the prestigious Turner Prize, presented by Tate Britain in London. Tillmans was a professor at Städelschule in Frankfurt from 2003-2009, and in 2009 was elected to serve as an artist trustee on the board of Tate. In 2012 he was inducted into the Akademie der Künste in Berlin and in 2013 was appointed a member of the Royal Academy of Arts, London. He was the 2015 recipient of the Hasselblad Foundation’s International Award in Photography. In 2018 he was presented with the Kaiserring from the city of Goslar, one of Germany’s most prestigious art prizes. Wolfgang Tillmans was named one of the TIME 100 Most Influential People of 2023.Since 2006, Wolfgang Tillmans has operated the non-profit exhibition space Between Bridges in locations in London and Berlin, opening a new location in 2022 at Adalbertstraße 43 in Berlin. In addition to providing a venue for artists, Between Bridges has since 2017 been a foundation committed to the advancement of democracy, supporting LGBT+ rights and anti-racism work. Political activism has been a core component of Wolfgang Tillmans’s work, with direct involvement in the anti-Brexit campaign in Britain and more recently with responses to the rise in right-wing populism in Germany. At the onset of the Covid pandemic he organised the 2020Solidarity fundraising project connecting over 50 artists’ posters with 100 cultural organisations in 18 countries.",Wolfgang Tillmans,"Fasanenstraße 30, 10719",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 26 Apr  - 15 Jun 2024

In the paintings, seemingly familiar narratives are alluded to but destabilised. The viewer’s own projections are called upon to fulfil the interpretive loop, raising questions about childhood, religion, race, power, and the legacies of empire.These personal stories are told through layers of memory, imagination, and conversations with the history of painting. Drawing on multiple influences including El Greco, Gwen John, Noah Davis, and the Ajanta cave paintings, Krishanu’s work often explores how representations in the canon of Western art have shaped our collective unconscious around questions of race and gender. Working in ongoing series that include Another Country, Mission, and Holy Family, one painting segues into the next as a natural telling of the artist’s own journey through the joys and sorrows of life, with deeply personal subject matter that speaks to the human condition in all its complexity.The exhibition’s title, The Bough Breaks, proceeds from the artist’s recent exhibition On a Limb (Jhaveri Contemporary, Mumbai, 2023). Both exhibitions relate to images from Krishanu’s Two Boys series, in which the artist and his brother are depicted perched on, and to some extent dwarfed by, the majestic branches, or ‘limbs’, of the banyan tree—an iconic symbol in Indian culture. The potential failure of this security—if the bough was to break—alludes to the dark undertones of the nursery rhyme Rock-a-bye Baby, as well as to the evident failure of the structures that should protect, provide for, and perpetuate society: a poignant metaphor for contemporary life.Krishanu’s practice is at once an exploration of subject and medium, where by deeply personal subject matter is a means of approaching his primary, painterly concerns. The compositions provide multiple entry points—at times holding the viewer at bay and, at others, inviting them in. Meaning is implied rather than dictated, barring the path to reductive biographical readings.Just as the paintings offer an immersion in surfaces, this major showcase of primarily new work by the artist will also foreground Krishanu’s drawings and works on paper—what he describes as the generative heartbeat of the exhibition.A new essay by British broadcaster and journalist Bidisha Mamata will be published as the latest edition of Camden Art Centre’s File Note series.",Matthew Krishanu: The Bough Breaks,"Arkwright Road, NW3 6DG","Tue-Sun 11am-6pm, Thur 11am-9pm", 26 Apr  - 23 Jun 2024

Led by an inquisitivenature and discerning eye, he salvages materials then choreographs them in complex structures that sit between figuration and abstraction. Spools that store fibres and threads, and much larger scale equivalents that have an industrial purpose, are a recurring motif in the installation. He masterfully binds, wraps, stitches, sutures, and layers materials with an intuitive, systematic and dynamic approach to colour texture and form, and an innate sense of volume, weight, balance and spatial values.Music is a backdrop for the creation and appreciation of Omoding’s work—often traditional Ugandan folksongs or contemporary African pop music that he plays whilst working in his London studio. The energy and rhythm of the music directly informs the pace of his work, as well as the improvised movements of his fingers and hands. Some objects are scaled to his body to be used performatively, as instruments.In a much-celebrated open studio presentation at Camden Art Centre in 2019, Omoding created a series of makeshift shelters, or tents. Constructed with found fabrics, stitched and suspended like floating patchworks, these textile constructions came from the heart of a family tradition and the love and care of familial bonds. These provisional structures also bore relation to homes created out of necessity, wherever one finds oneself and with whatever protection is at hand—a site of refuge. The trauma of migration, of leaving home and making a new one in a foreign land, is a relevant subject in Omoding’s biography. He immigrated to the UK as a refugee from the Ugandan civil war when he was 12 years old, to re-join his mother who he hadn’t seen since he was nine months old.Omoding’s neurodivergence is reflected in his work in the way in which he processes his experiences, past and present. Amid the complex and at times contradictory nature of everyday life, Omoding looks to material, sound, and movement to communicate, finding embodied expression in the energy and formal qualities of sculpture, welcoming the audience into the experience, and making space for them to conjure their own memories and associations.",Andrew Omoding: Animals to Remember Uganda,"Arkwright Road, NW3 6DG","Tue-Sun 11am-6pm, Thur 11am-9pm", 26 Apr  - 23 Jun 2024

The title, an abstraction of the Portuguese “fora de casa”, as in “jogo fora de casa” – the away game – reveals this series’ origins: while visiting Lisbon Xie came across a notebook, the vibrant green pages of which were each marked with the lines of a football pitch. Perhaps a fun gift for the child whose bedroom walls are adorned with posters of footballers, or possibly a serious tool for the tactician for whom each match is an obsession. The markings of the football pitch – rendered most clearly against a comparable green background in f o r a d e c a s a # 1 – became the basis for this group of paintings, both as a loosely interpreted formal structure for each new work and as a catalyst for their content.Football is a paradox. So trivial yet so serious. It is not a matter of life and death, the great Liverpool manager Bill Shankly reputedly said: it is much more important than that. Or perhaps it is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, said Gary Lineker, the Germans always win. Painting is also a paradox, at least for Xie Nanxing. It is not the truth, he has said, but neither is it just a game. It is “more like a game that is close to the truth, or rather a truth-mimicking game”. He has expressed a “mistrust” of painting, and yet he has spent the last three decades engaged in a deliberate and meticulous studio painting practice.Nowhere is Xie’s ambivalent, conflictual attitude towards painting more apparent than in the “canvas print” technique which he has often returned to over the last fifteen years and which he uses in several of these paintings. f o r a d e c a s a # 8, for example, is ostensibly the most abstract of the paintings in the exhibition – we see a central green circle, perhaps a centre circle, overlaid with faintly stippled polychromatic marks. As we continue to look, traces of figures begin to emerge to the left of the canvas, while to the right we see a harder-edged form and a rich patch of green reminiscent of the first painting in this series. These marks are in fact the literal traces of another painting which was made on an unstretched canvas that had been laid over the top of the surface we now see, such that some of the paint seeped through. That painting was then removed, never to be shown, and we are left with its “shadows” – evidence of painting having taken place.And yet in this same series Xie Nanxing also embraces sheer painterly bravura, albeit interrupted by football scorecards, while in overtly citing Goya’s The Sleep Of Reason Produces Monsters (and not for the first time) Xie embraces his work’s place in a longer tradition of painting. Some paintings suggest abstraction, but others are uncharacteristically direct in their figuration. A football match can be tense and tactical, but it can also be an explosion of excitement. Catenaccio or heavy metal football. “Xie Nanxing’s paintings cannot be cast in the camps of either aestheticized objecthood or conceptual dematerialization”, the curator and art historian Ruth Noack has acutely observed, “they hover firmly in between”.",Xie Nanxing: f o r a d e c a s a,"Karl-Marx-Allee 45, D-10178",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 25 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

Representing the profound ideology of infinity, energy flows along their uninterrupted contours. The exhibition is spanned over the two floors of the gallery and its designed to offer visitors a glimpse into Carlesso’s artistic production. The ground floor of Cardi Gallery is reserved for four majestic sculptures that show the artist’s eclecticism in working with different materials.As a sculptor’s material, marble has always fascinated the artist. The remarkable thing about marble is that by absorbing light it turns translucent if not transparent. In the same way it absorbs darkness and shade, with its milky white blending from any shades of grey to transparent black.The homogeneity of shape, together with various surface, gives proof of the artist’s craftmanship, of his sensitivity towards the essential qualities of the material.Carlesso’s objects are deconstructions of stone, metal or wood. Wriggling over pedestals or the bare floor, they allow the spectator to look through, openings at squares, triangles or rectangles. They seem to intertwine endlessly; there is neither end nor beginning - apparently. The spectator is offered an opportunity of becoming lost in infinity. The eye travels across polished surfaces to be arrested by rough, natural cuts or deliberately applied hatches.Three-dimensional bodies come to life under the sculptor’s skilled hands - free-standing, vulnerable, extremely light yet spaciously resting in themselves. Once more corporeality appears an intangible illusion - calculated uncertaintyGianpietro Carlesso was born in Bolzano, Italy in 1961, and lives and works in Cormons, Italy. He was educated at the Trento State Art Institute and at the Academy of Fine Arts in Urbino.Carlesso carves intricate, organically shaped, abstract compositions out of a single piece of marble, by hand. Tactile, and large, yet delicate and impactful, these impressive sculptures demonstrate the importance of material and process, showing the artist’s true mastery and skill. In recent years, he has connected with scientists and conducted a number of studies on the concept of infinity and attempted to visualize it through his most celebrated series of Curvatura. In 2008, he represented the City of Milan in the Venice Biennial of Architecture with the monumental work Equilibrio Dinamico Della Città in Divenire.Carlesso’s works are in important international public collections including the Wilhelm Lehmbruck Museum, Duisburg, Germany; The Mannheim Kunsthalle, Mannheim, Germany; The Deutsche Bank Art Collection, Frankfurt, Germany; The Deutsche Post, Dortmund, Germany; The Museum of Modern Art in Bolzano, Italy; the City of Milan; and the City of Bolzano, Italy, as well as in various important private collections in Italy and around the world.",Gianpietro Carlesso: Prototipi e Sculture,"Corso Di Porta Nuova 38, 20121","Mon-Fri 9.30am-6.30pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 10 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

The paintings on show demonstrate the artist’s tireless conviction in the poetics of abstraction, as well as the gradual adoption of a looser, more essential visual language influenced by Japanese calligraphy.Through vivid gestural marks and a masterful use of colour, Schneider’s mature works record the artist’s fleeting, exalted movements in space. Using wide brushes, Schneider applied paint across the canvas in rapid, dynamic motions that, once imprinted on the surface, came together to form an “orchestral whole”. The resulting paintings are musical in essence, each visual element producing a corresponding rhythm or melodic effect that envelops the viewer. Influenced by Kandinsky’s seminal theories of abstraction earlier in the century, Schneider often employed musical analogies to describe his creative process. “The spectator is free to interpret according to his feelings”, he once remarked of his paintings, “in the same way he might react to a sonata.” In 1945 he began titling most of his works “Opus”, reinforcing their inherent lyrical quality.Born in Sainte-Croix in Switzerland, Schneider enrolled at the École Nationale des beaux-arts de Paris in 1918 before settling permanently in the French capital in 1922. In the following years, he devoted himself to the study of art history while writing poetry and frequenting the city’s avant-garde circles. In the 1930s Schneider came into contact with Surrealism, and was drawn to that group’s fascination with the unconscious and practice of automatic drawing. While participating in several group exhibitions in Paris, including the Salon des Surindépendants and the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles, he gradually moved away from representation in favour of abstract forms and intuitive, imaginary compositions. By the early 1940s, his paintings had abandoned any trace of figurative representation.As his work gained prominence in post-war Paris, Schneider established himself as a major figure within the growing Lyrical Abstraction movement, with solo exhibitions in New York and across Europe throughout the early 1950s. The paintings of this period are characterised by a rich, dark colour palette and expressionistic brushwork that imparts a physical and emotional intensity.By the 1960s, Schneider’s marks became sharper and more calligraphic in nature, with brightly coloured backgrounds counterpointed by linear, black strokes that suggest the weight and orientation of the brush itself. The 1970s, which critic Michel Ragon described as the “luminous years” of the artist’s career, saw the artist increasingly adopting acrylic paint and working directly on paper, enabling a fluid, uninterrupted mark as well as a faster working method. These late works are a culmination of Schneider’s ultimate commitment to painting, alternating between dramatic tension and harmonious balance with a remarkable economy of means. Since the early 1950s, Gérard Schneider has been the subject of many retrospectives in Europe and abroad. He participated in the first two editions of Documenta in Kassel (1955, 1959), and exhibited three times at the Venice Biennale (1948, 1954 and 1966). For the 1966 edition, an entire room of the French Pavilion was devoted to his work. In 1957, Schneider won the Lissone Grand Prize for Abstract Art. His works also travelled regularly to Japan from 1950 until the early 1970s, especially for the International Exposition of Art.In addition, for the International Art Exhibition in Tokyo in 1959, he was awarded the prize of the Governor of Tokyo. Schneider also showed several times at the São Paulo Biennale (1951, 1953 and 1961). His works are held in the permanent collections of institutions worldwide, including the Musee d’Art Moderne, Brussels; the Walker Center of Minneapolis, Minnesota; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Phillips Collection, Washington D.C.; the Musée national d’Art Moderne – Centre Pompidou, Paris; and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Quebec, among many others.",Gérard Schneider,"22 Grafton Street, W1S 4EX","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 3 May  - 20 Jul 2024

Each serve as a powerful talisman, embodying the unique traits and character of its associated animal. As a continuation of their first collaboration, HunRod – known for its bold and exaggerated wearable designs – Lamy and Rodkin challenge stereotypes by creating what they coin as “finger armour”, redefining the conventional perception of delicate feminine jewellery.The Snake Ring, adorned with a single pear-shaped diamond, embodies the wit and humour associated with this intellectually driven creature. Energy and vibrancy radiates from the Monkey Ring, embellished with 61 white diamonds, reflecting the exuberance of those born in the Year of the Monkey. Finally, the Rabbit Ring, adorned with 105 white diamonds and one brown diamond, symbolises intelligence, responsibility and loyalty.The jewellery is complemented by the Rick Owens’ design pieces, an expression of his signature style of glamour with a provocative edge. The Plug Table Black Plywood (2011) channels Owens’ minimal aesthetic with its geometric shapes, clean lines and monochrome palette. Hustool Gold (2022), formulated from bronze patinated in polished gold, pays homage to Michèle Lamy with the title affectionately referring to her nickname ‘Hun.’ Other works on display include Large Plate (2016), constructed from bronze with an elegant and simplistic form; Bowl, which features a round shape, small triangle detail and polished surface; and the Candle Pillar (2007), a brutalist column that would make the ideal accompaniment to the dining table experience.Since launching their first collection in 2015 from Rodkin’s atelier in LA, the pair have yielded beguiling creations under the alias HunRod – a portmanteau of their names, Lamy, known as ‘Hun’, and Rodkin.

Each designer articulates the vision of their commissioners, whether public or private, emanating their mastery from inception to completion.Originally crafted for Palais des Ministères, Chandigarh, Bureau des Ministres by Le Corbusier is an exceptionally rare piece of design history. The desk features a two-part removable top and an open corner supported by three legs. The smooth wood and angular design of the desk compliments the geometric shape of Serge Mouille’s Large Lamp Wall Lamp with 6 Rotating Arms – a unique wall lamp that was made by Serge Mouille for his studio in 1963 when he moved to Monthiers, France. The work is not just impressive for its scale, but it also features the artist’s signature kinetic sculptural aesthetic with its six rotatable arms, sensually curved shades and bent metal arms that balance fragility and size in harmonious union.MONUMENTAL also showcases a selection of previously unseen masterpieces, including Joaquim Tenreiro’s Credenza, Charlotte Perriand’s Conference Table, Sergio Rodrigues’ Bookcase and Michel Boyer’s Brasilia Chandelier.Joaquim Tenreiro’s Credenza (1959-65), a large-scale sideboard created from Pau Marfim, reveals Tenreiro’s mastery working in native woods through its exceptional diamond motif. Credenza showcases Tenreiro’s fusion of artistic aesthetics and practical design while also highlighting the artist’s mastery of craft within a modern and minimal aesthetic.Stretching to more than eight meters, Charlotte Perriand’s Conference Table (1947) is one of the artist’s most imposing works and a prime example of her design output during this period, which was defined by prestigious public commissions. Conference Table was created for the France-United States Memorial Hospital in Normandy, France and was later used as a model created for the Palais des Nations, the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The ingenuity of the design is exemplified by the perfectly proportioned aerodynamic lines.Brazilian designer Sergio Rodrigues’ Bookcase (1960s), which draws inspiration from indigenous cultures in Brazil, anchors his style towards more organic materials to show the possibilities of what can be achieved through wood. Michel Boyer’s Brasilia Chandelier (1974), conceived in the 1970s for the French Embassy in Brasilia, is iconic in design and features exceptional dimensions. Depicting a suspended boxy frame and lacquered white crisscross pattern, the chandelier was designed with four cylinders that play with the traditional notion of lighting structures.The exhibition extends outdoors into Ladbroke Hall’s garden, where visitors can experience Maison Démontable (1944) by Jean Prouvé. Originally designed in the 1940s as a response to post-war housing needs, the design was concentrated on rapid assembly, functionality and easily accessible materials. The Maison Démontable house showcases Prouvé’s pioneering approach to prefabrication and modular design. Following the exhibition, the work will be installed permanently as an outdoor Pavilion at Ladbroke Hall, a focal point of the new garden designed by acclaimed landscape gardener Luciano Giubbilei, opening to the public in mid-May in tandem with the exhibition.",Monumental: Tipping the Scales of Historical Design,"79 Barlby Road, W10 6AZ","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 16 May  - 22 Sep 2024

The artwork is similar to Shonibare’s Wind Sculptures series which reimagines that traditional notion of sculpture by utilising materials such as fibreglass and bronze to depict billowing fabric caught in the wind.Windy Chair takes on the paradoxical task of manifesting the invisible. We cannot see the wind around us, but its effects are evident throughout nature and the modern world. Shonibare skilfully creates the illusion of the dynamic movement of a piece of fabric caught in a gust of wind despite the artwork being crafted from weighty aluminium and steel. By evoking this illusion, the sculptures symbolise the fluidity and adaptability of human experience in an increasingly interconnected world. The surface of the work is populated with colourful and playful patterns, inspired by Dutch-wax fabric. The artwork reflects an innovative approach to contemporary design and fabrication, achieving remarkable energy and balance in a gravity-defying form.Shonibare uses Western art history and literature to explore contemporary culture and national identities. His work explores issues of race and class through the media of painting, sculpture, photography, and film.

Designers used this construction boom as an opportunity to experiment with new materials like metal and concrete, as well as to explore industrialised modes of production. These innovations were applied with the goal of improving the lives of the people interacting with them and the 6×6 house exemplifies Prouvé’s participation within this humanist design movement.The earlier models of Prouvé’s “demountable buildings,” including Maison Démountable, exemplify the initial stages of Prouvé’s soon-to-be revolutionary innovation in prefabricated housing. The structure is simple, Prouvé and his studio reduced the house to its most essential qualities and included his trademark “portal frame system”. The house is based on a 1-meter maquette and the design is a modular system, with a floor, wall panels with built-in door and windows, partitioning elements, and a roof. The structure was designed to be divided into three rooms, exhibiting Prouvé’s genius for efficiency.A restoration team worked on the house with a high level of care and attention to detail. All the renovations done were in keeping with the spirit of the original design. A two by six metre porch was installed, as well as doors to access it. New, airtight windows were installed to increase the isolation of the structure. The painting was restored to its original condition and underfloor heating was added to the restored original parquet floors.

As with much of Trevelyan’s recent work, Fuse stems from a desire to broaden the scope of his practice by setting aside a brief-led design approach to draw inspiration from structured experimentation in both material and process such that uncertainty and unfamiliarity become integral to the creation of the work. Derived initially from a thought experiment involving the fusion of simple forms to create structure, the evolution of this series was informed by both wooden puzzles from childhood and the construction of simple maquettes in which pins were used to temporarily assemble larger structures. Translating the concept from maquette to large sculptural pieces in marble and bog oak required a meticulous design process involving precise sculpting of curved geometries to enable the forms to slot together and lock. As such, the aesthetic simplicity belies a technical complexity and the series exemplifies a blend of sculptural elegance with structural precision.The exhibition continues on the first level of the gallery with works from the Gyre series that meld digital fabrication with meticulous hand-sculpting and finishing. Trevelyan has previously worked largely in bronze – in contrast Gyre features works that are characterised by a spontaneous painterly approach to the expression of both form and colour in the finished works. Elegantly looped structures of 3D printed sand and resin undergo a process in which thickened pigmented epoxy is built up in multiple layers over many days to build a surface patina in which colour and texture are interlinked. Cutting back the final surface reveals a stratigraphy of hues from palettes unique to each work that are drawn from personal experience. The accompanying maquettes are selected from various stages of the process, illustrating the exploration of form, texture and colour that informs the development of the works.Despite their apparent differences in aesthetic and material, Gyre and Fuse share an underlying commonality in that both are assemblages of uniform morphologies. While Fuse merges simple pebble-like forms and Gyre consists of concentric hollow structures, both series explore the creation of structures in a manner that exhibits a coherence in their base sculptural language.",Charles Trevelyan: Vignettes,"79 Barlby Road, W10 6AZ","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 16 May  - 13 Jul 2024

The pieces invite viewers to engage with themes of migration and cultural hybridity, emerging as an artistic odyssey into the aesthetics of contemporary urban life. The dynamic interplay of diverse cultures within these spaces are seen through anatomies that could be plucked from the Los Angeles environment or from the depths of an artist’s laboratory.Although differing significantly from his recent collections Archaeology of Consciousness and Éternel, Crossing Over continues the artist’s signature expression of recycled surfaces. The recovery of materials is a fundamental part of the development of Crossing Over and becomes its primary creative act. Hand-painted recycled fibreglass, semi-precious stones and metals combine in a new assembly of processes and contribute to a new organicity, as seen in De Cotiis’s distinct and monumental cabinets. The DC2117 Cabinet (2012), for example, is constructed of hand-painted fiberglass and German silver, the black façade presented as a shard of ancient material on a modern scale. These pieces are geometric and avant-garde, poetically brutalist and functionally simple – a meeting point that embraces the clash between urbanisation and the natural world.In other works, De Cotiis’ Neo-Primitive low tables are rooted to the ground like sturdy thrones; notable works include the DC2203B Side Table (2020), made from Malachite Challant marble, with opposing textures of hand-painted fiberglass, and the DC2211 Side Table (2022), which features contrasting materials and patterns cascading like the depths of the ocean. The DC1924 Floor Lamp (2019) consists of angular neon lights encapsulated in antiquated glass tubes and set in a polished and cast brass frame, a material that’s come a signature of the artist. Each piece demonstrates De Cotiis’ introspection into linguistics, perception and materiality.Crossing Over resembles the work of an anthropologist who, through the study of cultures and traces, combines the differences and similarities within a given period.  De Cotiis thinks of pure time as perpetual, absent from our world that’s saturated with images, simulacra, and reconstructed realities. Crossing Over becomes a nuanced tapestry, weaving together the intricate threads of temporal diversity and the timeless purity of existence.De Cotiis comments: “Crossing Over is a journey, an exploration in search of places that I have seen and spaces that exist in my imagination. I have pursued cultures in search of symbols and iconographies that overlap with mine. It is research on contamination. All that is layered inside me, which belongs to me, but above all, what I still haven’t yet encountered.”",Vincenzo De Cotiis: Crossing Over,"7070 Santa Monica Boulevard, CA 90038","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 28 Feb  - 19 Jun 2024

A window or passage on the verge of opening, you enter and become fluid. A light flickers, there’s life within and beyond. Sucked in and spat back out into a world, familiar but not. Awoken to a glitching scene made apparent by the light that energises this reality we are now within. The control over your time and movements that you held moments before is no longer in grasp. Transfixed on the screen, time and space become redundant anchors passed this threshold. Boundless, you begin to float over the railings and through the constructed landscape. It’s surreal but familiar, mirroring domains and signposts of visions or places you’ve encountered before. All signifiers of the present have vanished and metamorphosis has begun. You can sense impressions of life are vibrating through the space, due to the confronting forms that seem to respire in an asthmatic way. The steel reflects and refracts almost returning itself back to it’s original fluid state pre manufacturing. Now that we too are scaleless, the fluidity of this cosmos spurs a perpetual motion that carries you through. Images melt into pure movement, morphing into a choreography of synthesis. The enigmatic forms provide speculative spaces that invite introspection as we fight to defend the dissolution of our present and drift further away from the space we occupied before. Details that seemed once important have evaporated under these new conditions, the gap you passed through is closing up. You look around for something familiar to latch onto and catch a hazy mirror projecting back your image, but you too have become a form, a movement, deduced to a spatter of molecules pulsating in the shadows. Elli Antoniou explores the multifaceted notion of ‘the virtual’ and the boundaries of sensory experience. She has devised a hybrid technique combining gestural drawing with the use of abrasive tools to subtly alter the surface of steel panels, transforming their reflective properties. Animated by their surrounding light, her metallic drawings propose scaleless fluid cosmoi in perpetual motion.Misusing power tools to draw, Antoniou’s process is physically demanding. Claiming co-authorship with her tools, she engages with them in a high speed choreography of synthesis. Her subtracting process allows forms to emerge at the surface of the steel sheet, referencing an ontology of fullness; in which the perceptible emerges from the imperceptible. Her drawings propose a world of possibilities with each glistening moment capturing a glitching experience of the present.Antoniou’s research takes the metaphysical as a starting point and weaves these narratives away from identifiable subjects, but rather a dynamic interplay of forces, transformations, tensions and tranquil states. Her narratives take the essence of the Baroque style, proposing an aesthetic of ‘texture’, where matter becomes subject matter; expressing the invisible elements acting upon it.Reflecting on the profound influence of screens within her contemporary perception of space and time, she focuses on their ability to simulate versions of reality beyond the spectrum of human perception through scale, distance or speed. As her sculptures continuously regenerate images under the play of light, they become speculative screens for an unfolding parallel reality, whose profile she is gradually shaping.Elli Antoniou (b.1995, Birmingham, U.K.) grew up in Athens and is currently based in London. She holds an MA in Sculpture from the Royal College of Art and a BA in Fine Art & History of Art from Goldsmiths University of London.

By uncovering these vulnerabilities, the artists invite us to reflect on our imperfections and how they shape our relationships. The visual landscape fluctuates between intimate and isolating moments, charged with atmospheric intensity.Through an alluring dialogue of opposing perspectives, the artists examine profound themes of the human experience, including gender, identity, and the intricate relationship between the body and its environment. Inspired by the duality of the essential self and the physical world, the exhibition provides a profound exploration of the inherent complexities of existence. Drawing upon modernist influences, the work boldly challenges conventional norms and perceptions, offering a fleeting glimpse into a realm intertwined with our deepest psychological vulnerabilities.The featured characters challenge conventional notions of beauty, existing beyond societal norms and free from the constraints of traditional perspectives. While surreal, each artwork encapsulates a utopian ideal that transcends societal expectations. By defying gendered assumptions and societal conventions, the individuals depicted find a sense of freedom, authentically existing within a realm of boundless possibilities. Yet, amidst this liberation, a subtle unease lingers, hinting at the inherent imperfections and complexities that define our shared reality.This powerful exhibition reminds us that perfection is neither achievable nor desirable. By embracing our imperfections, we can forge genuine connections with others and cultivate empathy and mutual understanding. The featured artists challenge us to view vulnerability as a strength and to break down barriers to build more authentic relationships in our personal lives offering a poignant reflection on the complexities of human imperfection and vulnerability.Their work encourages viewers to confront and challenge their personal truths while also celebrating the appeal in embracing one's flaws. Beyond a mere exploration of art, this exhibition is a profound meditation on the human experience in an imperfect world.","MYSELF, WHEN I AM REAL","Lázaro Garza Ayala pte 436, San Pedro Centro Garza García, N.L., 66230",By Appointment, 4 Jun  - 7 Sep 2024

Essentially inspired by his personal experiences and their link with the social environment in which they are lived, Capote is constantly seeking to translate the complex emotional and psychological conflicts of the individual into the physical experience of his work.The name of the exhibition, ESPINARIO, comes from the small statue the “Spinario”, of a boy pulling a thorn from his foot, taken from a legend that inspired many artists from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. This type of statuary dates from the 1st century BC and depicts a young shepherd removing a thorn from his foot. The best-known example of this theme is on display in the Hall of the Triumphs in the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome. The singular, graceful pose of this figure, caught in an unusual gesture, made it one of the most admired and copied works of the Renaissance. With a vitally important message to deliver, the shepherd boy only stopped to pull the thorn from his foot once his mission had been accomplished. While the foot was a symbol of freedom and mobility in ancient traditions, the thorn embodied obstacles, limitations and pain.The use of this myth in Capote’s work follows the characteristic metaphor of the artist as messenger, and shows his own involvement in the transmission of our shared ideas and feelings. In this way, the artist takes on the pain of the world around him, expressing it through his art and relieving people of their pain.Many of the works in the exhibition are new, and are the result of a sensitive examination of contemporary human behaviour, affected by power structures, the fragmentation of the family sphere, conflicting ideologies, fake news and censorship. The artist’s use of precise symbolism is informed by an in-depth analysis of the various inner psychological conflicts we face, individually or collectively, in many parts of the world today.Capote is presenting a new series, Sentimientos Encontrados, based on electrocardiograms collected by the artist from various Cuban individuals, expressing the fragmentation of Cuban society caused by grief and frustration. The use of these techniques manifest the artist’s turn towards abstraction in his artistic language. Made from saw blades, the rhythms of which are based on heartbeats taken from the electrocardiograms of various people in Cuba, the work evokes different ways of feeling and thinking about reality.A similar creative process led to the development of Espinario (síndrome de Procusto), practically echoing the name of the exhibition itself. Based on a work created by the artist in 2003, in which he tried to graphically represent the sound of his voice when he uttered the word “ silence ”, Espinario develops in greater depth his work on the transcription of sound as a creative material. This time, the graphic shapes of the word “ freedom ”, pronounced by many different people, are assembled in a grid pattern to create an aggressive and sharp surface, similar to a bed of thorns. On the other hand, in Lacerante (Paisaje de nostalgia), the artist received the voice files of several Cuban migrants saying words about their experience. Words like: Exile, uprooting, exodus, sadness, farewell, nostalgia, exile, melancholy etc. All these words were cut in bronze with green patina and brown rust corten steel in the size of trees in a maquette. Then all together fixed on an old wooden create a forest.Purification (struggimento) (2024) is a work made specially for the exhibition. Throughout PURIFICATION series Capote recycles and reworks chains, barbed wire fencing, handcuffs, and other metal detritus into alternate shapes and dimensions, there are moments of deconstruction, tension, aggression, and control. All this work process is shown at the gallery in a video that documents the sequences of actions and that contents the most powerful meaning on the work.The new works in the exhibition are presented in dialogue with earlier works by Capote, such as Speechless (2019), Autorretrato (estudio de resistencia) (2019), Obediencia (2019), in which the artist, through the representation of different parts of the human body, dilute the representation of individual experience in a collective empathy, or a social allusion.About the artist:Yoan Capote was born in Pinar del Río, Cuba, in 1977. He graduated from the National School of Art in 1995 and from the Higher Institute of Art in Havana in 2001.He has received distinctions such as the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship (2006), the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Prize (2006) and the Vermont Study Center Fellowship (2002). At the 7th Havana Biennial (2000), he was awarded the UNESCO Prize, together with the DUPP artists’ collective.

Her paintings, approached as landscapes, stem from layers of colors on panels commonly used in construction. She discovered this construction material by watching her father work and developed a desire to experiment with the material while subverting traditional painting on wooden panels. These “panels” are both solid and transformable, giving Barbana Bojadzi the freedom she seeks: she can reuse them by reclaiming construction waste or decide to rework her old works, creating a flow of permanent evolution.Barbana Bojadzi strives to capture an immediate perception of our world without having to interpret gestures, traces, and figures in time. Reflecting the inherent humility and simplicity of her work, her technique is rooted in the search for recurring patterns, which she will use and reinterpret. She draws inspiration from music, whether through simple themes sung repetitively in reform music or focused on experimentation and improvisation. She develops the same relationship with her paintings. The humble and common material used in her works is subjected to slow and repetitive gestures and to external “accidents” that the artist constantly integrates into her practice. Paint drips are incorporated into her compositions, and natural forces like the wind can influence the shape of the panels, sometimes breaking them and forcing the artist to reduce and rework them. Painting mostly outdoors, Barbana Bojadzi is forced to compose her works in the face of contingencies and to push her experimentation further.She views painting as the confrontation of different levels of language, leading her to use multiple layers of colors and materials, painting and “sculpting” the surface to reveal its stratifications. These landscapes are thus built and rebuilt over time, through additions or removals of material, to reveal their wounds, traces, and changes. To see Barbana Bojadzi’s works, one must be able to pause: to contemplate them, taking the time to observe every detail and corner, discerning a new detail, a new complexity.The edge of the work often reveals the color of the original material, allowing those who know it to identify it. By working on several works at once and almost constantly using already used panels, the artist gives free rein to her freedom. The works can thus be assembled like pieces of a puzzle or divided into several pieces, infinitely nourishing the artist’s creative process. Seeking to liberate and free her gesture, she goes as far as to create her own tools and instruments of work, to be constrained neither by the material nor by the elements with which she will transform it. Her artistic practice is therefore primarily a formal search for freedom.About the artist:Born in 1996, Barbana Bojadzi is an artist originally from Kosovo who currently lives and works in Provins, France. She graduated from the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 2021, with honors from the jury. At the Beaux-Arts, she was mentored by Dominique Gauthier, Nina Childress, and Dominique Figarella.In her artistic practice, Barbana Bojadzi is particularly interested in the memory associated to gesture, the idea of imprint, and its relation to Time. Her artworks are characterized by the accumulation of layers, colors, and textures, thus creating a stratification of meanings and materials, where the image emerges by a mechanism of extraction. Barbana Bojadzi is always seeking new technical processes, highlighting used and reclaimed materials that reflect the humility and simplicity we find in her work.Barbana Bojadzi recently won the Khalil de Chazournes Prize, awarded by the Amis des Beaux-Arts de Paris, as well as the 2023 Sisley Prize for young creation, and one of her works is now part of the Société Générale Art Collection. She was also part of many group shows, including “Société Générale Art Collection” at the Société Générale Tower, Puteaux (France), “Felicità” at POUSH, Aubervilliers (France).",Barbana Bojadzi: Ordered Fields,"87 rue du Temple, 75003",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 2 Apr  - 28 May 2024

Throughout his career, he has experimented with and developed a large number of proposals that have remained emblematic of his artistic language. In tune with the profound societal changes taking place around him, he dedicated himself to inventing a new body of work, exploring unconventional techniques and technologies that would play a decisive role in his approach.Carlos Cruz-Diez was thirty-seven years old when, in 1960, he decided to leave Caracas and move to Paris with his family. After studying at the Académie des Beaux-Arts and a long spell as an illustrator, he chose the cultural vibrancy of Paris to pursue his investigation of perceptual-sensory dynamics.“The Euphoria of Colour” (“L’euphorie de la couleur”) presents the highlights of Carlos Cruz-Diez’s artistic career, exploring his theory of colour through some of his most emblematic works.The landmark works Fisicromía 54 and Fisicromía 55 (1962) and Objeto rítmico móvil manipulable (1956) represent the beginnings of the artist’s research into the dissociation of the binomial of form and colour and the fragmentation of the plane, research that the artist approached in order to transcend the notions of the purpose of art.This exhibition presents five of the eight proposals developed by the artist, based on three colour conditions (subtractive, additive and reflective), each of them responding to different colour behaviours.The Couleur Additive (1959) is based on the radiation of colours. When one colour plane touches another, a coloured line appears at the point of contact. And yet this virtual colour is not in the medium. By isolating this optical phenomenon, Cruz-Diez obtains what are known as “chromatic event modules”, responsible for the continuous transformation of colour.The Physichromie (1959) are structures designed to reveal certain circumstances and conditions related to colour, changing according to the movement of the viewer and the intensity of the light, and thus projecting colour into space to create an evolutionary situation of additive, reflective, and subtractive colour. The movement of the viewer or the light source creates a series of chromatic variations.The Inductions Chromatiques (1963) are closely related to the phenomenon of after-image, or retinal persistence. In other words, the retina of the eye, after gazing at a coloured plane for a certain length of time, retains, even after the observer has looked away, an image of the plane – but now in the induced colour or complementary colour. Inductions Chromatiques make visible a phenomenon that can only be captured momentarily and in very specific circumstances. The colour that appears is and is not – it has a virtual existence – but is just as real as the pigments used.Induction Chromatique à double fréquence (2018) on the long wall of the corridor is one of the monumental works whose format relates to the architecture of the space. The viewer’s movements around the work, as well as the viewing distance and luminosity, reveal with greater force and precision the chromatic changes and effects that appear and disappear in the course of the dialogue generated between the viewer and the work, making walking an aesthetic act.The Chromointerferences (1964) result from the superimposition of parallel lines (modules of chromatic events) modulating the colouring of the work according to the distance from which the viewer looks at it. Created during a silk-screening project focusing on Couleur Additive, the artist overlaid a transparent sheet of plastic and observed the colour interferences. These cause blurred vision and generate colour ranges that are invisible on the original medium.The Pyramide Chromointerférente (2007) creates a situation of immateriality, revealing the transfiguration and ambiguity of colour. By projecting moving chromatic interference modules onto the volume, the pyramid becomes transparent and virtually changes shape and condition.The Transchromies (1965) are based on the behaviour of colour by subtraction. Transparent coloured slats are used at different distances and in a specific order to play on the intensity of the light and the ambient colour. The resulting modular transparency allows the viewer to see partially through the colours.About the artist:Cruz-Diez’s work has been the subject of numerous solo and group exhibitions around the world.

Suspended Perimeter – Love Difference is an example of this: this work, composed of a series of mirrors placed in a circle, aims to reflect on the concept of humanity, sublimating the differences to be found both in individuals and social groups. Another example is Labirinto e Grande Pozzo which is capable of simultaneously provoking disorientation and will power. In the middle of the work there is a well, its bottom made of mirror that leads to a losing of the self and a consequent promise of future discoveries.A recurrent symbol is the Terzo Paradiso; made up of a reconfiguration of the mathematic infinity symbol, it represents a fundamental concept in Pistoletto’s artistic practice, which is based on the fusion of the “First Paradise” (in which human beings were completely integrated into nature) with the “Second Paradise” (the artificial world developed through science and technology). The last dimension, depicted in the symbol of a third central circle, represents the third phase of humanity that is realized via creating a balanced connection between artifice and nature, taking the form of a passage to an unprecedented stage of global civilization, indispensable for insuring the human race’s survival.Another important work in the exhibition is Porte Uffizi, an environment that is made up of a series of rooms that hold the names of the various offices of Cittadellarte, a project started by Pistoletto with the intention to inspire and produce a responsible societal change through ideas and initiatives of a creative nature. Each office is dedicated to a specific area: Art, Education, Ecology, Economy, Politics, Spirituality, Production, Work, Communication, Architecture, Fashion and Nutrition. The visitor can subsequently cross over this spatial representation of Cittadellarte’s philosophy that for more than twenty years has operatively brought an artistic intervention into every part of civil society in order to contribute to shaping the deep epochal changes that actually occur.The exhibition continues on the first floor with other works, such as the Quadri Specchianti series that depicts Cuban people, the images for which were selected by the artist after his first trip to Havana in 2014. We then find Mar Mediterraneo founded in 2002 in Biella at Cittadellarte, with the aim of creating new perspectives that transcend cultural diversity borders. Finally, it’s worth mentioning the historic piece Sfera di Giornali, made in the 1960s as a physical articulation of the dynamic and evolving everyday events of the time. At the end of 1967, Pistoletto reproposed this sphere rolling it through Turin, subsequently giving it its name Scultura da passeggio.MICHELANGELO PISTOLETTOMichelangelo Pistoletto was born in Biella in 1933. In 1962 he created the Mirror Paintings with which he quickly achieved international recognition. He is considered one of the precursors and protagonists of Arte Povera with his Oggetti in meno (1965-1966) and the Venere degli stracci (1967). Starting from 1967, outside traditional exhibition spaces, he conceived and created actions that constituted the first manifestations of the “creative collaboration” that he would go on to develop over the following decades, bringing together artists from different disciplines and increasingly wider sectors of society. In the nineties he founded Cittadellarte in Biella, placing art in relation to different areas of society in order to inspire and produce a responsible transformation of society. He has received countless international awards, including the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement of the Venice Biennale in 2003 and in 2007 the Wolf Foundation Prize in Arts “for his constantly creative career as an artist, educator and activator, whose tireless intelligence has given way to premonitory art forms that contribute to a new understanding of the world ”. In 2017 his latest book edited by Actes Sud, Hominitheism and Demopraxy, was released, a manifesto for a regeneration of society published by Chiarelettere. Works by him are present in major contemporary art museums.GALLERIA CONTINUA est ravie de présenter une nouvelle exposition personnelle de l’artiste Michelangelo Pistoletto intitulée 60 Ans d’Identités et d’Altérités, réunissant des travaux tirés de différentes phases du parcours de l’un des protagonistes les plus marquants du mouvement de l’Arte Povera, illustrant le caractère muable de la nature ainsi que la constante évolution des recherches de l’artiste.L’exposition commence à l’extérieur des Moulins avec une œuvre nommée Il tondo delle otto porte, dans laquelle on reconnaît le « Segno Arte », un élément caractérisé par l’intersection de deux triangles qui encadreraient un corps humain dont les bras seraient levés et les jambes écartées. Il s’agit d’un symbole personnel, distinct des symboles religieux, politiques ou publicitaires, qui fournit la clé permettant de franchir la porte de l’art en donnant naissance à un espace intime et partagé.L’exposition se poursuit au rez-de-chaussée. Le visiteur est alors accueilli par de larges installations qui créent un lien entre l’espace et le grand public qui le fréquente, avec notamment l’exemple de Suspended Perimeter – Love Difference: cette œuvre, composée d’une série de miroirs placés en cercle, cherche à refléter le concept d’humanité en sublimant les différences, aussi bien entre les individus qu’entre les groupes sociaux. Ou encore Labirinto e Grande Pozzo, une œuvre capable de provoquer à la fois la désorientation et la volonté. En son sein se trouve un puits dont le fond est composé d’un miroir menant à la perte de soi ainsi qu’à une promesse conséquente de découvertes futures.Le Terzo Paradiso, né d’une reconfiguration du symbole mathématique représentant l’infini, constitue un symbole récurrent. Il représente un concept clé de la pratique artistique de Pistoletto : la fusion entre le « Premier Paradis » (où les êtres humains étaient entièrement intégrés dans la nature) et le « Deuxième Paradis » (le monde artificiel développé par le biais de la science et de la technologie). La dernière dimension, représentée par un troisième cercle central, représente la troisième phase de l’humanité, dans laquelle un équilibre se crée entre artifice et nature. Elle représente le passage de la civilisation mondiale à un stade sans précédent et indispensable à la survie de la race humaine.Porte Uffizi est également une œuvre importante de l’exposition. Il s’agit d’un environnement composé d’une série de pièces portant le nom des différents départements de la Cittadellarte, un projet entamé par Pistoletto dans le but d’inspirer et de produire un changement sociétal responsable grâce à des idées et des initiatives d’une nature créative. Chaque département est dédié à un domaine particulier: Art, Éducation, Écologie, Politique, Spiritualité, Production, Travail, Communication, Architecture, Mode et Nutrition. Les visiteurs sont ainsi invités à parcourir cette représentation spatiale de la philosophie de la Cittadellarte qui, depuis plus de vingt ans, engendre de manière opérationnelle une intervention artistique dans tous les domaines de la société civile afin de contribuer à la formation des changements profonds et marquants qui se produisent.L’exposition se poursuit au premier étage avec d’autres œuvres, telles que la série Quadri Specchianti qui dépeint le peuple cubain. Ces images ont été sélectionnées par l’artiste après son premier voyage à La Havane en 2014. On trouve ensuite Mar Mediterraneo, mouvement fondé à Bielle à la Cittadellarte visant à créer de nouvelles perspectives transcendant les frontières de la diversité culturelle. Enfin, Sfera di Giornali est une œuvre historique créée dans les années 60 et définie comme une articulation physique des événements quotidiens, dynamiques et évolutifs de l’époque. À la fin de l’année 1967, Pistoletto a proposé cette sphère à nouveau en la faisant rouler dans les rues de Turin et en l’intitulant par la suite Scultura da passeggio.MICHELANGELO PISTOLETTOMichelangelo Pistoletto est né à Biella en 1933. En 1962, il crée les Tableaux-miroirs avec lesquelles il obtient rapidement une reconnaissance internationale. Il est considéré comme l’un des précurseurs et protagonistes de l’Arte Povera avec ses Oggetti in meno (1965-1966) et la Venere degli stracci (1967). À partir de 1967, en dehors des espaces d’exposition traditionnels, il conçoit et réalise des actions qui constituent les premières manifestations de la “collaboration créative” qu’il va développer au cours des décennies suivantes, en réunissant des artistes de différentes disciplines et des secteurs de plus en plus larges de la société. Dans les années 90, il fonde la Cittadellarte à Biella, plaçant l’art en relation avec différents domaines de la société afin d’inspirer et de produire une transformation responsable de la société. Il a reçu d’innombrables prix internationaux, dont le Lion d’or pour l’ensemble de sa carrière à la Biennale de Venise en 2003 et, en 2007, le prix de la Fondation Wolf pour les arts “ pour sa carrière constamment créative d’artiste, d’éducateur et d’activateur, dont l’intelligence infatigable a donné lieu à des formes d’art prémonitoires qui contribuent à une nouvelle compréhension du monde “. En 2017 est sorti son dernier livre, Hominithéisme et Démopraxie, édité par Actes Sud, un manifeste pour une régénération de la société publié aux éditions Chiarelettere.

These range across a variety of formats and media: acrylic paintings on canvas from iconic series, two- and three-dimensional modulations and contortions in stainless steel, wood or metal, works from the Lumières series, both historical and recent, and a monumental installation over five metres high. The exhibition is complemented by a unique virtual reality experience.Aurora opens on the ground floor of the Moulin de Boissy with a display of paintings on canvas in full colour, paying tribute to the beauty and complexity of Julio Le Parc’s systems, based on the notion of surface, including pieces from Series 15, which he began in the early 1970s. Le Parc extended his research to include colour in 1959. Not only did the artist any trace of manual execution, of “brushstrokes”, but also any subjective composition. He chose fourteen colours, which he felt summed up all the possible variations of chromatic mixtures, and used them pure, uncut with black or white. Using this chromatic spectrum as a starting point, he created increasingly complex combinations, based on systems that were both rigorous and simple. Starting with one or two horizontally shifting spectra, the artist superimposed four spectra developed vertically, horizontally or diagonally, and sometimes four new spectra as well.The major work in the exhibition, consisting of ten paintings measuring two metres by two metres, La Longue Marche [The Long Walk] was created in 1974, following an aborted project for a major retrospective at the Paris Musée d’Art Moderne, which Le Parc decided not to participate in by a coin toss. The work stands out for its monumentality. It uses the fourteen-colour system of the chromatic prism in prismatic meshes that unfold in fluid, sinuous sequences, exploring the visual effects of superimposition, weaving and overlapping. There is very little hierarchy in the organisation of the pictorial field. There is no dominant element, no centre from which the shapes radiate.Representative of the artist’s experiments with mobile elements, the monumental installation Zepelín de acero [Steel Zeppelin], dating from 2021, presented for the first time at the Fondation Hermès in Tokyo and previously unseen in France, reinterprets the use of light boxes characteristic of the artist’s research into the medium of installation, this time obscured by the steel of which they are composed. In this way, he questions a series of issues: the diversity of situations within a single experience, notions of movement, instability and probability, and the consideration of contingencies external to the work, in a characteristic distancing of his work from the notion of a stable, unique and definitive body of artwork.The exhibition continues on the first floor of the Moulin de Boissy with a selection of works entitled Modulations, in two or three dimensions and in relief, all in shades of black and white, covering a period from 1965 to 2019.The Modulations are part of a series of experiments that began in late 1974, the theme of which is rooted in the last elements treated with fourteen colour- spectrum, as well as in the research into real volumes made by the artist since 1960. The technique he used (air brush, spray paint) produced a gradation from dark to light and a fairly precise modulation of the surface, leading him to develop new themes and explore a new field of research. In continuing the artist’s experiments with the plane, these works continue to be based on simple systems of organisation, the correlation of forms depending on the same principle in each case. In this way, the artist sought to challenge his certainties, while rigorously continuing to subject his discoveries to reflection and analysis.A major contribution to recent developments in Le Parc’s work, the contortions on show (Torsion 1 to 4, dating from 2004, and Formes en contorsion [Shapes in Contorsion], 2019) are exceptional in that they demonstrate the play of chance, the play of light and the surprise of movement. This emblematic movement infused into the form has its origins in certain sets of works from the Mouvements surprise series. The process uses flexible ribbons of mirrored steel forming circles on a black background, in front of which they slowly deform due to a mechanical action coordinated by motors of different speeds.In the Moulin de Boissy’s darkroom, the exhibition also features a selection of light works rarely shown together in France, including Continuel lumière mobile [Continual Light Mobile] (1963-2013), Continuel lumière boîte [Continual light box] (1959-1965) and Continuel lumière avec quatre formes en contorsion [Continual Light with Four Shapes in Contortion] (1966-2012). Begun in late 1959, Le Parc’s experiments with light scatter light rays into small boxes, the aim of which is to reproduce, multiply and combine squares and circles using the fourteen colour-spectrum, by means of screens made from Plexiglas sheets in the shape of prisms.The artist’s aim is to capture the potential for chromatic variations thus created, and to manifest them in a single visual field. Anchored in movement, these experiments are in keeping with the artist’s principle of distancing himself from a fixed, stable and definitive body of work. The viewer is captivated by the development of a multitude of changes, the uniform medium of the elements or forms accentuating the highlighted instability. These works are characterised by their structure and, at the same time, by the absence of any composition.To complement the exhibition, GALLERIA CONTINUA is presenting for the first time Julio le Parc’s VIRTUAL LABYRINTHUS MUSEUM project through a virtual reality device. Designed by Julio Le Parc in collaboration with Juan Le Parc, using programming tools derived from video games, Julio Le Parc’s VIRTUAL LABYRINTHUS MUSEUM offers an interactive visit to a virtual museum space comprising five levels, corresponding to Le Parc’s five pictorial periods: Surfaces, Surface - couleur [colour], Modulation 1, Modulation 2, and Alchimie [Alchemy].Julio Le Parc (born 1928 in Mendoza, Argentina, and has lived and worked in Cachan, France since 1958), a major figure within kinetic and contemporary art, was one of the co-founders of the Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel (GRAV) in Paris in 1960, alongside Horacio Garcia Rossi, Francisco Sobrino, François Morellet, Joël Stein and Jean-Pierre Vasarely (Yvaral).The artist has participated in numerous solo exhibitions at leading museums and institutions such as Palais de Tokyo, Paris; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Perez Art Museum, Miami and Serpentine Gallery, London, among others. This socially committed artist and defender of human rights fought against the dictatorship in Latin America, and was temporarily expelled from France in May 1968 after taking part in the Atelier Populaire protest group and its demonstrations against the major institutions.Artistic director: Yamil le ParcStudio and Team Manager: Eduardo Berrelleza",Julio Le Parc: Aurora,"46 rue de la Ferté Gaucher, 77169",Wed-Sun 12-6pm, 17 Sep 2023 -

Thousands of threads must come together to dress or cover us. But sometimes, the thread no longer wants company. It sets off alone to trace a beautiful route. It becomes a line; it travels the world. In awe, we watch it drift away, following the shapes of a river, taking the curves of a tree, or drawing even the engine of a ship. Yet the thread never forgets us.

On this occasion, GALLERIA CONTINUA would like to thank the artists, craftspeople, curators, professionals, institutions, collectors and everyone else who has supported its project over the years, as well as the entire gallery team for its passionate work and unstinting commitment, and of course the public who passes through the doors of its eight spaces around the world every day.From 3 June 2023 at Les Moulins, before the Paris and CILA chapters, GALLERIA CONTINUA invites you on an artistic journey through time and space, giving mind and body to the words of its three founders, and devoting an unprecedented and abundant platform to thirty years of work and passion. To give colour to the ephemera of ideas, thoughts and sensations accumulated over the years, this narrative celebrates three feelings - art, love and friendship - divided into three temporal axes - past, present and future.The Ability to Dream pays homage to all the gallery’s artists with major pieces revolving around these values, which will be repeated in the following chapters in Paris and Fontvieille. It is thanks to each of them, to the mark they have left, to their contribution, to the paths they have opened up, that the history of the gallery has been written, borrowing different silhouettes, shapes, colours and languages.The Ability to Dream presents a body of work that includes all the artists who have accompanied the gallery on this journey from the outset, as well as those who have joined more recently. Each work on display bears witness to the unique bond that has developed over the years between GALLERIA CONTINUA and the nearly seventy artists it has accompanied, to give concrete expression to the gallery’s fundamental purpose: to be a meeting point for everyone, through art and creation. Over the course of its three chapters, The Ability to Dream will invite visitors to an immersive experience made up of unusual objects, fantastical characters and installations that play with light and colour or defy the laws of physics, space and time.GALLERIA CONTINUA opened its doors in San Gimignano in 1990, the brainchild of three young friends who began their adventure in a space on Via della Rocca, in this village in the heart of Tuscany, with the aim of bringing contemporary art to a rural setting, far from the hustle and bustle of the metropolises and major cultural centres. The name of the gallery was born of the desire of the three founders to enhance the link between past, present and future, an ambition shared by all the spaces opened by the gallery around the world over the years.GALLERIA CONTINUA has expanded over the last thirty-two years and now has eight sites on five continents. It was the first foreign gallery with an international programme to open in China in 2004, before inaugurating its Les Moulins space in the Paris countryside three years later, a monumental showcase for major interventions and exhibitions. In 2015, the gallery embarked on a new journey to Havana, Cuba, with the aim of transcending all types of borders. In 2020, the gallery opened a new exhibition space in Rome, inside the St. Regis Hotel, as well as another in Brazil, in the Pacaembu sports complex (São Paulo), an inclusive space far removed from the canons of the white cube gallery. In 2021, the gallery moved to the heart of Paris, in the Marais district, with an exhibition space, a grocery shop offering exceptional products from all the countries where the gallery is based, and an ice-cream counter by Gelateria Dondoli. Also in 2021, the gallery opened a new space in Dubai, at the Burj al-Arab, an iconic sail-shaped building located near Jumeirah beach.Since its opening in 2007, GALLERIA CONTINUA / Les Moulins (The Paper Mills) has taken on a special place in the history of the gallery. Located in Boissy-le-Châtel, in the Grand Morin valley near Coulommiers, the Moulin de Boissy, 46 rue de la Ferté Gaucher, and the Moulin de Sainte-Marie, 48 rue des Papeteries, the paper mills have a rich industrial history, with the first written records dating back to the 14th century. GALLERIA CONTINUA / Les Moulins features permanent installations by iconic international contemporary artists represented by the gallery, including Anish Kapoor, Daniel Buren and Pascale Marthine Tayou.The gallery’s first space in France, this monumental and unique forty-thousand square metre space has become a creative incubator, giving rise to exceptional site-specific productions and avant-garde projects, as well as a pioneering art education programme. With free, open access, this space has been dedicated since the beginning to sharing culture with as many people as possible since it opened, by being open to the area, its residents and its schools on a daily basis, and welcoming a diversity of uses and practices, with its skatepark and relaxation areas. Over the years, the space itself has become the protagonist of certain works, which are revived today in the exhibition.In this way, GALLERIA CONTINUA demonstrates its sensitivity to contemporary creative practices by preserving the link between the past and the future. The Ability to Dream celebrates the diversity of places, cultures, individuals and communities that host and animate it, and give it its raison d’être.A second chapter will be presented at GALLERIA CONTINUA / Paris 23 June to 21 September 2023 before a third chapter at the Centre Interculturel Leila Alaoui (CILA) in Fontvieille from 8 July to 10 September 2023.",The Ability to Dream,"46 rue de la Ferté Gaucher, 77169",Wed-Sun 12-6pm, 3 Jun 2023 -

The subjects of her work have often been partial views of internal spaces, some remembered and others imagined. In her new paintings thresholds, edges and apertures are sometimes visible, but more often than not are pushed to the sides, leading to increasing abstraction.Central for Parsons is that the paintings convey a much larger sense of scale and space than their small size might initially suggest. In some works, space is shaped and defined by lines and structures that recall architectural elements, while in others Parsons uses paint to veil or shadow interiors that can be glimpsed beneath. More recent paintings encourage space to expand and grow and creep towards the borders of the panel. As the limits of space are stretched, pulsating colour or soft yet luminous horizons reminiscent of the landscape are revealed, and the texture of paint and the mark of the brush become core elements of the visual field. In one of the most recent paintings in the exhibition, a white light pushes towards the foreground and almost dissolves its marked boundary.In a recent text on Parsons’ work, writer and poet Rachel Spence has described the paintings as visual poems: “Delicate, diminutive, measured, rhythmically playful but strict on internal structure. Withholding clarity to open the way towards a more enduring light. Our gaze narrows to look at them just as our ear quickens to catch poetry’s music. We peer. Lean closer. Pause. Painting as comma of time as well as occupier of space.”Vicken Parsons: Time coincides with the publication of the artist’s first retrospective monograph, a 296-page publication featuring works from throughout her career including drawings, paintings and sculpture. Texts by fellow artists and writers from the fields of art, psychoanalysis and literature include contributions from Michael Archer, David Batchelor, Iwona Blazwick, Edmund de Waal and Darian Leader.Vicken Parsons (b.1957, Hertfordshire) lives and works in London.

(Just what is it that makes this avant-gardist so different, so appealing?) This anniversary exhibition extends the inquiry by presenting 5 works by Francis Picabia, alongside 24 contemporary artists, each of whom have been inspired by Picabia in a variety of ways: As an almost limitless repertoire of formal and conceptual techniques; a satirist, parodist and avatar of play; a protean but self-deprecating spirit of myriad possibilities and potentials. If critics still often struggle to make sense of Picabia’s achievement, and only intermittently embrace its profuse permissive gifts, artists, on the other hand, have definitely always gotten the message, celebrated it, and enthusiastically extended it. This exhibition gives voice to their energies and insights.Trey Abdella, Rita Ackermann, Barbara Bloom, John Cage, John Currin Nancy Dwyer, Louis Eisner, Tomás Esson, Ravi Jackson, Lisa Jo, Martin Kippenberger, Colette Lumiere, Claire Lehmann, Mathieu Malouf, Charles Mayton, Jeanette Mundt, Francis Picabia, Philip Pearlstein, Jason Rhoades, Anita Steckel, Marika Thunder, Kyle Thurman, Christopher Williams, Lisa Yuskavage, Leah Ke Yi Zheng.",Everyone Loves Picabia,"57 Walker Street, NY 10013",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 3 May  - 19 Jul 2024  
David Nolan Gallery,New York Upper East Side,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/enrico-baj-alter-ego-and-other-hypotheses/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Enrico Baj,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/enrico-baj/,"With a passion for the eccentric and a strong iconoclastic impulse, Enrico Baj (1924-2003) was one of the central figures of the Italian neo-avant-garde. His art and writings played an instrumental role in influential movements, from Dada and Surrealism to Art Informel and CoBrA, as well as the Nuclear Art movement, which he cofounded in Milan in 1951. Heir to the Surrealist-Dadaist spirit, and an experimenter in original techniques and styles, he departed from gestural abstraction in the mid-1950s and honed an idiosyncratic iconography for his paintings, drawings, collages, objects, and sculptures, defiantly embracing figuration and kitsch symbols, and subverting conventions.Titled after Alterego e altre ipotesi, a publication which Enrico Baj designed in collaboration with Italian poet and art critic Roberto Sanesi in 1970, this exhibition features Baj's work in dialogue with artists who influenced his oeuvre, and with artists from younger generations with whom we’d like to imagine him in conversation today.Baj’s oeuvre bears a distinctly political slant, most glaringly in his Generals and Ladies series. The Generals are pseudo-portraits of military generals, formulated from the details of a military uniform; the Ladies, their wives, composed of the debris of a household and its upkeep. Baj mocks the grandiose self-image of the military general, as well as the outrageous performance required of aristocratic society. His unique form of artistic rebellion stands out from that of his contemporaries; it is perhaps most comparable to the anti-establishment attitude and style of Jean Dubuffet.It’s intriguing to note the connections between Baj and his contemporaries. Active in the Milan art scene, Baj engaged and showed alongside artists like Francis Picabia, Marcel Duchamp, and Lucio Fontana. For example, Baj owned at least three of Picabia’s works, one directly acquired from the artist himself.His encounter with Asger Jorn in 1953 led to the establishment of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus opposing the rationalization of art. Collaborating not only ideologically but also artistically, Baj and Jorn worked together on Jorn’s well-known Modifications series. Modifications revised found kitsch paintings, emphasizing the critique inherent in appropriating low-brow artwork.Before meeting Marcel Duchamp, Baj belonged to a generation of artists revisiting the Dadaist’s work upon the publication of Duchamp’s writings and monograph in the late 1950s. Baj exhibited in the 1960 International Surrealist Exhibition, which Duchamp co-curated with André Breton, proving the awareness was mutual.Duchamp and Baj finally met on Baj’s trip to New York in 1961 for the MoMA exhibition The Art of Assemblage. Baj and Duchamp, both participating in the landmark show, struck up a close friendship that would lead to support of each other’s careers and, eventually, artistic collaboration on a 1965 version of Duchamp’s L.H.O.O.Q. Their friendship, along with their shared sense of humor and embrace of the banal, established a living connection between Duchamp’s Dada and Baj’s Neo-Dada.What united these artists - Duchamp, Picabia, Jorn, Baj - was the humor and double entendre present in their works, rooted in the observation of real-life while overlapping with several different Modern/Post-War movements.André Breton was also friends with Baj; Breton consistently invited Baj to exhibit with the Surrealist Movement. Breton, a prolific writer and poet, penned a lengthy essay about Baj, which was published in the third edition of Breton’s book Le Surréalisme et la Peinture. Baj’s relationship with Breton and acceptance into Surrealist institutions validates his enormous range as an artist and his category-defying legacy. Baj maintained close ties with the pioneers of Dada and Surrealism, co-founding the Pataphysic Institute of Milan in 1963, an Italian equivalent of the Parisian College de Pataphysique de France, with Man Ray and others.In addition, Breton and Max Ernst avidly collected Native American art, and frequently showed katsina dolls alongside their own works in several notable exhibitions. It is possible, even likely, that Baj encountered these dolls at their homes. Katsina dolls, known as tithu to the Hopi, are visual representations of the katsinam, the essential life force of all animate beings. The dolls unite the creative and the utilitarian, serving as a method of spiritual relief from the demands of modern life. Baj related to his art in a similar manner, channeling the raw elements of his lived experience into his work.Lucio Fontana, another friend of Baj, coproduced the work Attese (Waitings) with the artist in 1959. Fontana and Baj exhibited together frequently, often in Milan; the association between the two continues until today, with a 2020 exhibition at Mazzoleni in Turin grouping Fontana, Baj, and Piero Manzoni. The trio were close; for example, the three artists collaborated on Baj’s periodical, Il Gesto, in 1955.William Copley and Baj mesh stylistically in their collage-like aesthetic and adoption of bright color. In 1959, the two created at least two artworks together, Personaggi e segnali and Gli amanti. This sort of artistic communion typifies the exchange occurring within the network of artists surrounding both Baj and Copley, another example of which presents itself in the artistic interpretations Baj made of his fellow artists in works like Bonjour Max Ernst (1975) and Ritratto di Lucio Fontana.Baj also influenced younger artists such as Martin Kippenberger, Mike Kelley, and Jonathan Meese. Ever since his participation in the Venice Biennale in 1964, Baj’s artwork has been exhibited in all the major European museums and frequently in the United States since 1960.With additional works by:Richard ArtschwagerKerstin BrätschWilliam CopleyMarcel DuchampNicole EisenmanAsger JornMartin KippenbergerJonathan MeeseFrancis PicabiaMan Rayand 20th-Century Indigenous Artists",Enrico Baj: Alter Ego and Other Hypotheses,"24 East 81st Street, NY 10028",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 18 Apr  - 31 May 2024  
David Richard Gallery,New York Chelsea,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/nate-ethier-heavy-light/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Nathan Ethier,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/nate-ethier/,"Layering of saturated and desaturated colors using meticulously applied translucent glazes with overlapping and opposing horizontal and vertical brush strokes that emulate the warp and weft of woven textiles in an overall canvas-filling pattern has been a mainstay of Ethier’s studio practice for years. While the process and use of all over patterns remains constant, the key feature in this newest body of work is the presence of a centrally located focal point comprised of bright and vividly colored rectilinear and curvilinear shapes against a background of all over geometric forms and patterns in desaturated hues of complimentary and tonal values.Ethier achieves compositional harmonies through his all-over patterned grounds that persist in form, thus anchoring the composition, while varying in the upper most hues that the viewer sees through the building of successive layers of translucent color applied selectively in newly applied shapes over the surface of the canvas as noted above. The new brighter and vividly colored focal point, the “figure” in the parlance of “figure-ground” relationships, emerges from the ground through this sequential process of adding additional patterns of new curved and geometric shapes and leveraging color theory to achieve harmonic palettes. Sometimes the shapes of the ground remain as grids of squares or rotated to create diamond shapes and grided patterns.According to Ethier in a recent written statement: “The compositions of these pictures are simultaneously ‘all over’, and not. The collections of illuminated shapes seem to disrupt the underlying grid; however, they depend on its very structure to exist as part of the image. These paintings are hard edge and soft edge, all at once.”Reminiscent of Julian Stanczak, the important color abstract painter famous for his optical and illusory compositions in the 1960s and 70s, and his approach to sequentially layering colors on top of the patterned layer below using masking tape to successively reveal only the shapes to be painted with the new hue. The difference is Stanczak almost always used opaque colors to cover over selective portions of the grid of colors below. Ethier, however, uses translucent colors so that the color below becomes part of and transformed selectively into a different color specifically within the desired shape that, in his case, will become part of the emerging figure in the ultimate foreground. Another interesting comparison between the generationally diverse artists is the repetition of certain small motifs or structures of contrasting colors that are uniformly gridded or patterned across the canvas surface. Stanczak referred to these as “activation elements” because they excite the viewer’s eye, causing the brain to try and make sense of the frenetic marks which in turn makes the viewer more susceptible to the power of suggestion. In other words, the activation elements help challenge the viewer’s visual perception.The final additions in Ethier’s newest paintings are often large circular discs, ovals, squares, or teardrops in specific arrays and highly contrasting translucent hues of lavender, light grey, bright amber, or lighter values of colors within the composition to either elevate the centrally located figure by framing it or directionally drawing the viewer’s eye to it, or even veiling and slightly obfuscating the figure. In the painting, “Magical Thinking” the large discs on the upper-most layer of canvas gives the figure a slight anthropomorphic reference, it almost appears as the head and eyes of an owl.The centrally located figures are interesting shapes in and of themselves, moving the compositions into an optical and illusory aesthetic and making the viewer ponder astral, mystical, or existential realms. The most dimensional of the structures is the bi-partite curvaceous structure resembling a spinning top or dumbbells, possibly even an electron map (for the chemists out there). The interior shapes and patterning utilize a curved dome-shaped form that reads as a sliver off the edge of a circle and provides powerful kinetic, whirling, and illusory imagery. Other structures of the figure range from spherical orbs that are floating freely or slightly resting upon the dumbbell structure noted above or just a portion of it such that there is a slight botanical nod to perhaps the pedicle of a flower or fruiting structures. Still, in others, the sphere morphs into an oval or elliptical shape. Again, the combination of the high contrast, high-key colors and curves of the interior shapes and patterns imbue the structures with pulsating and spinning kinetic movement.Ethier recently commented on his sources of inspiration, “Inspiration for the shapes and motifs at play in this work came from the dappling effect of sunlight through forest canopies, stained glass arrangements, mycology, sun angle charts, wind patterns, bird murmuration, the Moon, concert lighting, botanical order, loud music on a clear day, and surely many other subconscious interventions.”The artist’s title for the exhibition, “Heavy Light”, is an interesting play on words. It could be that both “heavy” and “light’ pertain to weight, either as a physical mass or visual size of an artwork on a wall and within a space, meaning the painting’s pictorial impact. If “heavy” is an adjective modifying “light” then that could imply the paintings are very luminous, bright and radiant. Actually, both interpretations are true and apply to Ethier’s paintings. His command of color and intuition for juxtaposing hues to leverage interactions and optical effects creates the internal energy and sets the mood for each painting. To that end, Ethier recently wrote, “The illusion of projected light conveyed in my pictures gives each one of them a sense of life, action, and exuberant coexistence with the viewer.”About Nathan Ethier:Nate Ethier’s artworks have been exhibited at Auxier/Kline, NY; Danese/Corey, NY; LMAKgallery, NY; Minus Space, NY; Geoffery Young Gallery, MA; Nancy Margois Gallery, NY; The Boiler/Pierogi Gallery, NY; Morgan Lehman Gallery, NY; and at institutes such as the Susquehanna Art Museum, PA; Boston University, MA; Georgia Southern Univeristy, GA.

While this early pairing explored their mutual penchant for versatile experimentation related to temporal and spatial relationships, Enchanted Reverie seeks instead to emphasize their respective investigations and interests in natural forms and kinetic energies. The works of Klee and Calder are placed in conversation once more, in an exhibition designed as a dreamlike realm where rare masterpieces by each artist are meaningfully presented to illustrate their explorations of the spiritual and unknown.In a 1962 interview, Calder was asked, “What artists do you most admire?” He replied, “Goya, Miró, Matisse, Bosch and Klee.”[1] These artists shared a commonality — namely the ability to conceptualize existence without heavy, dramatic overtones, but rather with a rhythmic lightness and vibrancy. Calder likely viewed Klee as a Modern master of this feat, whose lyrical investigations of space and form were inspirational.A prolific creator, Klee’s works are cornerstones of nearly every major institutional collection. He continually demonstrated a masterful command of line and color, revealing the intricate connections that both capture and bind us to the concrete and metaphysical realms. For Klee, natural phenomena served as a metaphor for both artistic and cosmic creation. In his Creative Credo V (1920), Klee furthers this notion, stating, “formerly we used to represent things which were visible on earth… we reveal the reality that is behind visible things, thus expressing the belief that the visible world is merely an isolated case in relation to the universe and that there are many more other, latent realities.”[2]Though part of the subsequent generation, Calder's nonobjective sculptures exploit atmospheric effects to engage time and space within and beyond the human realm. His diverse body of work, celebrated in public collections and commissions throughout the world, transports viewers into the fourth dimension, evoking notions of immateriality and the sublime. In a 1946 catalogue essay, Jean-Paul Sartre wrote: “Although Calder has not sought to imitate anything ... his mobiles are at once lyrical inventions, technical, almost mathematical combinations and the tangible symbol of Nature, of that great, vague Nature that squanders pollen and suddenly causes a thousand butterflies to take wing.”The exhibition includes loans from distinguished private collections and international institutions including the Fondation Beyeler, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago, as well as an impressive selection of works from the Calder Foundation. Enchanted Reverie: Klee and Calder will be accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue featuring a selected chronology and major essays written by the historian Olivier Berggruen and Dr. Elizabeth Hutton Turner, renowned specialists in the emergence and development of Modern and Post-War art.[1] Katharine Kuh, “Alexander Calder” in The Artist’s Voice: Talks with Seventeen Artists (New York: Harper & Row, 1962), 39.[2] Paul Klee, “Creative Credo V” in Tribune der Kunst und Zeit (Berlin: Erich Reiss Verlag, 1920).",Enchanted Reverie: Klee and Calder,"744 Madison Avenue, NY 10065","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm by timed reservation", 19 Apr  - 8 Jun 2024

Minimalism was born in the '60s, a time when artists often emerged as ""collectives"" of genres and styles.But in today's globalized world, the post-Internet era differentiates individuals. Even as a curator, I can't classify and summarize the six young post-90s artists in this exhibition. Of course, even if they could, I believe they would refuse to be labeled uniformly. So, whether this exhibition is a tribute to the great and forward-thinking exhibition of 58 years ago or the hope for the future of the six participating artists, I have dared to set the theme of this exhibition as ""Respective Structures: The Quest of Young Artists"".Why Respective?Born in 1993 in Chaozhou, Guangdong Province, artist Cai Jian uses computer drawings without any hand-drawn drafts. To him, car airbrushes replaced paintbrushes. The surface of his works is so clear that they don't look like they were painted. From a distance, they look like prints, but even if you observe closely, you are still unable to find a definite answer. Regardless, you will always be ""captured"" by his work at first sight. It is foreseeable that the pace of human pursuit of visual stimulation will never stop, and Cai Jian is wandering freely in it.Born in 1995 in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, artist Ding HongDan has a ""pure pedigree"", her 14-year study career covers the CAFA High School, CAFA undergraduate, CAFA graduate, and CAFA Ph.D., as a close disciple of the painter Liu Xiaodong, Ding Hongdan inherits the solid techniques of the academic school, which are based on a highly personalized private perspective to depict the female images around her, compared with the style of ""private photography"", she seems to be in an exploration of ""private painting"".Born in 1994 in Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, artist Huang Bingjie is not only a painter but also an ""Internet celebrity"". Five to six years ago, she became an art blogger on social media, posting art content related to paintings, visuals, art criticism, etc., which amassed many readers. Taking some time out every day to input learning through the output content, Huang Bingjie admits that being a blogger provides a lot of knowledge that cannot be learned in the Academy of Fine Arts. After countless studies and learning about predecessors, she continued to find the meaning of painting in her self-evolution.Born in Beijing in 1993, Jing Ao graduated from Goldsmiths, University of London with a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from the Royal College of Art. In her early work, she focused on the relationship between behavior and the body. Nowadays, many viewers are at a loss when viewing her sculptures and installations, and they are unable to define his works in the first place. I asked Jing Ao about her take on what to do if the audience wanted to know what your creation was expressing. ""I just kept trying to solve my own problems,"" she said. If the works are understandable was never in her consideration.Born in Beijing in 2001, Wenjue is the youngest artist in this exhibition, but his life experience is extraordinarily rich. After dropping out of an international school at the age of 14, he and his parents traveled around Europe and studied in Paris. His work also wanders through contemporary and classical, two-dimensional and three-dimensional, realistic and fantasy. These elements are all intertwined in the phantom constructed by Wenjue, making the audience linger.Born in Yantai City, Shandong Province in 1998, Xu Haoyang has been busy preparing for a Ph.D. admission. He has been passionate about comics and movies since he was a child, and in the previous stage of creation, he often incorporated film shots into the picture, and the atmosphere of lust, violence, and suspense jumped on the page. And Xu Haoyang, who quickly found his style, is looking for the focus behind the style.The six participating artists are very different in age, origin, hobbies, experiences, thoughts, etc., so they can only represent themselves, express themselves, and become themselves. They have their own knowledge structure and growth structure. EACH MODERN and I both believe that each artist is a sample of this era, and each sample reflects a cross-section of the era. And the various cross-sections make up this complex era that cannot be defined. Today, we present a cross-section of 6 artists to a Taiwanese audience. This is their time we are witnessing, which is also our own.Curator: Qi Chao on March 14, 2024",Respective Structures: The Quest of Young Artists,"3F, 97 Sec. 2 DunHua S.

Her work immerses the viewer in a world of repeated imagery, signs, and symbols, a labyrinth of spaces and places, combining layers, forms, and elements. The artist blends dream-like visions and narratives that merge the every day with the ethereal. This is explored with pictorial tropes such as indoor scenes, plants, flowers, clouds, animals, and textiles, which are remembered, imagined, or inspired by researched source material.“Spaces and moods in my paintings have been influenced by the environment in which I grew up and the kind of places I feel to be important…spaces in [my] paintings are collages of metaphysical and psychological elements; they do not just reflect just one place or experience’’, Hellberg explains.Hellberg paints the space between memories and fantasies, heightened by her recurring use of intense colour throughout her works. Confident yet sensual brush strokes merge the foreground and background, highlighting areas rich in detail while allowing the works to appear flat and challenge our understanding of how we navigate the physical world. Employing these techniques, Hellberg builds a captivating and enchanting world.The settings depicted in Hellberg’s paintings are often interiors, such as rooms in a home, which act as a container for the elements within them. The works in this upcoming exhibition at Elizabeth Xi Bauer will include spaces between the interior and exterior—for example, the view of a house as seen from a garden looking in. Although an outdoor space, these gardens have still been designed and created by a person. Rather than linear, they operate across multiple levels of time as they are a mixture of real, remembered, and imaginary places. Hellberg’s works depict fictional spaces that interpret instances or objects that originate in reality. The artist omits human figures from her works and instead portrays objects and elements brought in or discarded by humankind. In Hellberg’s works, the ghosts of human presence remain. “I enjoy the recurring theme of aesthetic ghosts and labyrinths; my paintings are like chapters in a book of short stories”, explains Hellberg.Rather than guiding the viewer, Hellberg wants the audience to have their own understanding when encountering the work and to enjoy losing themselves within it. Whilst the references may be personal or from her research, Hellberg does not always desire to disclose her inspiration by not inflicting her interpretations on the viewer.Hellberg works on one painting at a time, turning other artworks around so she does not see them. The artist does not always finish a painting before deciding to work on another. This allows time to reflect and continue working on another canvas, returning to the other paintings later. This intense focus is reflected in her works.“It’s more like one thing leads to another; you can’t predict all the choices you’ll make in a painting, how you will feel about it or what you might need to solve in the painting”, Hellberg explains.This upcoming exhibition of new works by Karoliina Hellberg at Elizabeth Xi Bauer will include large canvases, smaller paintings, framed watercolours, and prints in a wallpaper format, the latter of which the artist has received a grant to create from Arts Promotion Centre Finland (Taike). These wallpaper prints will serve as an accent feature, exploring the motifs embedded within Hellberg’s works. The familiarity of wallpaper further layers and extends Hellberg’s depiction of domestic settings. This new wallpaper is similar to a project by Hellberg, commissioned by the Didrichsen Museum, upon her receiving the Pro Arte prize in 2018. This 2019 solo exhibition at the Didrichsen Museum was the first time Hellberg created and executed her wallpaper prints. The artist included new wallpaper prints in exhibitions at Galerie Anhava, Helsinki, Finland, and Galleri KANT, Copenhagen, Denmark.The exhibition will be curated by Maria do Carmo M.

In the years leading up to 80, I have spent more time reflecting on my life, and generally, what this thing called ‘life’ is all about, than in the creation of artworks. Nonetheless, I have been productive both ideologically and practically in the creation of new works. The range of artworks in this exhibition represent markers of my life as an artist, from my earliest works to my most recent. It is an insight into the evolution of my practice, informed by migration, my travels and the development of technology.My work is rooted in the traditions of pre-colonial Africa and ancient Egypt rather than the Greco Roman art of the West. Finding my calling as a visual artist late in life, I deliberately chose not to be trained in western art institutions as I felt that these institutions could not teach me what I needed to know. They were too deeply entrenched in their own traditions with little or no understanding, or interest in the things that interested me most: which are the ideas that lie behind the prized, yet often unacknowledged art, culture and influence of Africa.As an African, born in the Caribbean under British colonial rule, I was completely cut off from any knowledge of my ancestral home, and completely dominated by western culture; it was important to gain some understanding of my ancestral self. Art was the most accessible way of doing that. Africa and that which was deemed African were things labelled as dark and hidden, to be feared, avoided at all costs.I decided to become an artist whilst in Benin, Nigeria in the mid-1970s, as a touring musician. Whilst there, I believe I experienced a kind of fundamental transformation, or enlightenment. Inspired by the iconic bronze sculptures, I returned to London determined to acquire knowledge of the technique of sculpting, which I was able to find in books and through trial and error. The philosophical aspect came through a deep intuition and repeated journeys across various parts of Africa; Journeys that explored the spiritual side of my ancestral home; this was my art school, my higher education. The intuitive/spiritual aspect of reality still abounds on that Continent.The encounter between the African and the European has brought about deep-rooted spiritual and mental conflicts at the core of the African, along with the commonly held stereotype that the African is nothing more than: “the reflection of a primitive and barbarous mentality.” I believe that this point of view cannot be left unchallenged, and that art has an important role to play in the struggle to define and redefine a contemporary African worldview. He who defines “the story” is the one who controls, and so we are engaged in a struggle to define for ourselves, thereby becoming masters of our own destiny.In today’s African artists’ work we must: see the eyes and hands of the contemporary artist, looking anew, not at, but through the prism of an African aesthetic, speaking in a new world with the voices of the ancestors; voices for so long silenced; in doing so, their art will offer new generations the opportunity to look again with fresh eyes, to see themselves in new ways. The late Professor Stuart Hall wrote this for my inaugural solo exhibition in 1992; it is still relevant today, for me and for many artists of the African Diaspora.Fowokan George Kelly (March 2024)About Fowokan George KellyBorn in Kingston Jamaica in 1943, Fowokan migrated to the UK in 1957, attending secondary school in Brixton where, among his teachers, was Stuart Hall (the late Professor). He became a sculptor after working as a musician, playing with several bands, including Symande. Whilst working as Jimmy Cliff’s sound engineer on his first tour of Nigeria, Fowokan encountered the wealth of sculptures from Benin and Nok. Returning to London, he decided to give up music and taught himself sculpting techniques. As his work gained attention and the quality of his technique improved, he adopted the Yoruba name, ‘Fowokan’, meaning ‘one who works with his hands’. Fowokan has exhibited widely including in the iconic group exhibitions of Black British Artists of the 1980s and 1990s and in their important group exhibition held at the Guildhall Art Gallery in 2015. By Invitation, Fowokan became a member of the Society of Portrait Sculptors, exhibiting in their annual exhibitions, as well as that of annual summer exhibitions held at the Royal Academy. Among his international exhibitions are the Cuban Biennale and the Studio Museum Harlem. Fowokan's works are held in private and public collections in the UK, Europe and the US. Fowokan also expresses his creativity through poetry, prose, photography and videography. His writings have been published and vignettes of his video documentaries have been shown on BBC Breakfast with several on YouTube. His works have featured on television: BBC (Artsnight 2014 and When I came to Britain part 4: 2004) and Chanel 4 (The Empire Pays Back 2005).

Only such a select spirit as his, only such a brush as his, soaked in delicacy, could confront the universal theme of the woman and emerge triumphant."" – J. Mascaro PassariusLluís Ribas was born on December 28, 1949, in Masnou, Spain, a coastal town in the Maresme district near Barcelona. Ribas used to spend hours on the beach drawing in the sand. His mother wished for him to have a better life than that of a fisherman. At the age of nine, he started taking drawing and painting classes with Jose Maris Martinez. When he turned 13, he enrolled in the ""Escuela Massana"" in Barcelona. In 1975, at the age of 25, Ribas held his first solo exhibition, which earned him international recognition. Since then, he has exhibited his works in some of the most prestigious galleries in Europe and the United States. To date, five books have been published about his paintings.Ribas is a well-known contemporary Spanish artist who specializes in luminism. His work is characterized by his profound knowledge of light, shade, and opaqueness. He is particularly skilled at drawing classic female forms with delicate and brilliant execution. Ribas's paintings are profoundly beautiful and feature a wide range of colors that he employs with great care.As the son of fishermen, Ribas learned about the uncertainties of a life dependent on the sea at an early age. Nevertheless, he always felt drawn to the beach as it represented the starting point of an adventure across the waters.As a young artist, Ribas chose the sea, with its continuous harmonic movement, as another favorite theme, which he expresses on his canvas with great emotional precision.Ribas is an artist who values quality over quantity. He prefers to work slowly, continuously refining his vision in an endless pursuit of aesthetics. His career has spanned over twenty years, and his paintings are highly sought after by galleries and collectors alike. Ribas is not a prolific painter, and his disciplined approach to painting requires years of planning for an exhibition.“Ribas has shown his command of technique, his drawing capacity, and his great skill in a wide range of themes – especially the female figure, the touchstone par excellence for all painters.  The figure of the woman, dressed in transparent clothes, facing the sea, caressed by the sun, leaves us in no doubt that he can take on any subject matter that he pleases. Only when you love something, when you feel it in your heart, can you translate it on to canvas the way Lluis Ribas  does. And he converts each of his canvases into a study of light; blending the tone, working the material, capturing not only the reality, which is the guideline Ribas always maintains, but also the special atmosphere which pervades all of his paintings. His brushwork is insistent, and carries out work that is almost that of a miniaturist, uninvolved with the passage of time.  In each of his paintings, Ribas knows just how far to go, knows when just one more brushstroke could shatter the magic charm of the canvas. Reality immersed in atmosphere prevails in all of his paintings.  Light penetrates the canvas and become a neutral fundamental element; it is the creator of transparency and reflected sunlight, ennobling all that is beautiful, founding and settling the deep human breath which beats in each and every canvas of Ribas.” – Joan Llop",Lluís Ribas,"165 Worth Avenue, 33480",Mon-Sat 10am-6pm, 6 Apr -

Cottingham is considered part of the first generation of Photorealists along with Chuck Close, Richard Estes and John DeAndrea.When Cottingham was twelve years old in 1947, he visited New York City with his father, experiencing the grand vibrations of destinations like Times Square for the first time. He had a similar revelation when seeing Edward Hopper at the Whitney Museum of American Art through his television that same year. Encounters such as these would be hugely decisive for him later in life. Fascinated by the typography that decorated the visual landscape of the United States, Cottingham began a career as an art director for the New York advertising agency Young and Rubicam. He was eventually relocated to Los Angeles, where the kitschy relics of bygone eras and a radical atmosphere ignited a spark within him and encouraged him to paint every day after work. This is when Cottingham began taking his art seriously, creating one of his very first paintings, Bus II, in 1965, which is included in this exhibition after previously being shown at our booth at TEFAF New York, 2024. In 1968, Cottingham left advertising behind, devoting all his time to his art.The term Photorealism refers to the great value of photography within an artist’s technique, something that Cottingham’s practice majorly revolves around. By translating a photograph into a black and white study, Cottingham captivates realistic shadows and details in his images. After this step, a subsequent colored study is brought to life. His method then involves projecting these gridded studies onto a canvas, utilizing them as guides that allow for the achievement of Photorealism. Cottingham has often rejected this label, however, as he does not view his works as mere reproductions of reality, but more so reinterpretations, sometimes even going as far as consciously altering words in his facades, thus reimagining their meanings. The iconography of Cottingham’s works irrefutably captivates the American vernacular through recognizable motifs and nostalgic commercial landscapes.This exhibition will be accompanied by an illustrated publication.Robert Cottingham (Brooklyn, New York, b. 1935) has been represented by Galerie Georges-Philippe & Nathalie Vallois since 2019. He has been featured in group exhibitions including Hyperréalistes Americains - Réalistes Européens, Centre National d’Art Contemporain, Paris (1974); Art About Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1978); Robert Bechtle, Chuck Close, Robert Cottingham, Malcolm Morley, Sigmar Polke, Pat Hearn Gallery, New York (1989); and That’s All Folks!, Galerie GP & N Vallois, Paris (2021).

This series was first exhibited in the 1959 solo show Celebration of the Ground at the distinctive Galerie Daniel Cordier in Paris. Years later, in 1978, these works, some of which are featured in our exhibition, were included in The Early Years 1943 to 1959: An Exhibition of Paintings by Jean Dubuffet at Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York City.Dubuffet’s Materiologies and Texturologies series’ showcase the seemingly endless textures, shapes, and colors of the ground and earth’s soil from a bird's-eye perspective, showcasing the artist’s interest in exploring unorthodox materials and subjects, and approaching art from an authentic, humanistic angle while rejecting traditional notions of academic art.In the preface within the catalogue of the 1959 solo exhibition at Galerie Daniel Cordier, Dubuffet wrote:Observe that my predilection does not go to picturesque, luxuriously grooved or historic soils, as there are, those which are exceptional and to which for this reason attention is focused; oh not at all! I don't have a taste for exceptional things; In all areas it is the most common and the most banal that suits me best. Never anything exceptional in my work. Anything exceptional is strictly banned from my registry! It’s banality that I crave. The road most devoid of any accident or any particularity, any dirty floor or dusty bare earth, to which no one would have the idea of looking - deliberately at least - (even less painting them) - are for me layers of intoxication and jubilation.Jean Dubuffet’s works create a dialogue with Allan McCollum’s Perpetual Photo series, which began in 1972 when the artist started photographing television screens any time a framed picture appeared in the background. After McCollum began isolating, enlarging, and framing the photographs, the finished products turned into entirely new images whose subjects became undefinable. McCollum completed these works by adhering photos of the original tv screens to the backs of their counterparts, a defining allusion to the image’s context. McCollum’s inspiration to create the Perpetual Photo series is rooted in exposing humankind’s incessant need to discern any image that appears in front of them, and embraces his skill in institutional critique through creating artworks that analyze mass production and media.The dichotomy between the object and the image of the object is embedded in both Dubuffet and McCollum’s practices and beliefs. Both artists place great significance on the contradictions between mass produced objects and art, and despite their entirely different methods and time periods, Jean Dubuffet and Allan McCollum blur the boundaries between industrial, artisanal, and artistic production, offering viewers a new perception of art.This exhibition will be accompanied by an illustrated publication, with an essay on Jean Dubuffet and Allan McCollum by curator and former Director of Musée national d’art moderne-Centre Pompidou, Bernard Blistène.Jean Dubuffet (Le Havre, France, 1901-1985) is considered to be one of the most pivotal painters and sculptors from the Post-War period. As a firm advocate of outsider art, his own approach was highly experimental, rejecting traditional notions of artistic creation. Dubuffet’s work has been featured in major exhibitions at institutions including the Museum of Modern Art and Art Institute of Chicago (1962); Tate Gallery and Stedelijk Museum (1966); and Guggenheim Museum (1966–67). His works can be found in public collections such as the Centre Pompidou, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, among others. Dubuffet’s sculptures are installed in public spaces around the world, including Paris, New York, and Chicago.Allan McCollum (Los Angeles, California, b. 1944) is an American artist based in New York City. With a focus on mass consumption, his work has explored the layers of meaning within this phenomenon. McCollum has had major solo exhibitions at the Denver Art Museum (1990); Musée d'art moderne de Lille Métropole, France (1998); and Musée d'art moderne et contemporain, Geneva (2006) and his work was included in Aperto at the 1988 Venice Biennale and in the São Paulo Biennial (2008).

For sixty minutes, eleven performers — mainly dancers and movement artists with older bodies, including the artist — abstract the action that takes place on the field. The plot of SECONDARY revolves around the memory of an accident that occurred during a professional football game on August 12, 1978, where Jack Tatum, a defensive back for the Oakland Raiders, delivered an open field hit on Darryl Stingley, a wide receiver for the New England Patriots. Stingley was left paralyzed. Rebroadcast over and over in the sports media, this tragic event would remain seared in the minds of American fans and the young Barney, himself a youth league quarterback at the time.This new work demonstrates the complex superposition of real violence and its representation, as well as celebration, through sport and contemporary American society. It examines the game and affiliated culture through a unique movement vocabulary developed collaboratively with the cast of performers, movement director David Thomson, and Barney. The result is a highly physical, bodily study that focuses on every element of the game, from drills to pre-game rituals to moments of impact and their famous slow-motion replays.The SECONDARY exhibition will take place throughout all of the Fondation Cartier’s galleries, and will show for the first time a new sculpture created for the occasion. In addition, the exhibition will include an installation of the earliest Drawing Restraint video works, providing further context for the new work. The exhibition at the Fondation Cartier is part of a tour of unique SECONDARY shows scheduled for 2024 at the artist’s representing galleries.Born in San Francisco, California and raised in Boise, Idaho, Matthew Barney today lives and works in New York. A multifaceted artist, his practice incorporates film, performance, sculpture, photography, and drawing. He is famous for his feature works The CREMASTER Cycle (1994-2002), River of Fundament (2014), and Redoubt (2019), as well as his video series Drawing Restraint (1987-ongoing). As a sculptor, Barney works with materials ranging from petroleum jelly, bronze, contemporary polymers, and now for the first time terracotta, to create objects and installations intrinsically linked to his cinematic universe.Matthew Barney has presented large-scale projects in solo exhibitions at the Fondation Cartier pour l’art contemporain (1995); Guggenheim, New York (2002); 21st Century Museum for Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan (2005); Schaulager, Basel, Switzerland (2010 and 2021); the Morgan Library and Museum, New York (2013); Haus der Kunst, Munich, Germany (2014); and Yale University Art Gallery (2019). He received the Aperto Prize at the Venice Biennale (1993); the Hugo Boss Prize (1996); the Kaiser Ring Award in Goslar, Germany (2007); and the Golden Gate Persistence of Vision Award at the 54th San Francisco Film Festival (2011).",Matthew Barney: SECONDARY,"261 Boulevard Raspail, 75014",Tue-Sun 10am-8pm, 8 Jun  - 8 Sep 2024

Ceramicists began celebrating the simplicity and sincerity of their medium following the tenets of the Art Nouveau and Art Deco movements sweeping Europe. The same visual language can also be seen in Simonsson's new works.Arriving in Galerie Forsblom’s main exhibition space is like stepping into a sculpture gallery of yesteryear. The colossal centerpiece is the imposing Waking Dream sculpture. Scale is a theme that has preoccupied Simonsson for some years now, and his latest pieces are striking in their vast variations in size. By playing with different scales, Simonsson poses the question: how do dimensions affect the essence of the sculpture? The larger-than-life-size adds special resonance to his giant sculptures of children’s building blocks. Simonsson created the oversized blocks during the pandemic when he spent extended periods at home looking after his young twins, prompting him to wonder: who ultimately parents and raises us? Oversized dimensions similarly dialed up the impact of Simonsson’s signature Moss People presented at France's 2022 Lille3000 Utopia Festival.

She paints subjects as seemingly nondescript as clothing piled on a chair or a tea bag sagging on the edge of the kitchen sink. How can something so apparently trivial be transformed into something so spellbinding on canvas?Suikkanen takes inspiration from slow-paced films and books in which the storyline seems to move nowhere. Through her paintings, she strives to capture the lingering inertia of arrested moments that verge upon tedium. Suikkanen describes her method as being partly intuitive. Sometimes, a nuanced color might inspire her to replicate exactly the same shade on canvas. Occasionally, she might stumble upon a suitable theme after an unremarkable daily occurrence – a forgettable experience such as trying on a shirt that has grown too tight is a mundane incident, but one that imparts a tragicomic narrative that lends itself consummately to a painting. Suikkanen records her observations as cellphone photos and text snippets, which she jots down whenever she notices anything of interest. She then harnesses these random observations in the studio as raw material in her painting process.Suikkanen’s recent work has grown progressively more stripped-down and minimalistic both in subject matter and style. In her latest paintings, she pays growing attention to polishing her compositions and perfecting her subtle treatment of color. The process often presents a challenge that spurs the artist to delve into a certain theme. How can the paintbrush be employed to create an illusion of fluffy softness like the texture of a knitted woolly hood? And how can different shades be combined so that the color planes leap to life upon our retinas?Saimi Suikkanen (b.1994) graduated with a master’s degree in fine arts from Helsinki’s Academy of Fine Arts (in 2022) and a degree in painting from the Saimaa University of Applied Sciences in 2017.

For Wuorila-Stenberg, painting is a form of meditation and a quest for peace. Meditation has played a very important role in the artist’s life for over forty years, and so it is only natural that his creative process flows from a similar all-encompassing, meditative state of emptying one’s mind. His paintings' psychological and spiritual content seems to transcend what can be expressed in words. It is important for Wuorila-Stenberg that each painting has a fundamentally ineffable core. How can something for which there are no words be verbalized? Language fails as we confront a pristine rush of emotions that shakes us to our core.Wuorila-Stenberg’s expressionistic style is influenced by the years he spent studying art in West Berlin during the 1970s. His expressionism finds a counterpart in his paintings' equally striking surrealist elements. Themes and events related to the artist’s own life are his primary source of inspiration, and his chosen colors are also linked to personal experiences. The artist in fact describes his relationship with color as an intensely psychological one. His raw choreographies of color impart their very own narratives, and their evocative textures endow color with a powerful material presence in his paintings.Wuorila-Stenberg’s process is totally intuitive: when he picks up the paintbrush, he has no idea where the journey will lead. The crucial thing is that he achieves a state of flow, and the stages and traces of the process must be visible on the canvas. Thumbing his nose at convention, Wuorila-Stenberg has always regarded painting as a vehicle of self-expression and identity-building. He describes painting as having grown easier with age; in his youth, he felt a greater need to define his place within the context of art history, but these days, he allows the process to flow freely, unfettered by labels and definitions.Henry Wuorila-Stenberg (b. 1949) ranks among Finland’s most acclaimed painters. This year marks his 50th artist anniversary. Wuorila-Stenberg has received numerous accolades, including the Pro Finlandia medal in 2004 and the Finland Award in 1996. His work is represented in the collections of the Gothenburg Museum of Art, EMMA Espoo Museum of Modern Art, HAM Helsinki Art Museum, the Wäinö Aaltonen Museum, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma.

She liberates the medium from its traditional places, creating interconnected bodies of work replete with both poetic and narrative possibilities. To create these, Singh draws on her extensive and ongoing pictorial archive that is constantly in motion and continuously refined. This show explores in part the intersection of photography and architecture, it includes a major series of wall-based pieces as well as a structural installation.The exhibition opens with a pair of large photographs of flowers. These evocative monochrome works have a decidedly sensuous presence. The delicate, semi-translucent petals of one seem to create an effect akin to a photographic negative, whilst the other appears to be in a somewhat disheveled state, likened by Singh to someone who has just tumbled out of bed.Occupying the other walls are a new series of ‘contact sheets’ which demonstrate the artist’s singular relationship with architecture. Constructed from rows of framed photographs, each work allows for the arrangement and rearrangement of individual images. This near-limitless possibility for new compositions and constructed histories reveals Singh’s ability to observe and capture what lies beyond the simple geometrical formation of a space. Years of practice have honed her ability to identify an archetypal essence of space, independent of scale, time or style. The images themselves are diverse, ranging from the ancient rock cut caves of 7th century Ellora in Maharashtra State or Le Corbusier’s Ronchamp Chapel to the contemporary Indian architecture of Rahul Mehrotra and the artist’s own architectural structures installed in museum spaces. They communicate Singh’s very subjective view of the history of architecture along with an intuitive feeling for light and how it falls upon surfaces and affects interior spaces. Here light itself is the common space in which all the images exist, allowing them to enter the realm of abstraction. Horizontal and vertical lines become tools through which to merge the real and potential, no longer defining where one ends and another begins.The gallery floor space is occupied by a large teak structure which references Singh’s freestanding museums that act as both means of display as well as storage for her photographs. But this particular work, which contains no images, is not quite sculpture nor architecture despite alluding to both. The installation has a distinctly domestic aspect, it contains a bed, a desk and seating, as such it proposes another way to live, a highly aesthetic and perhaps ascetic dwelling place.Dayanita Singh was born in New Delhi, India in 1961 where she lives and works. She studied Visual Communication at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad and Photojournalism and Documentary Photography at the International Center of Photography in New York.

Begun in 1971, the Good Paintings are differentiated from Jenney’s previous body of work, which he designated as Bad Paintings (1969–70) after curator Marcia Tucker’s 1978 New Museum exhibition “Bad” Painting, which included his work. Painted in acrylic in a loose, gestural style, the Bad Paintings represent relationships between people and things, while upending preconceptions of connoisseurship and “good taste.” The Good Paintings are instead exacting studies of nature in oil paint on wooden panels.Jenney’s Good Paintings impart the experience of observing the North American landscape at close range, in contrast with the expansive vistas of untamed wilderness typical of the historical Hudson River School. While describing the natural world, many of the works also remind us that the environment is never far removed from human intervention. Jenney’s handmade black wooden frames are integral to these works, which he regards as “painted sculpture.” Playing off the classical conception of a painting as a window into fictive space, the frames create an architectural foreground, asserting their status as physical objects. The works’ mediated nature is further emphasized by the inclusion of titles stenciled in uppercase serif lettering.In the Good Paintings, “good” is both a formal and a conceptual label as seen through Jenney’s refined use of paint and color, and his approach to themes of universal significance, such as the artist’s cultural role, climate change, and notions of societal progress. Depicting a sky without a horizon, Atmosphere (1985) emphasizes diffuse, glowing sunlight. Stretching over twelve and a half feet wide in a narrow horizontal format, North America Divided (1992–99) pictures a tree stump and bands of cirrus clouds together with a worn wooden fence, strands of barbed wire, and the remains of wires and porcelain insulators indicating that it was once electrified. Related paintings feature divisions within the landscape, with fence posts, paths, stone walls, and other constructions demarcating space.North American Aquatica (2006–07) renders a body of water in turbulent brushstrokes of deep blue and white, inspired by Baltic currents. North American Summer (2019–20) presents the forms of a maple tree’s leaves and branches against a background of mottled brushstrokes in brown and bright green that suggest a manicured lawn, the composition’s striking vantage point establishing contrast between its natural and artificial aspects. With a sense of subjectivity that verges on the mythological, the Good Paintings convey the coexistence of their subjects in both the real and the imagined world.",Neil Jenney: Idealism Is Unavoidable,"541 West 24th Street, NY 10011",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 2 May  - 22 Jun 2024

The medium underpins the evolution of the artist’s paintings and is a key component of his books. Punctum offers new perspectives on his exploration of materials and processes, and on the symbolic and expressive potentials of photography.The exhibition’s title refers to a concept formulated by Roland Barthes in his critical text Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography (1980). Punctum (Latin for “puncture” or “wound”) connotes a detail of a photograph that elicits a feeling or personal impact outside those formed principally by its culturally coded subjects. As if picturing a memory of something that never happened, Kiefer’s photographs convey a comprehensive, evocative, even melancholic aura beyond conventional representations of time and place.Returning to perennial motifs and images, the photographs reinforce the continuity of themes such as ruin and destruction, and growth and renewal, across Kiefer’s oeuvre, with subjects ranging from sunflowers and snow-covered fields to dense cityscapes of São Paulo. Works titled Merkaba (2010–13 and 2010–15) and Jericho (2010–15) picture the tower sculptures at La Ribaute, his former studio complex in Barjac, France—now part of his foundation, Eschaton.Kiefer often manipulates his photographs through techniques such as solarization and the application of metals and other materials that transform them physically and metaphorically. In Osiris (1985–91), the addition of heavy, opaque lead to the photograph’s top half creates a juxtaposition between its material properties and its ethereal image, functioning as an effective metaphor for alchemy. Likewise, by applying silver toner to the printed surfaces of works such as Feldblumen (Wildflowers) and Ukraine (both 1994–2012), he blurs distinctions between the photographic and painted image.Titled with a quotation from Immanuel Kant, Der gestirnte Himmel über uns und das moralische Gesetz in uns (The moral law within us, the starry heavens above us) (1969–2009) revisits an image from Kiefer’s Besetzungen (Occupations) series, a parodic travelogue in which the artist poses with a sieg heil salute at culturally charged European locations, appropriating and recontextualizing the taboo gesture to confront the historical weight of the Second World War. In the newer work, Kiefer overpaints the photograph’s top half in gouache, adding a star-filled sky that resonates with Kant’s line.Hero und Leander (2012) is a vitrine sculpture that expresses Kiefer’s relationship with photography. It incorporates a metal bathtub of the sort he used to develop his first photographs and included in early performances, with coiled strips of photographic prints mounted on lead that unfurl from within the vessel. Its title alludes to the Greek legend of Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite who tends a lighthouse on one side of the Hellespont between Europe and Asia, and her lover, Leander, who drowns while swimming across the strait when the guiding light of Hero’s flame is extinguished.Punctum follows La photographie au commencement (Photography at the Beginning), the first retrospective to focus on Kiefer’s relationship with photography, which was organized by the Lille Métropole Musée d’art moderne, d’art contemporain et d’art brut (LaM) in Villeneuve-d’Ascq, France (2023–24).

Each of his canvases is structured as a loose grid of rectilinear blocks in three or four rows. Laying down one vivid color at a time, the artist establishes relationships between each area, its neighbors, and the composition as a whole, employing gestural brushwork to juxtapose hues applied with varied degrees of opacity. Between each row are linear bands that ground the composition and sometimes extend the tones of individual blocks. Inspired by jazz, Whitney defines a space within which to improvise, each painting setting a unique group of chromatic and spatial harmonies in motion.Peaches (2023) is dominated by the warm pinks and oranges suggested by its title, which stand in contrast to the cooler blues, blacks, and greens with which they are paired. Spanning ten feet in width, As Wild as the World 2 (2023) reveals the visual impact of scale in conjunction with Whitney’s iterative technique. High Hopes (2024) is a study in contrasts, with complementary pairs of red/green and orange/blue pressing against one another. The loose brushstrokes and more muted tones at the top and bottom of A Tribute to Billie (2024) establish a sonorous composition that evokes the expressive power and vulnerability of its namesake, Billie Holiday.With an unwavering commitment to abstraction, Whitney uses titles that resonate with his inspirations: art and architecture, poetry and music, contemporary issues and observations. On the title of this exhibition, he notes: “I first read this line in a poem in Rome in 1994 and used it as the title of a painting that year. The line stayed with me, and I ended up using it for the title of another painting in 2004. Now, thirty years later, those words seem to resonate with the time we’re living in more than ever.”By the Love of Those Unloved coincides with How High the Moon at the Buffalo AKG Art Museum, the first retrospective to trace the evolution of Whitney’s abstractions over forty-five years. On view in Buffalo, New York, through May 26, 2024, the exhibition will travel to the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (2024–25), and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2025).

Gagosian Beverly Hills,Beverly Hills,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/jean-michel-basquiat-made-on-market-street/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Jean-Michel Basquiat,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/jean-michel-basquiat/,"Between November 1982 and May 1984, Basquiat produced approximately a hundred paintings, numerous works on paper, and six silkscreen editions in Venice, California. For an artist closely affiliated with the New York art scene of the 1980s, Basquiat was extraordinarily prolific in Los Angeles. Made on Market Street reflects on this pivotal era by bringing together nearly thirty works— several of which are among his most important paintings. Larry Gagosian notes, “Los Angeles has always been a great city for artists and Jean-Michel seemed to find it a refreshing change from New York. While the immensity of his talent was immediately apparent, it was nonetheless a highlight of my own career to work with him, to introduce him to Los Angeles, and to witness the amazing impact that his art and legacy have made on our culture.”After first meeting Basquiat in 1981, Gagosian invited him to Los Angeles. Basquiat’s solo exhibition with Larry Gagosian Gallery in LA—the first time his work was presented on the West Coast—opened in April 1982, immediately following his first solo show in New York at Annina Nosei’s gallery. The Los Angeles exhibition was seen as the arrival of a significant voice by the public and collectors alike. In November 1982 Basquiat returned to California, living and working at Gagosian’s residence on Market Street, a three-story structure with an interior courtyard open to the light and air from the beach nearby.That same year, Basquiat met Fred Hoffman, who was running New City Editions, and together they would produce six editioned prints, including Tuxedo and Untitled (both 1983), large-scale silkscreen works on canvas. Featuring white text, sketches, and directional arrows on a black ground, Tuxedo contrasts with Basquiat’s intensely colorful paintings of the era, its dense collection of allusive phrases ascending to the crown at its top.For Basquiat, working in Venice offered a reprieve from the distractions and pressures of the New York art scene. Many of the paintings he produced in Venice were shown at his next Los Angeles exhibition, which opened on March 8, 1983, at Larry Gagosian Gallery and presented approximately thirty paintings, including Hollywood Africans, Horn Players, Museum Security (Hollywood Meltdown), Luna Park, Untitled, and Year of the Boar (all 1983). Made on Market Street will present many of these pivotal works together again for the first time.A highlight of the exhibition is Hollywood Africans, a work that portrays Basquiat alongside fellow artists Toxic and Rammellzee as new Black celebrities in a palette that evokes the bright Southern California sun. Fusing drawing, painting, and text across three panels, Horn Players pays homage to jazz greats Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. Underscoring the importance of music to Basquiat, it conveys the vitality of bebop in a visual style informed by contemporary graffiti and hip-hop. The same year it was painted, Basquiat would produce the influential hip-hop track “Beat Bop” on his own Tartown Record label, featuring Rammellzee and K-Rob.In the summer of 1983, Basquiat was drawn back to Los Angeles. He returned to Market Street, this time establishing his own studio a few doors down and remaining there until late in the spring of 1984. One night, while Basquiat was working, he went outside to a fenced-in courtyard just behind the studio, where he encountered an unhoused person sleeping. After this incident the courtyard’s fence was removed, but instead of disposing of the wooden slats Basquiat integrated them as supports for some of his most iconic paintings—Flexible, Gold Griot, and M (all 1984), all of which will be exhibited as a group in Made on Market Street for the first time since they were created. With Flexible, Basquiat expanded his portrayal of the Black male, presenting a larger-than-life figure whose elastic, expressive arm gesture combines the artist’s interests in anatomy, symbolism, and qualities he characterized as “royalty, heroism, and the streets.”Made on Market Street is accompanied by a catalogue that reproduces the exhibited works together with archival material, including installation images from the 1982 and 1983 exhibitions at Larry Gagosian Gallery, historical ephemera, and exhibition reviews, as well as previously unpublished photographs of Basquiat in his studio. A conversation between Larry Gagosian, Fred Hoffman, filmmaker Tamra Davis, and the artist’s sisters, Lisane Basquiat and Jeanine Heriveaux, will be featured, along with an essay where Hoffman reflects on the works that Basquiat produced in Los Angeles, discussing the complex symbolism and restless innovation that permeated his oeuvre.Larry Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles presented three exhibitions with Basquiat during the artist’s lifetime: Jean-Michel Basquiat: Paintings at 619 North Almont Drive, April 8–May 8, 1982; Jean-Michel Basquiat: New Paintings at 510 North Robertson Boulevard, March 8–April 2, 1983; and Jean-Michel Basquiat at 510 North Robertson Boulevard, January 7–February 8, 1986.

From the modernist preoccupation with the fragmented or disintegrated body typical of Picasso’s and Giacometti’s work to the postmodern expansion of sculpture into a range of environmental and anti-monumental forms exemplified by Nauman’s, this is the first exhibition to juxtapose sculptures by these three artists. It features classic pieces by all three, including Picasso’s La femme enceinte I (1950) and Bras vertical (1961), Giacometti’s La jambe (1958) and Grande tête (1960), and Nauman’s Henry Moore Bound to Fail (1967–70) and Model for Room with My Soul Left Out, Room That Does Not Care (1984).A pioneer of Cubism best known for his paintings, drawings, and collages, Picasso produced numerous sculptures, which are among his most experimental works. He primarily sculpted in two distinct modes: modeling clay or plaster for casting into bronze, and constructing or assembling forms from discarded objects and cheap materials such as sheet metal, wood, and cardboard. In works of astonishing wit and originality, not to mention erotic suggestiveness, Picasso investigated means of manipulating mass and surface to incorporate multiple perspectives into a single head, limb, or figure.In Paris in the 1920s Giacometti came under the influence of Surrealism, encouraging him to incorporate into his sculptures a sense of sexual violence or threat that Nauman would later take up. Giacometti’s modeled and cast sculptures from the postwar period—fragile, highly textured, and strikingly elongated—broke away from the conventions of classical sculpture to evoke instead the survivors of some human or natural catastrophe. These depictions of the fractured and vulnerable figure or of isolated body parts appear frozen in motion, prompting reflections on mortality. Focusing almost exclusively on the body, Giacometti’s paring of the figure to its bare essentials challenged tradition and paved the way for contemporary artists to consider new possibilities.Since the 1960s Nauman has pursued a varied practice that builds on Picasso’s and Giacometti’s innovations. Nauman produces work in sculpture, performance, video, and neon that confronts viewers with their own physical limitations and employs repetitive actions, linguistic play, and stark imagery to disrupt perception and thought. The artist’s invocation of corporeal presence echoes Giacometti’s, yet he visualizes the human condition through the prisms of contemporary culture and modern technology. Addressing concerns such as the effect of surveillance and the allure of instant gratification, Nauman’s works require the viewer’s physical presence and mental engagement to activate them.Giacometti, Nauman, and Picasso have all redefined sculpture—reshaping traditional mediums and pioneering new ones. Picasso’s groundbreaking move away from a naturalistic representation of the human form was extended by Giacometti, whose elongated, modeled, and cast figures draw attention to material and process, while evoking the artist’s struggle to capture a living, breathing presence in three dimensions. Nauman often uses his own body as subject, and encourages the viewer to become an involved participant. For all three artists, the space we occupy, the ways we are perceived, and our effect on others are crucial elements in their unique methods of existential inquiry.Header: Left: Alberto Giacometti working in his studio, Paris, 1956.

Over the course of four decades, he continually reinvented his practice, moving from his intimate drawings of the 1950s to iconic silkscreened Pop paintings of celebrities, consumer goods, and disasters in the 1960s; portraits of the social elite in the 1970s; and photographs, television shows, and collaborative projects in the 1980s. This heterogeneity has seen Warhol’s legacy inform and inspire numerous contemporary artists.Warhol’s paintings Silver Liz [Studio Type] (1963), Mao (1973), and Marilyn Monroe (1979), and his Screen Test film of Donyale Luna (1965–66), redefined portraiture in relation to contemporary style, power, and celebrity. In addition, Brillo Box (1964) and Dollar Sign (1981) brought commercial design and financial icons into the realm of fine art, while his Flowers (1964) and Shadows series (1978–79) introduced new modes of abstraction.The new styles of representation that Warhol developed and his challenging of gender norms both resonate with the thematic centrality of identity, glamour, and performance to photographs by Nan Goldin, which here include Ivy in opera gloves, Boston (1972). Jean-Michel Basquiat’s double portrait of himself with Warhol, Dos Cabezas (1982), was made shortly after Basquiat first met his idol, while Sweet Pungent (1984–85) is one of more than 160 paintings on which the pair collaborated—it also saw Warhol return to painting by hand.As often as Warhol experimented with new art-making strategies, he also reimagined his public persona through techniques of doubling, masking, and recording. In his Polaroid Self-Portrait in Fright Wig (1986), he alters his appearance by donning silver wig and sunglasses, also obscuring his features in shadow. Foregrounding an uneasy affinity with this approach, Douglas Gordon’s Self-Portrait of You +Me (2 piece) Andy (2008) comprises a commercial reproduction of a self-portrait of a bewigged Warhol that is partially burned, split, and mounted to a mirrored background. Dew (2023) by Urs Fischer employs post-Warholian strategies of appropriation and transformation of commercial imagery, while in The Athlete (2024), Nathaniel Mary Quinn interprets Polaroids and paintings of Muhammad Ali and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar from Warhol’s Athletes series, along with a Campbell’s soup can.Zeng Fanzhi’s double portrait of himself and Warhol in Fly (2000) imagines the two artists—their features hidden behind identical masks—standing in a field of flowers, as two jets fly overhead. A new painting by Takashi Murakami resonates with Warhol’s Flowers by abstracting from nature to create an instantly recognizable form, while Sky (2012) by Alex Israel recalls the Pop artist’s embrace of artificiality. Cool Down Bench (RWB) (2023) by Derrick Adams embraces popular culture, Untitled (2010) by Richard Prince employs a humor conversant with Warhol’s, and Sterling Ruby’s BC (4833) (2014) is inspired in part by Warhol’s Rorschach paintings. Through these works, Andy Warhol’s Long Shadow brings to light unexpected juxtapositions with artists whose work “thinks” through, with, and beyond Warhol’s oeuvre, demonstrating its enduring relevance.",Andy Warhol’s Long Shadow,"7/F Pedder Building, 12 Pedder Street, Central",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 25 Mar  - 22 Jun 2024

The artist’s first solo exhibition in Japan and his largest ever in Asia, Afro-Mingei centers on the cultural hybridity that informs Gates’s work, combining Black diasporic culture with Japanese craft traditions. Together, the exhibitions in France and Japan present interrelated aspects of his wide-ranging oeuvre, bridging both the works’ individual significance and the modes of public address that are fundamental to his practice.Made with roofing material of bitumen-infused polyester mats known as torch down, these complex, collage-like compositions of layered and juxtaposed color bear the marks of flame and tar used to bind them together. These transformative processes are charged with significance both as vital infrastructure that usually goes unnoticed and as the artist’s familial legacy. Included in the exhibition at Le Bourget is the tar kettle that he inherited from his late father, a professional roofer. For Gates, working with tar is a means to produce art that engages with modernist abstraction as well as modes of craft and labor, while serving to commemorate his father.For the first time, Gates incorporates words into his tar paintings, using large stencils to apply them and competing with the scale of billboards. “1-800 ROOFING” is a slogan that advertises a fictive company, reinforcing the artist’s conception of art as a collective endeavor. In addition, he incorporates silkscreened imagery from the archives of the Johnson Publishing Company, the Chicago-based publisher of Ebony and Jet magazines, which Gates has preserved in their entirety through his Rebuild Foundation. The silkscreened image of a singer signifies the central role of Black music and musicians in defining American culture.",Theaster Gates: Black Mystic,"26 avenue de l’Europe, 93350",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 13 Apr  - 23 Jul 2024  
Gagosian Open,London,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/nan-goldin-sisters-saints-sibyls/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Gagosian-Open.jpg,Nan Goldin,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/nan-goldin/,"Goldin begins her film Sisters, Saints, Sibyls (2004–22) with the myth of Saint Barbara, presenting the story of the early Christian martyr as a three-channel projection that echoes the triptych format of classical religious painting. Images of Saint Barbara accompany a voiceover that describes her defiance of her parents’ beliefs, a transgression for which they tortured her. This is analogous to the real subject of Goldin’s film and underpins its visual narrative.In 1958, Goldin’s elder sister, Barbara Holly Goldin, was sent to a psychiatric detention center at age twelve. She spent time in and out of such facilities for the next six years. Barbara was accused of “acting out, open defiance, sexually provocative behavior, association with undesirable friends, [and being] loud and coarse in speech.” Reports state that she went on dates with an older Black man, appeared to be confused about her sexual identity, and refused to shave her legs. Barbara stirred up a perfect storm of middle-class, midcentury fears around race, sexuality, and gender roles.Goldin was a witness to the physical and psychic abuse that Barbara suffered and that her family tried to conceal. Barbara’s death by suicide in 1965, at the age of eighteen, was a defining event in Goldin’s life, prompting her to rebel against and run away from her living situation at the time, and the remainder of Sisters, Saints, Sibyls describes how she found her tribe of fellow rebels. She shows us her own experience with addiction, confinement, and self-harm, and that with living comes not only maturity and change, but also loss and pain.For the site of the Gagosian Open presentation of Sisters, Saints, Sibyls, Goldin chose a deconsecrated church in Soho known as the Welsh chapel. The installation is a visceral, immersive environment, referencing nineteenth-century operating theaters. The piece was originally conceived in 2004, for the chapel of the Hôpital de la Salpêtrière, Paris. Salpêtrière was founded as an asylum in 1656 and was where Jean-Martin Charcot practiced his experiments on “hysteric” women. Goldin’s life’s work has always been about fighting stigma embedded in our society, addressing issues that include mental illness, addiction, and sexuality.This Will Not End Well is a retrospective focused on Goldin’s moving-image work, recently on view at Moderna Museet, Stockholm (2022–23), and Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2023–24), and traveling to the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin; Pirelli HangarBicocca, Milan; and Grand Palais, Paris, over the next two years.This fall, Gagosian will present an exhibition of Goldin’s work in New York.Nan Goldin was born in Washington, DC, in 1953. She lives and works in New York, Berlin, and Paris. Her work is represented in major public and private collections worldwide. Retrospectives include I’ll Be Your Mirror, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1996–97, traveled to Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Germany, 1997; Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, 1997; Fotomuseum Winterthur, Switzerland, 1997; Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna, 1998; and Národní galerie Praha, Prague, 1998); and Le Feu Follet, Centre Pompidou, Paris (2001, traveled as Devil’s Playground to Whitechapel Gallery, London, 2002; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, 2002; Fundação Serralves, Porto, Portugal, 2002; Castello di Rivoli Museo d’Arte Contemporanea, Turin, Italy, 2002–03; and Ujazdowski Castle Centre for Contemporary Art, Warsaw, 2003). Goldin was appointed Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres by the Republic of France (2006), and is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Hasselblad Award (2007), Edward MacDowell Medal (2012), Centenary Medal from London’s Royal Photographic Society (2018), and Käthe Kollwitz Prize (2022).","Nan Goldin: Sisters, Saints, Sibyls","83 Charing Cross Road, WC2H 0AA",Tue-Sun 10am-6pm, 30 May  - 23 Jun 2024  
Gagosian Rome,Rome,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/oscar-murillo-marks-and-whispers/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Oscar Murillo,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/oscar-murillo/,"Murillo is known for expansive canvases, constructed from stitched-together elements, which incorporate elements of gesture, text, and studio detritus. He also produces books, drawings, sculptural installations, and videos that deconstruct and map flows of populations, power, and resources in currents of globalization and cultural exchange. Through each strand of his practice, Murillo probes ideas of collectivity and shared culture, and demonstrates a commitment to the power of material presence.Each work in Marks and Whispers stands as a marker, suggesting fragility, despair, vulnerability, and precariousness. Hung on freestanding walls, the paintings activate the gallery’s ovoid rotunda with complex sight lines, their surfaces layered with arresting hues of scarlet that hint at the anguish which underlies a world of privilege. Such references reflect Murillo’s interrogative process of painting, which frequently involves the dense and intuitive layering of paint and the subsequent scarring of the canvas. In Marks and Whispers, this intense transfer of energy is foregrounded, as one work leads to another.The exhibition begins with paintings from Catalyst, an ongoing series that Murillo began as a student in 2011. Each of these works is produced by saturating a skein of canvas with pigment, then laying a second canvas on top and using a long stylus to transfer marks from one surface to the other in an explosive full-body process. The first painted sheet is then used multiple times to make new works, each one infused with the energy of drawing.Works from the Manifestation series (2018–) build on this technique, as dense gestural marks and thick impasto are layered atop stitched-together fragments of canvas. Their surfaces embody the physicality of the act of painting, a palpable “manifestation”; imposing in scale, they are energized by the conviction and urgency of dissenting action. The compositions on view are thus materially interconnected, culminating in entries from Scarred Spirits, Murillo’s most recent series, presented here for the first time. A meditation on automatic and large-scale drawing, they contain a history of his studio practice and represent an evolution in his process.Murillo’s interrogation of mark making continues in his Flight drawings, which incorporate repeated ink marks, letters, words, and numbers drawn by the artist while traveling across the globe. These works are characterized by a simplicity of means, their maker taking advantage of travel’s meditative lull to experiment with the possibilities of improvisation with a restricted range of tools. Through their visual detachment from territory, the drawings question the geographical and discursive marks that carve out patterns of nationhood and migration, reconfiguring our understanding of the globe.From July 20 to August 26, Murillo will present a newly commissioned installation, The Flooded Garden, at Tate Modern, London, as part of the UNIQLO Tate Play program. Concurrent to the Rome exhibition, Murillo’s work is the subject of exhibitions at the Museu Serralves, Porto, Portugal; WIELS Contemporary Art Centre, Brussels; and Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna.",Oscar Murillo: Marks and Whispers,"Via Francesco Crispi 16, 00187",Tue-Sat 10.30am-7pm, 12 Apr  - 15 Jun 2024

Even before the lockdown began, Smith had been living in isolation for years, rarely leaving the house and avoiding interviews as he focused on paintings for a major exhibition in New York.Since the pandemic, Smith has emerged transformed as a new public persona. On Instagram, his presence suggests that he is an art-world ambassador, and on YouTube, he hosts an ongoing lo-fi series called Studio News, in which he discusses his artistic pursuits and sometimes nothing at all. It is ‘straight man’ comedy, sprinkled with revelations about his inner life, all mixed up. It is the kind of unblinking deadpan that often looks back at you from Smith’s paintings: a sincere satire.On the occasion of his new show Studio News at Galerie Eva Presenhuber in Vienna, Smith reached out Simonini and asked to do a second interview to follow up on their initial conversation and respond to its heavy, introspective tone.Ross Simonini Did you want to do a revised interview because your personality has changed since our first talk?Josh Smith Yes, I was in a dark place at that time, but not so much anymore.RS I feel like I can see that with your new use of Instagram and YouTube.JS It’s all been positive. I’ve met a lot of people, exposed myself to new opportunities, and have been able to play around with how people see me.RS Would you say that you post things for other people or yourself?JS Well both. It’s for anyone. I like archiving little things. I like the way the grid looks. How the platforms preserve the content. Often times I post things that I know people won’t particularly like. People want art but that’s not always what I can give. I want human stuff as well. I think of it all as an art project. It’s a new medium for me. It’s the same way I think about my paintings. I’m excited about YouTube now.RS You have a program called Studio News, which is sort of an ironic title.JS Because nothing happens in the studio.RS There is no news.JS Never.RS Do you enjoy being a public persona now?JS Fortunately, not too public. It makes me self-conscious but I like that feeling. Making art makes me feel self-conscious too.RS Showing or making?JS Making. In the studio I have anxiety about changing. I get turned off by the idea of doing the same thing over and over again. But it’s nerve wracking to change... You do that too, change what you make.RS I do. It’s tricky. People want you to stay the same, like a brand.JS If you want to change you have to lean into it. You have to hammer it hard. I don’t want to be an artist who makes the same thing over and over and this body of work illustrates another change.RS They feel new to me in many ways. Your images seem to dance across the canvas now. How do they feel new to you?JS I’m taking away the figure, ground relationship, the background and foreground. It’s all over. The stencils negate the expressionist qualities. I worked and hoped for this.RS But you are making the stencils.JS Yes, I cut them. I make them myself.RS Do you think about the word “pop”?JS Yes, sometimes. Most art is pop art now. It’s the kind of time we are in. Things are all on social media, which is pop. I want to make pop art, but I don’t want to do Warhol.RS The last show was all red paintings.JS Red is repulsive. It’s also alluring. During that time red was everywhere in my studio. And I left the stencils out of that show intentionally. It’s a power color, but I did it. Now I’m pushing against that. That’s what I do. Often, I am reacting against the past show or reacting to anything. This helps make my work feel alive.RS When did you make these paintings?JS I made these in the late fall, early winter... But I don’t understand what they mean.RS I’d never ask you that.JS I know you wouldn’t. I think they are somewhat self-portraits. They are collections of things around me. Collections. That could be a good title. That gives it value, or a way for them to connect.RS It’s like you’re building a vocabulary and then constructing sentences.JS It’s exactly that. That’s what I did. I used my vocabulary to make sentences.RS They’re simple, archetypal images. Most people have a relationship to these things.JS The ladder is something I painted in college because it’s neutral. And I love the eagle, the rope...all of it.RS Do you see this vocabulary as Halloween-y?RS My work does get Halloween-y sometimes. It’s what seems to happen. Maybe it is a search for an inner child. Not being such an adult about things.JS Do you plan your paintings?RS Not right now. A lot of times I don’t. I only want to paint. The stencils allow me to relish in that idea. When I would start these, I had the ingredients, but I didn’t know what I was making. This was a new way to work. I hope the viewer can clearly tell how the paintings were constructed.RS That seems generous, to allow people into the process. Do you think these paintings document the change in your personality?JS I hadn’t thought of it but the work is much more buoyant. It’s less heavy, especially compared to red paintings. Those felt menacing, toward me. These feel more open-ended. I try to make all my paintings open-ended. I come up with an idea and make it function. A lot of my ideas are terrible. Starting with a terrible idea is something that I find challenging. I appreciate the challenge. Maybe terrible is too harsh of a word, but I like working uphill.RS What percentage of your work makes it to exhibitions?JS It depends on what’s going on. On average, 50% of things that I start. I try different things out. I start in the dark and end in the light.RS Is it important that your paintings express how you feel?JS Yes. Ultimately, it’s about how honest I am with myself. For the most part, I am an expressionist. Whether I like it or not. But I don’t think many people will see the paintings like that. I hope people put their own feelings into a painting, rather than think of me.Ross Simonini is an artist, writer and composer living in Los Angeles.Josh Smith was born in 1976 in Okinawa, Japan (his father was in the military) and, after a number of relocations, grew up mostly in eastern Tennessee, US.

Soon thereafter, she left these rooms, conjuring instead exterior scenes of swamps and lakes, dense woodlands with strokes for leaves and clearings opening to patches of thunderous faraway skies. Some vistas were framed within a proscenium of branches or the aperture of a cresting wave—pictorial devices signaling the image as having been staged. Hughes has described these ongoing works from the last decade as kinds of imaginary landscapes, most literally in that they do not depict specific places. But this further suggests how Hughes appropriates the genre as a way to think about how one might arrange color and shape on a flat surface into something recognizable.Hughes’s paintings are about painting as much as about nature, of trees grown not in soil but sprouted, as if sui generis, from the sluice of underpainting. In Tree Farm, they flaunt their inventiveness, offering the comparative play of difference within a serial format: one tall tree per vertical canvas. Each painting seems to harbor its own light source, palette, and temperature, cultivating within these distinct atmospheres specimens that arc to the physical edges of supports as if heliotropic, crown their enclosures, or fall to the loam where undergrowth rises to meet the detumescent branches. Color is everywhere saturated and pitched to maximum expressive potential, if modulated according to its site. Wits End is a conflagration of reds and signal orange cut with ribbons of turquoise, lapis, and goldenrod; by contrast, Come and Get It is a nocturne of deep purples and red-brown hills, its gangly protagonist standing erect with so many boughs—evocative of limbs—ending in orbs that redouble the celestial flecks legible as stars.Hughes here coaxes ever more possibilities for compositional generation from her evolving lexicon. Prismatic, faceted planes, arcing lines spaced or tightly striated and ordered, clustering daubs and dots, and transitions between these and other modes of applying paint might be endlessly recombined without yielding the same effects. And in any given instance, Hughes near-magically slips between having the paint signify and be: marks stand for foliage or snow or rock even as they visibly remain marks. Look at any section and watch aspects disambiguate and reverse. Like the psychological tool of the bistable image (most famously in Joseph Jastrow’s representation of the duck that is also a rabbit, but not at the same time), Hughes’s paintings point to how visual experience is organized for the maker as much as for the viewer—and how the positionality of both is very literally determinant.The title, Tree Farm, refers to Hughes’s family’s pine tree farm in western Georgia, where she spent time as a child, amidst new growth that in time came to be large enough to fell and replant. Thus does it introduce not only the shifting perspective of passage through a prepared environment, marked by the volatility of light and weather, but also how fantasy and memory mediate the encounter. Here, Hughes is likewise exhibiting for the first time a group of tabletop ceramics. These small sculptures model arboreal varieties, knobby and slender, sprightly and manicured, their glazes crackling and lustrous by turn as befits the process of firing without controlling the outcome. The makeshift grove that results invites movement to see each piece from multiple vantages and to understand them in relation. As with the accompanying paintings, they continue Hughes’s use of the nominal subject of landscape as a heuristic for experiments in generating form.Accompanying the exhibition is a curated selection of paintings by the artist’s father, Joe Hughes, on view in a cabinet next to the main gallery.Suzanne HudsonShara Hughes was born in 1981 in Atlanta, GA, US, and lives and works in Brooklyn, NY, US.

Her pictorial cosmology, which is concerned with what it is possible to express, or to make visible, is in no way an off-the-ground phantasmagoria. Indeed, Lucie Picandet has chosen to root her work in the organic nature of the body, which links us to all living things. This organicity is beyond the grasp of language, but certainly not beyond the effects of speech, as psychoanalysis teaches us. How can we restore the reality deficit filtered through language, logic and discursive reason? By symbolically giving a voice to fictional, non-human entities such as parasites, radiolarians, bats, gorillas and octopuses, Lucie Picandet conjures up a relativistic space that could accommodate the multiplicity of worlds (...) Lucie Picandet's ambitious project to connect us to a ""bodily perception"" unfolds with humour, tenderness and fantasy.She has been doing this ever since she wrote a poem with the evocative title ""Le Grand Tanneur"" (The Great Tanner) in 2006, and deploys this approach in paintings whose organic forms refer to landscape, taking uson a journey through a large imaginary body. Flattened by a series of cuts inspired by the shapes of anatomical plates, these bodies, open like coats, house multiple worlds whose capillary effects always occur on the edge of the landscape, on the boundary between the exterior and the interior. In these ""interior landscapes"", Lucie Picandet uses topographical analogies that borrow from ecology, the notion of earth and humus, and from medicine, through notions of cosmetics and symptoms, surface and depth, healing and repair. By paying homage to the figure of the earthworm, or the parasite, she turns our attention to the gestation of living forms that takes place beneath our feet, or that of the vast microbial world that our bodies harbour. Her 'hospitable landscapes' welcome the evils of the earth and transform them into exuberant flora. In the ""mythical subterranean city"" of Agartha, painted in 2022, and of which the cave painted this year is perhaps an extension, ""the drops of sweat from our sick world fall to find a place of choice, they are set like precious stones"". Lucie Picandet's work seems to be entirely influenced by the Platonic notion of the ""Pharmakon"", revived by the philosopher Jacques Derrida to reflect on the paradoxical dynamics of written expression. It is both a source of ills and cures, a poison and a remedy, an outlet that is as addictive as it is liberating.So, within this imaginary pharmakological universe, animated by inter-species solidarity networks, she imagined it Incarnatrices. “Unlike carnivorous plants, they allow spirits or ideas to pass through their long, nourishing stems to form, take shape and blossom into brilliantly beautiful flowers.” “They are life machines, halfway between a totem (or sceptre) and an alien. They express (...) the mystery of Greek phusis : that by which life grows”. Should we put Lucie Picandet's multi-dimensional, multi-directional glasses on our nose, they will reveal how the extraordinary meticulousness of her paintings is a poetic incitement to suspend the many technological constructions that take us away from the sensitive world, and to enter fully into a nature that is also profoundly our own, to carve out its future with the strength of renewed wonder, and without fear of its desires.Marguerite Pilven",Lucie Picandet: Charnières,"33 & 36 Rue de Seine, 75006",Mon-Sat 10.30am-7.30pm, 29 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

Red, pink and blue flowers with generous, open petals. Animals too. Carp, cranes, peacocks. Various plants.These are familiar motifs. These are the patterns found on Manila shawls, embroidered stoles closely associated with Spain but whose origins are more complex. Historically made in China, they were shipped between the 16th and 19th centuries on the galleons of the Spanish Empire via the Philippines and Mexico, before finally arriving in Spain to become a traditional folk accessory and a typical symbol.In a double movement of deconstruction and illumination, Pilar Albarracín has chosen to use them as motifs for a series of recent works called Almas Robadas « Stolen souls » in English, isolating them and reproducing them on paper on a large scale. Then in her studio turned into an embroidery workshop - a medium familiar to the artist born in 1968 in Seville - a metamorphosis takes place. Busy around the large drawings, a makeshift sewing workshop covers the backs of the painted flowers and animals with thousands of pins that precisely follow the coloured lines and contours.They redraw them by piercing the paper in a repeated, almost ritualistic gesture. Literally pinned, the motifs change in meaning, nature and appearance.Imitating the fabric, their steel second skin is both captivating and unsettling. This duality is part of their story and is embodied in the space: the works can be seen on both sides, presenting two opposing facets. Two different visions of the same reality. One seductive and violent, the other harmless and neutral. It is a question of point of view.If you look up, you will see another equally ambivalent sight in the form of the installations Rompimiento de gloria I and II from the Lujo Iberico series (2001). Their title refers to the technique used in painting and high relief from the Renaissance to the Baroque period to separate the earthly and celestial worlds. Here Pilar Albarracín has fun linking them together, with the humour and irreverence that characterizes her work. Hailing from Sierra de Aracena where the emblematic Iberian Pata Negra is made, the artist transforms the gallery into a sumptuous delicatessen, hanging from the ceiling a set of dark velvet pieces in the shape of chorizo and blood sausage, which she considers to be her version of Proust’s madeleine cakes. It is a way of coming to terms with a given cultural heritage, of playing with it and combining the vulgar with the sacred by dressing everyday sausage in fabric worn by kings and religious dignitaries.« Alta Tensión », her new exhibition at Galerie G.P & N. Vallois, is something of a melting pot. A melting pot of different worlds, traditions, eras and dominations. Pilar Albarracín goes back in time and history, revisiting established narratives, codes and clichés that forge cultures and identities, assigning and fixing people and ideas.She pins them down, turns them around and questions them with genuine gentleness and intensity.Barbara Soyer",Pilar Albarracín: Alta tensión,"33 & 36 Rue de Seine, 75006",Mon-Sat 10.30am-7.30pm, 29 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

Duong’s mother had, herself, trained as an artist, but gave up painting when her children were born. Duong studied ballet in Paris until age twenty-three, training with the Nora Kiss Academy of Classical Dance and Tessa Beaumont, complementing her ballet studies with an erudition in architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. American architect-turned-photographer David Seidner launched Duong into the fashion world when he executed a set of photographs of Duong in 1985. This prompted Duong’s modeling career, working with Christian Lacroix and Isaac Mizrahi, and a coeval career in Hollywood, where Duong acted as a glamorous gangster’s moll in The Mambo Kings (1992), an immigrant tailoress in Scent of a Woman (1992), and a Louise Brooks character in thirty (1993). By 1988, Duong had left Paris and relocated to New York where she met and moved in with Julian Schnabel, who regularly painted Duong’s slender, Modigliani-like visage and encouraged her painting practice. Three years later, Sperone Westwater Gallery showed Duong’s first painting show in New York; Duong’s inaugural self-portrait, Summer in Montauk (1988), was included in a 1997 show at the PMMK Museum of Modern Art in Ostend, Belgium. Soon, in 1999, the Galerie Jerome de Noirmont in Paris exhibited Duong’s first solo show of self-portraits. Notably, in 2006, she was commissioned by Barry Diller to execute a nine-foot stainless steel sculpture of Diane von Fürstenberg. Since then, Duong has had numerous one-woman shows of her work at venerable institutions, including Sonnabend Gallery (New York, 2011), Robilant + Voena (London, 2014), and Galerie Gmurzynska, where she has been regularly exhibiting since 2021.Duong’s work belongs to public collections including the National Portrait Gallery (Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D.C.) and the Statue of Liberty Museum, New York, which commissioned Duong’s 50 sculpted stars for the new museum entrance in 2019. Duong’s work also belongs to illustrious private collections, including filmmakers, artists, architects and designers ranging from Dennis Hopper to Bruno Bischofberger, Spyros Niarchos, Simon de Pury, Patrick Painter, and Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana. Duong has gained widespread acclaim for her singular portraits, painting the likeness of Vincent Gallo, Susan Sarandon, Anjelica Huston, Karen Elson, Christian Louboutin. A number of these portraits are on display in Galerie Gmurzynska’s new show, which spans the breadth of Duong’s portraiture.There is a characteristic fleshiness to Duong's portraits—a crisp fleshiness, distinct from the Neo- Expressionist thickets of Jenny Saville’s brushwork and the flat roseate nudes of Maureen Dougherty’s sprightly fêtes galantes. Duong’s paintings are executed in veristic style and uncompromisingly theatrical in substance; they are tethered to an elliptical world striped with narratives that we only catch glimpses at. There is a cinematic quality to Duong’s use of light and her composition, her splinter-scenes rife with narratives attested to by her titles (e.g., Apres la Dispute (After the fight), 2006; The Gentlewoman or the Aggravation of our Incoherences, 2022; Between Epicureanism and Stoicism, 2022). More often than not, Duong’s subjects are women. Though they might flaunt the vaudeville garb of an 18th century empresses donned in russet-curled wigs and half-sheeted in knight’s armor, as in The Impossible Gender Frontiers (2022), Duong’s women are palpably real and contemporary. They are real in their playful attire, dressing for themselves alone, and they are real in how lamplight or the sun’s rays bounce between the furrows of their skin, revealing pocks and ridges. Duong’s likeness is thoroughgoing, the artist’s most consistent motif amidst changes in proportion, setting, and age. Such is the confessional nature of Duong’s oeuvre, which oscillates between portraiture, self-portraiture, and still lifes of resplendent plants, bejeweled pumps, and shriveled paint tubes, their contents exhausted.",Anh Duong: The Incoherences of a Gentlewoman,"43 E 78th Street, NY 10075","Mon-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 9 Feb  - 31 May 2024

"Galerie Max Hetzler, Potsdamer Straße",Berlin,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/mark-grotjahn-kitchens/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Mark Grotjahn,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/mark-grotjahn/,"Over the course of three decades, Mark Grotjahn has produced a diverse oeuvre which pushes the boundaries of visual language. Encompassing painting, drawing and sculpture, his multimedia practice foregrounds the tensions and intersections between the abstract and figurative divide. The artist works in distinctive series with a meticulous, almost obsessive drive. Treading the line between geometry and gesture, Grotjahn has developed a unique pictorial lexicon that is at once idiosyncratic and continually evolving. Since his initial ‘Sign Exchange’ project in the 1990s, alongside other significant bodies of work, the artist has gone on to create his renowned and ongoing series of ‘Butterfly’ drawings, with ‘50 Kitchens’ – first shown at LACMA in 2018 – amongst them. Comprising angular motifs, a capricious sense of symmetry, reductive forms and a vibrant palette, Grotjahn seeks to challenge and upturn the hermetic structures of artistic production.The ‘Kitchen Drawings’ originate from the ‘Butterfly’ compositions, which Grotjahn has made since 2001. Conceived as one work, the series originated from a single composition created to hang in Grotjahn’s kitchen in his home. With the first drawn in black and cream pencil on a sheet of paper, the subsequent works in the series followed on from one another in chromatic pairs. Some of these are more tonal, while others explore radiating, almost complementary colours. Hung precisely to the artist’s specifications, they form a prismatic display. While the individual works are reminiscent of Op art painters, they invite movement from the viewer, more in line with the Kinetic artists of the 1970s. Impossible to view as a whole at any given moment, the works appear to shift and change, pulsating beneath the viewer’s gaze. Resulting in multiple points of view through space, as well as in motion, the different serial elements play off one another. In addition to movement, both light and the differing hues which result from the sun’s changing intensity play an important role. In this way, the work is as much comprised of the paper and coloured pencils from which the independent drawings are executed, as the viewer’s own temporal and wavering perception.This time-based element corresponds to the succession in which Grotjahn's individual compositions are made: drawn one on top of the other on the artist’s table, each new drawing seamlessly incorporates residual traces from earlier works. Michael Govan, director of the LACMA, likens this sense of flow to ‘the residue of our life events of one year, [which] may become the ground of the next. The color of each one of our years is distinctive but somehow related to one another in ways that aren’t systematic even though our day to day rituals may be repetitive. The small unexpected interruptions, messy bits, and mistakes of our lives remain inscribed in our memory. We draw around them to fill in a picture of our experience.’ (1)Colour, form, space, movement and time thus combine to form force-fields which are not unlike the polyphony of music. Tension fields and quiet movements supersede one another as the viewer turns to look at the successive drawings in the exhibition space.Mark Grotjahn (*1968, Pasadena California) lives and works in Los Angeles. The artist’s work has been the subject of solo exhibitions in institutions including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (2018); Casa Malaparte, Capri (2016); Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas; Kunstverein Freiburg (both 2014); Aspen Art Museum (2012); Portland Art Museum (2010); Kunstmuseum Thun (2007); The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2006); and Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2005).

After studying at Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem and Cooper Union in New York, Hod began his artistic career in figuration, where he provoked his viewers by painting androgynous self-portraits and cigarette-smoking children. Around 2018, he shifted his focus onto abstraction, drawing on a technical process developed by the US Navy to create his signature chrome paintings. The shimmering and mirrored effect of this technique, oscillating between abstraction and reflection, incorporates the viewer as participant, creator, and spirit projected onto the picture surface. The new body of work debuting at Palm Beach offers both: the challenging imagery that is at once familiar and unsettling, with the implication of the audience into its world.In I Don’t Want to Forget You, Hod carefully examines personal and collective memory as it relates to identity, sexuality, religion, and culture at large. Each composition draws upon various source images—whether borrowed or imagined—splicing them together to create a single, cohesive picture. Hod views this referential process as enacting a “twist,” reformulating preexisting iconography to bear new meanings. In works like The Back Room (2022), Hod offers new ways to read the symbol of a white dove by representing its flight underground, suggesting something morbid and crypt-like about conventional notions of peace and liberty. His work, in this way, seeks to produce novel resonances within our iconographic lexicon, both of harmony and dissonance—giving the established symbols of a running woman, candle, and dove, etc., a bold expansion.Hod paints alla prima in monochrome to evoke the material softness of faded, old photographs and newspaper images—emphasizing the way by which pictures, much like language, function as epistemological apparatuses to disseminate information and shape our lives. In seeking to evolve this visual vernacular, Hod’s paintings constitute a kind of diary, wherein he imbues a personal, emotional register into our otherwise conventional, iconographic language. More than a personal diary, though, Hod’s new body of work motivates us to reassess the way we absorb images, pointing to all that is at risk of being forgotten by the wayside of our symbolic conventions. As he says, the paintings are both “who I am” and “life around me.”Together, the works on view ask us to consider our place in their iconographic world, to locate our personal investments in their language. In this way by which he attends to the spectator’s positionality and subjectivity, Hod harkens back to the reflective surface of his Chrome paintings to advance a diverse practice centered around the scene of encounter between picture and person. As such, his works are familiar yet surprising, personal yet common, and cognitive yet deeply emotional.About the ArtistNir Hod is an Israeli artist based in New York. Drawing from his memories, as well as harrowing historical events, Hod instills a delicate tension that challenges the viewer’s expectations within his paintings through the use of material. Hod is known for his chrome canvases, which use a unique method he developed after visiting a fabrication workshop. His paintings undergo an intense process that was originally developed by the US Navy in 1939. Through a meticulous, and at times ruthless approach, the canvases are manipulated through the use of ammonia, acids, and air pressure over washes of oil underpainting. Hod focuses on the resulting reflective sheens, which achieve a remarkable transformation, momentarily shifting an abstract composition into a figurative painting, casting the viewer’s image onto the work itself.Hod studied at Jerusalem's Bezalel Academy and New York's Cooper Union School of Art. He has exhibited internationally throughout the United States, Europe, Israel, and Japan, including GAVLAK, Palm Beach, FL; Makasiini Contemporary Gallery, Finland; Michael Fuchs Gallery, Berlin, Germany; Paul Kasmin Gallery, New York; Alon Segev Gallery, Israel; Davide Gallo Gallery , Berlin; Jack Shainman Gallery, New York; Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Tel Aviv; Rosenfeld Gallery, Tel Aviv; Liebman Magnan Gallery, New York; Lime Light Club, New York; Miami-Dade Community College, Wolfson Galleries, Miami; The Museum of Israeli Art, Ramat Gan, Israel; Mary Fauzi Gallery, Tel Aviv; Noga Gallery of Contemporary Art, Tel Aviv.

Spotlighting Post-War artists long overlooked until recent decades, Gazelli Art House invites audiences to experience an amalgamation of diverse artistic voices that defined an era. Amidst a notable surge of interest in twentieth-century female abstract artists, ignited by Mary Gabriel’s pivotal book Ninth Street Women, the Montage show at Gazelli Art House offers a fresh perspective, delving into the diverse practices of women in abstraction, while also recognising Europe’s profound impact on the American Abstract Expressionist movement.Helen Frankenthaler’s works are a fusion of spontaneity and control, evidenced in her famed “soak-stain” technique, where she poured diluted paint onto unprimed canvas, allowing colours to blend organically. In 1973, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s exhibition Sixty-two Painted Book Covers, showcased Frankenthaler, a book about Helen Frankenthaler’s paintings, featuring a cover by Robert Motherwell and commentary by Barbara Rose. The special edition showcased uniquely painted cloth covers, transforming the book, as curator John J. McKendry highlights, “Frankenthaler, like a true artist-magician, has transformed this book. She has made a book on art into a work of art”.Nancy Grossman’s collages reveal a striking interplay of fragmented imagery and bold textures, offering a visceral exploration of the human psyche and societal constructs. Through her meticulous arrangement of materials, Grossman, as seen in Untitled (1963), pushes the boundaries of collage as a medium, infusing her work with a raw intensity that captivates viewers and invites contemplation of themes such as power, identity, and vulnerability.Grace Hartigan, renowned for her fearless exploration of form and colour, anchors the exhibition with her dynamic collages, offering viewers a glimpse into the visceral energy that characterised the Abstract Expressionist movement. The disparate elements in Hartigan’s work mirrors the emotional intensity and spontaneity inherent in this influential movement. During her time residing and working in New York, Hartigan cultivated a enduring fascination with jazz. Her artistic expression seen in Jazz in New York (1957) echoes the syncopated beats and free-flowing nature reminiscent of 1950s modern jazz.Through carefully arranged fragments of varying shapes and textures, Lilly Fenichel’s dynamic compositions and gestural brushwork emanate an irrepressibly vigorous energy, as seen in Collage IV (1961). Calligraphic forms are a common theme throughout Fenichel’s artwork, as was the influence of nature and Colour Field painting on her practice.Celebrated for her nuanced approach to abstraction, Perle Fine’s collages are a testament to her mastery of form and balance. Fine’s meticulous compositions reveal a profound engagement with texture and colour, offering a contemplative counterpoint to the more spontaneous expressions present in the collection. During the mid- 1960s, Fine produced a collection of painted wood reliefs, such as Supersonic Calm (c.1966), where individual components appeared fragmented, yet seamlessly integrated into a unified whole.Betty Parsons’ intuitive use of materials and keen sense of composition are showcased via a selection of collages and wooden assemblages that underscore her role as a catalyst for innovation. Parsons utilised vibrant hues to evoke emotional response, and while her style evolved over the years, her commitment to abstraction remained constant. In 1965, Parsons revisited sculpture, an art form that had been among her earliest mediums. She delved into experimentation with found materials such as driftwood, signage, and disassembled furniture gathered from the beach near her home. Transforming these elements into shapes reminiscent of buildings, toys, or masks, Parsons treated these assemblages with paint in a manner akin to her approach on canvas. This process, evident in works like Sound Melody (1977) and Untitled (Pink, Orange and Gray) (c.1970), breathed new life into these neglected objects, infusing them with the aura of mementos. These sculptures bear a profound connection to Parsons’ enduring fascination with the mysticism inherent in Native American craft and artistic production.Yvonne Thomas’ intricate layering and sensitivity to the emotive potentialities of colour offer soft landscapes of buoyant, abstract forms akin to the style seen in Collage (1958). Thomas was fascinated by the symbolism inherent in colours and the formation of her works hold an almost lyrical quality.Sonja Sekula, a luminary whose work often defies categorisation, contributes collages that transcend traditional artistic boundaries. Sekula’s inventive use of materials and layered compositions challenges preconceived notions of space and dimension, Untitled Collage (1959) exemplifies the avant-garde spirit of Abstract Expressionism while reflecting her surrealist influences. Her art gained recognition with her inclusion in prominent exhibitions such as Peggy Guggenheim’s Art of this Century and the Betty Parsons Gallery, as well as the landmark 1951 9th Street Show.Michael Corinne West’s works, ranging from heavily impastoed Cubist pieces to explosive collage compositions, reflect her intuitive and ever-evolving artistic approach. Through bold experimentation and a fusion of emotional intensity, West’s oeuvre enriches the legacy of New York’s Abstract Expressionist movement, while her exploration of automatism and Surrealist influences, alongside her anxieties about Cold War politics, imbue her work with a profound depth and complexity. One such example is Untitled (1979), a striking piece rendered in charcoal and collage on paper.",Montage,"39 Dover Street, W1S 4NN","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-7pm", 17 May  - 13 Jul 2024

While Shenstone's works already sit in esteemed collections such as the National Portrait Gallery and the Sainsbury Centre, there remains an imperative to further champion her extraordinary practice in its own right.

His colourful works of vibrant geometric patterns are inspired by a wide range of influences, from Ewe and Asante cloth to jazz, the tradition of mural painting and the design of street kiosks along the roads of West-African towns. Kwami is known for expanding the notions of painting, basing his practice both in the visual world of his native Ghana and in reflections on modernism.The exhibition showcases work from 1999 to 2021, alongside an abstracted Kiosk structure Money Can’t Buy It (2019) constructed of found wood and conceived of as expanded three-dimensional paintings. The architectural scale work reference to the improvised vernacular of Ghanaian street painting. The show expounds on the range of influences on Kwami’s practice including his extensive travel across the African continent.Included in the show is the untitled painting that forms the foundation of his mural Dzidzɔ kple amenuveve (Joy and Grace) currently on view at Serpentine in London until September.Atta Kwami (b. 1956, Accra, Ghana, d. 2021, UK) studied, and later taught at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). In 2007, Kwami received a PhD in art history, now published as Kumasi Realism, 1951-2007: An African Modernism, in which he sought to explore past and present influences on West African art, with an emphasis on street art traditions throughout Kumasi, Ghana. He wrote about how his work was ‘described conventionally as “abstract”’ – but, he explained, ‘given that there is a very precise, knowable set of resources at the back of it, I would describe it rather as schematic: not like a map, but like a reaction to or interpretation of a map [...] the outcome of a series of engagements between practices, forms and visual environments that are specific to me in Ghana.’In 2021, the year he died, he was awarded the prestigious Maria Lassnig prize, which recognised later career artists deserving wider career recognition, and, in 2022, The Serpentine unveiled the final public mural commission by Kwami, DzidzƆ kple amenuveve (Joy and Grace), which remains on view until September 2024.This Spring, the Serpentine will publish a monograph edited by Melissa Blanchflower titled Atta Kwami, with Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther und Franz König, Köln supported by The Maria Lassnig Foundation and marking the first publication dedicated to examining the breadth of Kwami’s singular practice.Kwami’s work has been exhibited widely, notably creating large- scale public art commissions such as at the Folkestone Triennial in 2021 for which the artist made short-term alien interventions in the landscape. Solo exhibitions include: National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC (1994-1995), SOAS, University College of London (1996), Geometric Organic, National Museum Accra (1998-1999) and Kunsthalle Basel, Basel (2001).Kwami’s work is included in major collections around the world, including the National Museums of Ghana and Kenya; the V&A Museum, London; British Museum, London; the National Museum of African Art, Washington, DC; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, New York.",Atta Kwami,"26 Cork Street, W1S 3ND","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-4pm", 16 May  - 29 Jun 2024

These images in the paintings’ ground layer span a range of sources, from the deeply personal and autobiographical to the public and political. From the former category, Binion uses facsimiles of his birth certificate and his address book, as well as photographs of himself, his hand, and of his father and mother. Meanwhile, discernible segments from a musical score that Binion commissioned from the Pulitzer-prize winning composer and saxophonist Henry Threadgill point to the critical role that music and improvisation have played in Binion’s work. Of the latter category is a detail from a photograph published in a 1930s newspaper of a lynching in Marion, Indiana, the dissemination of which confronted the nation with the reality of racial violence. Customary to his practice, Binion obscures the under conscious with washes of ink in novel color combinations and a lattice-like layer in paint stick, the artist’s chosen materials since the 1970s.Me and You is the gallery’s second exhibition with McArthur Binion and the first show in Chicago to include the work of celebrated New York photographer Jules Allen. Allen studied photography under Jack Welpott, whose formalist leanings were rooted in the tradition of Ansel Adams and Edward Weston, and he received a MS in clinical psychology to better understand the human subject. In 1978, Allen moved to New York, where he met Binion among a rich milieu of Black avant-garde musicians and artists. Allen pursued both studio and commercial work for clients including Def Jam Recordings, became a professor at Queensborough Community College, and participated in the Kamoinge Workshop, all as he honed his vision in photographing Black urban life. Me and You surveys Allen’s gelatin silver prints from the 1980s to present, spanning bodies of work including Hats and Hat Nots, In Your Own Sweet Way, and Rhythmology. The photographs reference a lineage that includes Romare Bearden, Henri Cartier Bresson, Robert Frank, Beuford Smith, and Roy DeCarava, with whom Allen also studied. Allen’s keen sense of formal elements such as light, line, and tonality, are used in combination with personal insight and empathy to create a communal portrait across scenes like a street baptism in Harlem, a woman waiting for the subway, teenagers working out on the street, and a line of police behind a single, elderly protestor.Me and You commemorates a forty-year dialogue between the two artists, whose mutual admiration originated in the Black avant-garde of 1980s New York City. Absorbing visual, musical, and poetic influences throughout their careers, both artists pair visual clarity and formal rigor with deeply psychological and emotional content.The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue, with a dialogue between McArthur Binion and Jules Allen and an introduction by Dr. Thulani Davis.",McArthur Binion and Jules Allen: Me and You,"2044 West Carroll Avenue, IL 60612",Tue-Sat 11am-5pm, 12 Apr  - 31 May 2024

Each canvas appears in flux, like a chemical reaction still unfolding, with the underlying image itself variously willed into or out of reach.Language, textual and visual, is fundamental to decoding Mollett’s surfaces. The exhibition’s title Corso hints at the multiplicity of overlapping concepts with which the artist engages. With much of the work on view gathered from recent residencies - including one in 2023 in Turin, Italy - the title Corso is taken from the Italian word that can mean either ‘street’ or ‘stream,’ highlighting the intertwining of the architectural and natural. The artist arrived in Turin not long after a flood caused sections of the river Po to overflow its banks. The often overlooked minutiae of the town were thrown into sharp relief, as tree roots, cracks in the road, fluorescent fencing and peeling barks were cast in new, reflective detail. Following her time in Italy, Mollett was later in residence in Cortachy, Scotland, looking at iridescence and lichens. Exploring the connections and disparities in each environment led to an openness when translating her observations back in her London studio, as time and space became compressed and reintegrated in her layered, painterly forms.Phrases such as ‘in corso,’ however, can also mean ‘in progress,’ ‘happening’ or ‘current’, denoting the passage of time and finding parallels in the movement and vitality of Mollett’s handling of paint, a feeling that there is growth and change occurring as her images unfold. This sensation of growth in an organic or biological sense, too, is vital to this body of work.Though derived from multiple, often literal sources - the observation of a landscape, city, insect or plant - the act of painting gives life to new forms that are generative, reproducing like spores and formed by (the movement of) color. A description or translation discovered in one painting engenders another painting. These are images constantly in pursuit of further forms to grow, stretch, record and bear witness.This necessarily then implies experience as embodied. For both artist and viewer, there is a process of destabilising and re-situating or reconstituting a sense of place and time. Mollett’s work is a consideration of space through slow looking, slow feeling, of scrutinising an environment not at a distance but as a personal relationship. To view these works is to view the act of interpreting memory as recalled over a period of months, the storing and revisiting of space in the mind’s eye, making explicit the pliability and fallibility of perception. The nature of painting space and time, as with the nature of perceiving it first hand, is ultimately elusive and fragile.Francesca Mollett (b. 1991, Bristol, UK) received her MA in Painting from the Royal College of Art, London (UK) in 2020, having previously studied at the Royal Drawing School and Wimbledon College of Art, London (UK).

Across the works on view in the exhibition is a desire for recollection, of exploring the past in order to make sense of the present. For Inniss, painting can be a vehicle for accessing a subconscious, emotional state and a means of scrutinising memories, both voluntary and involuntary.The genesis of painting for Inniss begins outside the studio itself, with a semi-diaristic practice in which the artist attempts to record in detail instances when she experiences olfactory memory, the strong association of a time and place with a specific scent. By attempting to recall the sights, sounds and thoughts that accompany smell, the artist observes the fallibility and hierarchies of visual memory; spaces come into focus whilst, simultaneously, abstract absences are revealed.Compositions start to be derived through drawings from these self-observations, clarifying the emotionally resonant and collapsing the past onto the present. Often architectural in their nature, the works appear as interiors devoid of figures, with details of rooms or passages highlighted. Often interspersed with a subtle floral motif or overlaid with the branches of trees, there is a feeling of nature reclaiming urban space or of competing timelines compressed. For Inniss, painting becomes a tool to explore her own cerebral archive, utilising memory as an act of “willed creation”, an idea inspired by Toni Morrison’s essays in The Source of Self-Regard. Painting from memory is therefore not simply a way to assess how something truly was but a means of scrutinising how and why things appear the way they do once committed to memory.Often sketching from an image in her mind’s eye, the artist visualises her own patterns of thought and questions why certain events or elements appear more clearly than others. Working light to dark, Inniss begins with the brightest white tones at the surface, before applying a mid-tone across the canvas then following with darker passages, producing a kind of inverted image, like a developing photographic negative. The process and the result itself recall flashbulb memory, the near-photographic recollection of emotional experience. Translated into paint, the images, like our own subconscious recall, can be mysterious and lacking in detail, bringing about certain biases. The images reveal both fact and absence, exposing hierarchies of individual thought and memory, with specific colours, figures and sceneries coming into focus, while others remain unearthed or misremembered.Choices about the painting’s scale and the shape of canvas indicate the feel of a certain memory, some smaller, more tentative, others dominant, enveloping and immersive. This is true also of the mark-making, with some more sparse or hesitant, flickering into focus, while others are bold and graphic and delineate a clear geometry to define a room or landscape. The handling and layering of paint also speak to the form of memory, with areas of translucence recalling overlapping or transient experience, deployed as washes over the canvas in thinned-out oils.Gaps in understanding, however, might also produce a need to be filled in. The paint is often lent an additional physicality through layering gesso or adding sand to the paint to create texture as a kind of stubbornness, something to offset the alarm caused by the imminent possibility of forgetting. Memories, often imbued with a kind of dreamlike logic or lack of logic, also find visual analogy in paint, with long shadows cast from objects with no discernible source of light and stark uses of light and shadow giving an overall sense of the otherworldly.Throughout all the paintings in this exhibition, Inniss points to different facets of memory as a performative act and not a static reality. In particular, the artist draws on her own personal experience as a woman of dual heritage in order to question how spaces are constructed and how she remembers them, exploring both the clarity of - but also gaps within - memory to reflect her own nuanced lens of understanding the world.",Hettie Inniss: Rememories from the Floating World,"2 Bourdon Street, W1K 3PA","Wed-Sat 11am-6pm, Tue by appointment", 30 May  - 20 Jul 2024

I wanted to reflect and celebrate the vibrant cultural life in Brixton and London. We have suffered a great deal past few years but the resilience and healing powers of people have always found a way to overcome adversities throughout the history. People and places in the mural tell us a story of each community within Brixton and London. I feel that we have endured difficult and hard times in the past, facing challenges of the present and looking forward to a bright future.“In this expansive work, Panchal captures a collective portrait reflecting our enduring resilience and interconnectedness. Depicting various Londoners engaged in different roles - an artist, an NHS worker, a waiter, among others - the painting also incorporates elements of the cityscape, including landmarks like the Black Cultural Archives, Brixton Windmill, and Tate Modern. Notably, it features memorials such as The African and Caribbean War Memorial and the Cherry Groce Memorial Pavilion in Windrush Square, symbolizing both cherished places and individuals, as well as the losses and struggles faced. These elements come together to celebrate, commemorate, and inspire as we navigate through shared experiences and strive to rebuild.Panchal has also done two other public commissions in London - Across the Barrier, which was a part of the Anti-Racism Mural, GLC, Lowood Street, Shadwell, Tower Hamlets (1985) and the Roxborough Bridge Mural, Harrow (1994).During his early years in London, as well as while traveling across Europe and America, Shanti noticed a historical neglect of watercolour's potential compared to oil and acrylic. Instead of exploring its depths, watercolour seemed confined to conventional subjects like flowers and landscapes, which proved frustrating for him. Unwilling to conform to these limitations, he embarked on an obsessive journey of artistic exploration.His dedication led him to experiment with various sizes, from large canvases to small paper sheets. Seeking depth, he abandoned traditional colour mixing on palettes and opted to apply colours directly onto the paper, encouraging them to penetrate its fibres. Through relentless hammering and scraping, his process evolved, blending success and failure into each stroke. Layers upon layers of colour became a metaphor for life experiences, simultaneously ecstatic and despairing.The earthy tones dominating his palette reflected his upbringing in a Gujarati village, inspiring a deeply personal visual language. His paintings depicted family life, where privacy was a foreign concept, yet each character carved out inner sanctuaries amidst their shared space, revealing poignant loneliness.Despite the prevalent belief that ""painting is dead"", a notion persisting since the invention of photography in 1839, Shanti adamantly believed in its enduring relevance. For him, painting is not just alive but also uniquely meaningful, fuelling his dedication to push boundaries. He foresaw that the debate surrounding painting's relevance would persist into the 21st century and beyond, emphasizing its unparalleled ability to capture human nature and the cosmic forces shaping our existence.While many contemporary artists pursued a detached, machine-like quality in their work, Shanti sought to infuse his creations with spiritual depth and passion. His influences range from the mystical visions of El Greco and William Blake to his own Hindu sensibility, grounding his vision in a rich tapestry of spirituality and tradition.The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue which includes a detail biography of the artist and an essay by writer, critic, and curator Andrew Lambirth.",Shanti Panchal: Endurance,"35 Bury Street, St. James's, SW1Y 6AY",Mon-Fri 10am-5pm, 10 May  - 2 Jun 2024

She embodies these dualities through a calculated foundational pattern – the strips, along with a much looser, almost freehand-woven image on its upper layer. The foundational layer serves as the bedrock, acting as a steadfast framework. The upper layer bursts forth with variation and negotiation, resulting in a mesmerizing, orderly, yet wildly free contrast. This construct carries myriad cultural and social weights, both ancient and contemporary. Whether it’s a set of landscapes, motifs, or an assemblage of color fields interrogating the stripes, the audience is invited to witness the dynamic dialogue in a realm of constant polarity and harmony.The title of the show, “Variation on a Theme of Blue and Gray,” directly references an ancient music form dating back to the thirteenth century. Composers like Bach, Beethoven, and Schubert used this specific music form to expand various ideas from a single motif. Through Zhang’s early education in classical piano, she views the weaving machine as an instrument itself. This inquiry explores the indeterminacy of weaving as a physical experience, juxtaposed with the regularity of machines. The weaving technique involves the coexistence of incompatible conceptual systems—domestic construction, celebrity culture, visual conspicuousness, or institutional critique—all of which are equally valid. The constraints and limits of weaving reflect this phenomenon within the picture plane, highlighting the sensual pleasure of polychromatic banded materials. The stripes draw attention through their prominence in our visual field and entertain the eye with their shifting patterns, combinations of color, and ocular effects.Through ongoing exploration, rehearsal, and performance of weaving, using notations and instructions of warp and weft, Zhang formalizes the distinction between personal intention and formalist theory in her artistic expression. The instrumental indeterminacy of the weaving machine is used to perform in situations where the boundaries of the machinery process are experienced as ambiguous, fluid, reconfigurable, or undefinable by the artist. Her new series of paintings translates such situations into tangible forms, demonstrating how shimmer, colors, textures, and patterns of the material are integral to creating subjectivity. If the motif of stripes is about turning the personal into possession, Zhang’s work paradoxically suggests transforming the material into the personal through the conduit of meaning as use, allowing us to abandon control in the process.– Yuan FucaMiranda Fengyuan Zhang has had solo shows at Capsule Shanghai, Shanghai; Mendes Wood DM, São Paulo/Brussels; Halsey McKay Gallery East Hampton; and Candice Madey Gallery, New York.

Halsey McKay Gallery,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/shaun-odell/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Halsey-McKay.jpeg,Shaun O’Dell,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/shaun-odell/,"During a Pleiades meteor shower in Northern California I saw a meteorite flying 300 feet in the air trailing flames like a slow crashing sopwith camel about to plummet into a meadow. In a flash it went out and fell to earth leaving a trail of gray smoke in the black freezing air. The shape of the meteorite's extinguished smoke trail is fixed in my mind. We couldn’t find the rock the next day but I assume it was composed of a good amount of iron.Iron is one of the elements undoubtedly known to the ancient world. It comes from supernovae, the earth’s core and crust and meteorites. While iron is the most abundant element on Earth, most of this iron is concentrated in the inner and outer cores. Before people mined iron ore from the ground all the raw iron used for smelting it into a molten malleable medium for making objects came from outer space as meteorites. Most of the meteorites that fall to earth are composed of iron. Beads from 3500 BC found in Gerzeh, Egypt and a dagger found in Tutankhamun’s tomb are both made of meteoric iron.In mythology the Macranthrope, an allegorical depiction of the universe as a giant anthropomorphic body, issues metals from its flesh and blood. Iron embryos rebirth the metals on earth and are forged by humans into objects of use. These objects carry within them the transformative power of their origin in the macranthropic cosmos. For a good part of the Iron Age iron was mainly used for weapons and the tools used to make those weapons but by the early 17th century in Europe and America wrought iron made up nearly every kind of agricultural, industrial, architectural, domestic and decorative human made object.In his early 19th century Newport, Kentucky mercantile my ancestor Henry Behrman was surrounded by the wrought iron objects of early America -  kettles, flat irons, pots, kitchen utensils, trammels, broilers, cranes, shovels, toasters, waffle-irons, trivets, bells, hooks, lamps, lanterns, candle and rushlight holders, chandeliers, latches, hinges, locks, bolts, chains, knockers, handles, hasps, balconies, braces, foot scrapers, andirons, fireplace accessories, weather-vanes, shutter-fasteners, scissors, irons, plough plates, wagon and coach wheels, axe-bars, round and square bars of all sizes, stoves, stove backs, mill gudgeons, nails, iron gates and fences, ornamental porch and balcony railings, mantels, attic window grilles, handrails and building hardware.In my work I am drawn to locating moments in history - my own, American, the west and human - when markable shifts from the mythos to the logos, the miraculous to the end of enchantment, the infinite to the reductionism of the quantifiable can be unfixed and made permeable.  Something like a picture - both on the wall and in my mind - that I can step into and out of.  In the painting, ((((Ore Macranthropic Echo)))) I wanted to see the origin of the smoking iron-laden meteorite I saw fall from the Pleiades emerge from the macranthrope in the Kentucky woods of Henry Behrman’s mercantile. Depicting and superimposing the moment I saw the macranthrope’s offering in 2009 California onto Henry’s colonial era Kentucky establishes a nexus point for my invented, ancestral, human, material and mythological memory. A site to contemplate the ways in which not seeing and disconnection from the miraculous have produced a dissociation from our relationship with the natural world and its undeniable presence.Reconstructing a mythological framework as a tool to confront both the dissociative and miraculous qualities of being eventually creates a sound in my paintings. This is how I understand they are activated and transmitting. Before I can hear the painting, the works individually and as a collective expand and contract formally. This process becomes one of disassembly and inversion. Some works maintain a consistent size and remain contained on one piece of paper during their creation. Other works are constructed using multiple panels of paper that are eventually unified by their mount on canvas, but through their making leave artifacts within other works. As paper is cut, redrawn, reordered, rotated, and reassembled events occur between paintings that direct their evolution and whether they appear as anomalies in single instances or as a visual language speaking through reoccurrences in multiple events. How to make a taxonomy of something as it occurs, but happened in the past and evolves to the future? Perspectival shifts through multiple picture planes enfold history into formality, representation into abstraction, fluid occurrences into fixed images. – Shaun O’DellShaun O’Dell (b. 1968, Beeville, TX) received a BA from the New College of California, San Francisco, in 2002 and an MFA from Stanford University in 2004.

Hamiltons,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/nick-waplington-living-room/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Nick Waplington,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/nick-waplington/,"Nick Waplington’s first book, Living Room, was published in 1991, and was an instant sensation within the photography world and beyond. The 59 photographs in the original edition documented the lives of friends, families, and neighbours on the Broxtowe housing estate in Nottingham, England, where Waplington spent many years making thousands of images. This extensive archive of unseen photographs forms the basis of this new conceptual remake of the 1991 monograph, one that revisits and refashions Waplington’s iconic work from a contemporary vantage point. This new work follows the same sequencing of landscape and portrait images as the original edition - replacing each of the 59 photographs with an as-yet-unseen work from the Living Room archive, often from the same roll of film as the original image. The result is both familiar and uncanny, a vivid journey back to Thatcher’s Britain and a testament to the decades of art and life that have elapsed between then and now.Whilst Waplington’s early work was intrinsically rooted in ‘documentary’ practice, it also challenged the conventional documentary gaze. Simon Baker, director of Maison Européenne de la Photographie, importantly notes that Waplington employs a deeply humanistic approach which is resistant to voyeuristic or intrusive documentation. Indeed, Simon states: “Waplington is broadly curious and deeply committed in his work, and as serious about family life as politics or art, or music and the social cultures around it, but always as both witness and participant”, a method which achieves his simultaneous intimacy and invisibility.“When I thought something was going to happen, I’d pick up the camera and take some pictures very quickly and then put the camera down. And then not take any again for a while. You don’t want to be taking pictures all the time in a documentary-esque situation, because otherwise it becomes about you and the camera and not the situation. It’s about having an instinct for when something is going to happen.” – Nick Waplington.Waplington’s choice of a 6x9 camera, commended by John Berger in an essay in both the 1991 and 2024 publications of ‘Living Room’, produces a landscape crop where “the forms photographed have the space to expand, to become landscapes, or even firmaments“. The artist’s purposeful use of colour emanates American street landscape characteristics, mixed with a quintessentially British documentary style. Waplington reacts to what he describes as the common “grainy, downtrodden, black and white interpretation of working-class life”; instead, Waplington’s lens does not estrange the subjects from the viewers but turns the domestic into public in a way where tears, screams, jokes, solace, tiredness and pleasure have equal room.UK and US-based artist Nick Waplington works with photography as a medium to submerge in communities, resulting in personal involvement and visual work. He caught the attention of John Berger and Richard Avedon, along with the rest of the world, in the 1990s with Living Room and has since then created recognisable, frank representations of people and their socio-political backgrounds. Beginning in his teenage years, his subjects have ranged from post Punk youth culture against the backdrop of Thatcherism, to the heyday of House and rave culture in 1990s NYC. In 2008/9 Waplington documented the production of the last collection of Alexander McQueen at his London studio. He continues to work in London and New York on a series of overlapping photographic and art projects.Waplington has had solo shows as an independent artist across the UK and the USA, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art (The ‘Living Room’ and ‘Circles of Civilization’ Series, 1992), The Photographers’ Gallery London (‘Living Room’ 1990-1991) and more recently Tate Britain (‘Working Process’ 2015). His works have also featured in group shows at the Venice Biennale (‘Learn How To Die the Easy Way’, 2001), Brooklyn Museum in New York City (‘This Place’, 2016) and White Chapel Gallery (June-September 2017).His works are part of the permanent collections of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, Victoria and Albert Museum and Government Art Collection in London and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Alongside being honoured with the Infinity Award: Young Photographer in 1993 by the International Center of Photography in New York City.

Hauser,New York Chelsea,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/rita-ackermann-splits/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Rita Ackermann,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/rita-ackermann/,"Dr. Pamela Kort on Rita Ackermann’s exhibitions:SplitsTitled ‘Splits,’ Ackermann’s latest paintings mark a pinnacle in the artist’s ongoing concern with the creation of dynamic, moving images. In these canvases, forms cascade downward and upward, at times merging seamlessly into one another. To optimize the potential of such chance transformative processes, Ackermann conceptualized the canvas as divided into three screens, as she aptly calls them. This enabled her not only to guide the flow of line and paint, but also to forestall the coalescence of drawing and painting. No sketch prefigured the images that surfaced, except those carved into the recesses of her memory. Instead, Ackermann allowed an instinctive force to guide her hand as it moved across the fields before her.The fluctuation between the screens she populated with diaphanous lines and those carrying weightier, gestural strokes of color also conspired to infuse the paintings with an unexpected rhythm. In ‘Shut Eye’ (2023), for example, two screens brimming with fragments of drawn shapes entice the eye to actively pull open the middle register and thereby show more of the painted forms within. This occurs even as the upper and lower screens seem to press inward, creating a dynamic tension between revelation and concealment. To enhance this impression, Ackermann occasionally used luminous yellow pigment to further instill in these paintings a sense of lightness and transparency.Composed as a sequence of stacked-up semi-translucent frames, these canvases can also be seen as the visual equivalent of images imprinted on a film strip. Ackermann, in fact, draws parallels between the transformative essence of the images in the ‘Splits’ and the dynamic permutations observed when montaged photographic images are projected in a cinema. In both mediums, meaning opens in the infinitesimal split between what the eye sees and the elusive. There, a unique motion also unfolds, one that oscillates between appearance and truth. In all these paintings, there is mystery, one that hints at the presence of the profound and unknowable. Through their enigmatic allure, the ‘Splits’ encourage the viewer to ponder the ineffable, reminding us that while transcendence eludes sight, its essence can nonetheless reveal itself.Splits: Printing | PaintingIn the thick of bringing to canvas the metamorphic forms that would become the ‘Splits,’ Ackermann embarked on a new artistic endeavor, delving into the realm of printmaking. In the resultant seven large-scale silkscreens, which she produced in collaboration with master printer Keigo Takahashi, her concern with making manifest such images became imbued with a related objective: the transformation of paintings into prints, without recourse to the reproduction of a model. Though these silkscreens diverge from the compositional principles of the ‘Splits,’ like them they probe the boundaries of optical perception. To emphasize this, the exhibition includes two recent paintings. One of these—’The Rule of Nature’ (2023)—which belongs to the ‘Splits,’ even bears the marks of Ackermann’s concern with combining monotype printing with painting. Viewers who perceive that will nevertheless find it difficult to distinguish between the look of the other painting—’Misfit’ (2023)—and the silkscreens.This visual feat owes just as much to the artist’s decision to approach the making of these silkscreens as though she were working on a canvas, as to any sleight of the hand enabled by their production. Ackermann began by layering drawings onto paper and then gradually superimposed gestural brush strokes, color stains and delicate droplets of pigment onto the underlying drawings, welcoming the occurrence of accidents through this process. This not only made the contrast between emerging and disappearing forms integral to many of her paintings visible, but also conveyed a sense of the centrifugal motion that frequently ensues in them. As such, those who contemplate these first silkscreens by the artist may well find themselves questioning whether the alleged split between printmaking and painting is, in fact, purely theoretical.About the artistBorn in Budapest, Hungary, in 1968, Rita Ackermann currently lives and works in New York.Ackermann’s recent solo exhibitions include: ‘Hidden,’ MASI Lugano, Switzerland (2023); ‘Vertical Vanish,’ Hauser & Wirth Downtown Los Angeles (2023); ‘Mama ‘19,’ Hauser & Wirth New York, 22nd Street (2020); ‘Brother Sister,’ Hauser & Wirth Zurich, Switzerland (2019); ‘Movements as Monuments,’ La Triennale di Milano, Italy (2018); ‘Turning Air Blue,’ Hauser & Wirth Somerset, England (2017); ‘KLINE RAPE,’ Hauser & Wirth New York, 22nd Street (2016); ‘The Aesthetic of Disappearance,’ Malmö Konsthall, Malmo, Sweden (2016); ‘Chalkboard Paintings,’ Hauser & Wirth Zurich, Switzerland (2015); ‘MEDITATION ON VIOLENCE-HAIR WASH,’ Sammlung Friedrichshof, Burgenland, Austria and Sammlung Friedrichshof Stadtraum, Vienna, Austria (2014); ‘Negative Muscle,’ Hauser & Wirth New York, 69th Street (2013); ‘Fire by Days,’ Hauser & Wirth London, Piccadilly (2012); the Museum of Contemporary Art, Miami FL (2012); ‘Bakos,’ Ludwig Museum, Budapest, Hungary (2011); and ‘Rita Ackermann and Harmony Korine: ShadowFux,’ Swiss Institute, New York NY (2010).",Rita Ackermann.

Hauser,New York Chelsea,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/jennifer-rochlin-paintings-on-clay/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Jennifer Rochlin,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/jennifer-rochlin/,"Los Angeles-based painter Jennifer Rochlin embarked upon a shift toward three-dimensionality sixteen years ago when an unexpected teaching opportunity brought her into close contact with clay for the first time. Enchanted by its tactility and unpredictability, she discovered in the material a new channel for expression. Rochlin’s now-celebrated voluptuous clay vessels dominate the artist’s practice as canvases for her memories, idealized visions and the unfiltered biographical narratives she unspools over their undulating forms with palpable libidinal force. In her painted and glazed scenes, family, friends and partners are intertwined with trees and leaves that signify the passage of time through changing seasons. Wistfulness transitions seamlessly into humor or fades into unabashed adoration of nature’s enveloping beauty. Fluctuating between idealized depictions and unembellished honesty, Rochlin’s imagery conveys a tender and genuine sense of longing.Hauser & Wirth New York presents Rochlin’s most recent series of large-scale hand-built terra cotta vessels on which she offers up an autobiographical journey—intimate scenes of her life and loves, of nature observed and of her own responses to the greats of art history.Rochlin’s three-dimensional compositions coalesce largely without planning. While sketched in advance, the shapes of her vessels ultimately depart from classical form and symmetry through a laborious hand-building process that permits—indeed, encourages—distortion. Bodily, eccentric and imposing, the vessels’ commanding physicality prompts viewers to trace their curves and walk around them to follow the sequence of vignettes that travel their circumferences.Influenced by a background in experimental filmmaking, Rochlin’s paintings on clay have a distinct sense of movement and progression. She weaves together brief scenes with decorative patterns and natural elements, crafting cinematic montages in the round. ‘Trans-Siberian Railway’ (2023), for example, encapsulates a moment Rochlin captured on Super 8 film during her early travels along the Trans-Siberian Railroad in Russia. Steadying her camera on a man loitering by the tracks, she immortalized the instant he plucked purple irises from the ground and offered them to a woman leaning out of a passing train window. But in transferring this filmed story to a vessel, Rochlin has painted herself as the woman in the window, assuming the dual role of voyeur and protagonist. The train and its succession of windows ascend in a spiral reminiscent of a flickering film reel. Rochlin’s inclination toward romance is most evident here; always enlisting others, it serves as a driving force that propels her art forward.Rochlin likewise draws on her experiences in different parts of the world by incorporating tapestries and carpets encountered during her travels. Geometric patterns and decorative borders appear on such works as ‘Green Tapestry with Poppies and Bites’ (2024), in which rich green and chartreuse hues and delicate etched ornamentation travel along the wide curves of a bulbous form accented by three orange blossoms and three human bite marks.In 2018, Rochlin developed the unique method of biting into unfired clay and inviting others to participate in this form of mark making. The resulting imprints, often embellished with touches of purple and gold, resemble both bruises and blossoms. These bites, which appear on multiple vessels on view, indicate a chorus of willing collaborators and reflect Rochlin’s ongoing interest in seeking means to express erotic desire in gesture as well as image.This collaborative impulse continues in other works, too, such as ‘Honey Pot’ (2024), where more than twenty fellow female Los Angeles artists have intricately etched genitalia onto an imposing clay vessel, or in Rochlin’s loving visual quotations paying homage to Matisse and Giacometti. Whether through direct or indirect engagement, collaboration with other artists—both living and deceased—pervades her practice. Thus, Rochlin firmly asserts that she is not solitary in her pursuits but instead a member and beneficiary of a community formed across time.‘Jennifer Rochlin. Paintings on Clay’ will include small recent paintings by the artist, each corresponding to a specific vessel on view. Rochlin often makes such paintings of her pots, placing them in the landscape surrounding her house and studio to work plein air, rendering the very plants and colors that envelop the vessels’ surfaces. Since Rochlin does not create preparatory sketches for the figural narratives on her pots—she instead makes images spontaneously and intuitively in response to their forms—her vessels become veritable pages of a sketchbook, studies for paintings in a constant circuit of storytelling.About the artistJennifer Rochlin was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1968 and lives in Los Angeles, California. She received a Master of Fine Art from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1999, participated in an exchange at the Universität der Künste Berlin, Germany in 1998, and received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Colorado, Boulder in 1991. Rochlin is the recipient of the Individual Artist Grant from the Belle Foundation (2015) and the Durfee Foundation ARC grant (2007). She has had solo exhibitions at Sorry We’re Closed, Brussels, Belgium (2022); Shrine Gallery, New York NY (2022); The Pit, Los Angeles CA (2020); Maki Gallery, Tokyo, Japan (2020); and Lefebvre & Fils, Paris, France (2018) among others.

Challenging the hard-edged, manufactured aesthetic of the prevailing minimalist movement of her day, Hesse’s use of latex, Fiberglas and industrial plastics opened new possibilities in art. Half a century later, her groundbreaking oeuvre is as potent as it was in 1968, the year of the first and only exhibition of her sculptures held during her lifetime. That there have been some fifteen exhibitions in the decades following her death in 1970 is a testament to Hesse’s continued contemporaneity.Hauser & Wirth celebrates the 25th anniversary of the estate’s representation by the gallery by spotlighting Hesse’s remarkable achievements in ‘Eva Hesse. Five Sculptures.’ This exhibition, organized by Barry Rosen, longtime adviser to the Hesse estate, in collaboration with art historian and critic Briony Fer, reunites five of her most celebrated large-scale works, all on loan from major American museums and all made in the most intense period at the end of her life from 1967 to 1969. Installed on the ground floor of Hauser & Wirth’s gallery on West 22nd Street, the exhibition will emphasize the breadth, scope and impact of Hesse’s materially experimental and psychologically charged sculptures.In conjunction with the exhibition, Hauser & Wirth Publishers will release ‘Eva Hesse: Exhibitions, 1972–2022.’ Offering insight into Hesse’s milestone exhibitions from 1972 to the present day, this special volume addresses the ways in which exhibitions evolve from ideas to critical reception through the prism of Hesse’s work and her journey to becoming an icon of American art. Texts by the museum curators who made these shows reflect the personal dimension of crafting an exhibition, its intent and its reception. Edited by Barry Rosen and accompanied by extensive installation views, archival material, exhibition-related ephemera and snapshots, ‘Eva Hesse: Exhibitions, 1972–2022’ brings these exhibitions to life through the voices of Linda Shearer, Nicholas Serota, Ellen Johnson, Helen Cooper, Renate Petzinger, Elisabeth Sussman, Sabine Folie, Fred Wasserman, Catherine De Zegher, Fiona Bradley, Briony Fer, Luanne McKinnon, Petra Roettig, Brigitte Kölle, Andres Gyorody and Lena Stringari.About the exhibitionUnlike most of the abstract sculpture being produced at the time, Hesse’s works were abstract yet powerfully evocative of human corporality, laying bare the processes used to make them.‘The effect of a lot of Hesse’s large-scale sculpture is to put in question what you think you know about art.’ —Briony Fer.Seriality, connection and repetition were at the heart of Hesse’s creative process and are evidenced clearly in the earliest work on view in this exhibition, ‘Repetition Nineteen I’ (1967). On loan from The Museum of Modern Art, New York, this work is the first of three versions Hesse planned to make over a period of ten months. It is comprised of eighteen bucket-like forms, each a little over nine inches tall, and is the last piece Hesse made using papier-caché, a favored medium. Hesse originally planned a second version of ‘Repetition Nineteen’ in sheet metal coated with Sculp-Metal, but abandoned that idea when she began to work with rubber and latex. ‘Repetition Nineteen I’ is a key example from Hesse’s oeuvre, elucidating the artist’s emotionally suggestive use of form and space, and interest in objects that were visibly handmade and irregular.Although similar in size and shape, none of the cylindrical forms in ‘Repetition Nineteen I’ are exactly alike, creating a destabilizing and uncanny sense of doubling. Hesse kept their arrangement open-ended, insisting that they should not have a fixed order. The result is a responsive and provisional installation whose overall shape varies with each presentation. ‘I don’t ask that the piece be moved or changed, only that it could be moved and changed. There is not one preferred format,’ Hesse said.‘Area’ (1968), on loan from the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University in Columbus, was created in the summer of 1968 for Lucy Lippard’s landmark traveling exhibition ‘Soft and Apparently Soft Sculpture.’ For Hesse, ‘Area’ was important because of its underlying relationship to ‘Repetition Nineteen III.’ The artist explained: ‘‘Area’ is made from the mold of another piece, ‘Repetition Nineteen III.’ It is the insides that we took out. And then I made it into another piece. I mean there is no connection whatsoever except if you saw it, it is very clear… I rubberized the forms, attached them and sewed them together with wire and that is the piece… I have a personal attachment because it comes from another piece. I take a piece from one piece and make it totally another one. ‘Repetition Nineteen III’ was made of empty containers and there was that sexual connotation. It is anthropomorphic. ‘Area’ isn’t, or is in a totally different way. It is used as a flat piece with a suggestive three-dimensionality...’Both ‘Aught’ and ‘Augment,’ also made in 1968, will be installed just as they were for their public debut in that year’s now-legendary exhibition ‘9 at Leo Castelli.’ On loan from Glenstone Museum, ‘Augment’ comprises seventeen overlapping rectangular sheets of rubberized canvas (78 by 40 inches) placed on the floor. ‘Aught,’ borrowed from the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum, is comprised of four parts, each the same size as those in ‘Augment,’ hanging side-by-side along the wall. However, each of the four segments in ‘Aught’ are comprised of two sheets of rubberized canvas that have been attached at the edges and filled with polyethylene drop cloths, creating a slightly billowing effect on the surface, provoking viewers to feel the tension in the space––literal and psychological––between painting and sculpture.Finally, the monumental work ‘Expanded Expansion’ (1969), on loan from the Guggenheim Museum and made in the year before the artist’s death, embodies all her interests—especially her fascination with materiality, contradiction and absurdity. Hesse once described this piece as ‘opposite in form, large, looming, powerful yet precarious.’ Standing just over 10 feet tall and 30 feet wide when fully extended, ‘Expanded Expansion’ comprises thirteen panels made of fragile rubberized cheesecloth supported by rigid fiberglass and polyester resin poles. Its height is fixed by the length of the poles, but its width could originally be manipulated to expand or contract, so, like Repetition Nineteen I, its ultimate size is dependent on the qualities and limitations of its environment.",Eva Hesse.

In her drawings and paintings, there’s this sense of a dreamscape, a mosaic of her travels through the desert and from coast to coast.’Heilmann is known for working across mediums and for installations which playfully combine disparate works. Reflecting on the artist’s approach to exhibition-making, ‘Daydream Nation’ brings together works on paper, ranging from watercolor studies for larger paintings to works that function as paintings on paper in their own right, alongside a selection of her ceramic sculptures and sculptural chairs to create an ambiently whimsical yet conceptually rigorous environment. Heilmann often works in series, revisiting and reimagining certain arrangements of form and color over time, as evidenced here in such recurring motifs as the chair, rosebud, spiral, wave and web. But in Heilmann’s oeuvre, repetition begets difference and from this multiplicity emerges important truths about the functions of memory and our process of translating it.Drawing has always factored significantly into Heilmann’s practice, manifesting in a variety of forms in ‘Daydream Nation.’ The exhibition features a new mural-like installation that reimagines and expands an existing work into a new form of expression. Heilmann’s seventh wall drawing to date, this installation was developed in conversation with Simmons, who frequently explores the monumental scale of this medium in his own work.The title of this exhibition is taken from Sonic Youth’s groundbreaking album ‘Daydream Nation’ (1988), beloved by both Heilmann and Simmons. Evoking Heilmann’s longstanding interest in daydreaming as a creative exercise and the importance of travel for her in this process, it also situates her oeuvre within the culture of youthful rebellion in New York City, the California-born artist’s adopted home since 1968 and a constant source of energy and inspiration for her both personally and professionally.",Mary Heilmann.

Instead, Ackermann allowed an instinctive force to guide her hand as it moved across the fields before her.The fluctuation between the screens she populated with diaphanous lines and those carrying weightier, gestural strokes of color also conspired to infuse the paintings with an unexpected rhythm. In ‘Shut Eye’ (2023), for example, two screens brimming with fragments of drawn shapes entice the eye to actively pull open the middle register and thereby show more of the painted forms within. This occurs even as the upper and lower screens seem to press inward, creating a dynamic tension between revelation and concealment. To enhance this impression, Ackermann occasionally used luminous yellow pigment to further instill in these paintings a sense of lightness and transparency.Composed as a sequence of stacked-up semi-translucent frames, these canvases can also be seen as the visual equivalent of images imprinted on a film strip. Ackermann, in fact, draws parallels between the transformative essence of the images in the ‘Splits’ and the dynamic permutations observed when montaged photographic images are projected in a cinema. In both mediums, meaning opens in the infinitesimal split between what the eye sees and the elusive. There, a unique motion also unfolds, one that oscillates between appearance and truth. In all these paintings, there is mystery, one that hints at the presence of the profound and unknowable. Through their enigmatic allure, the ‘Splits’ encourage the viewer to ponder the ineffable, reminding us that while transcendence eludes sight, its essence can nonetheless reveal itself.Splits: Printing | PaintingIn the thick of bringing to canvas the metamorphic forms that would become the ‘Splits,’ Ackermann embarked on a new artistic endeavor, delving into the realm of printmaking. In the resultant seven large-scale silkscreens, which she produced in collaboration with master printer Keigo Takahashi, her concern with making manifest such images became imbued with a related objective: the transformation of paintings into prints, without recourse to the reproduction of a model. Though these silkscreens diverge from the compositional principles of the ‘Splits,’ like them they probe the boundaries of optical perception. To emphasize this, the exhibition includes two recent paintings. One of these—’The Rule of Nature’ (2023)—which belongs to the ‘Splits,’ even bears the marks of Ackermann’s concern with combining monotype printing with painting. Viewers who perceive that will nevertheless find it difficult to distinguish between the look of the other painting—’Misfit’ (2023)—and the silkscreens.This visual feat owes just as much to the artist’s decision to approach the making of these silkscreens as though she were working on a canvas, as to any sleight of the hand enabled by their production. Ackermann began by layering drawings onto paper and then gradually superimposed gestural brush strokes, color stains and delicate droplets of pigment onto the underlying drawings, welcoming the occurrence of accidents through this process. This not only made the contrast between emerging and disappearing forms integral to many of her paintings visible, but also conveyed a sense of the centrifugal motion that frequently ensues in them. As such, those who contemplate these first silkscreens by the artist may well find themselves questioning whether the alleged split between printmaking and painting is, in fact, purely theoretical.About the artistBorn in Budapest, Hungary, in 1968, Rita Ackermann currently lives and works in New York.Ackermann’s recent solo exhibitions include: ‘Hidden,’ MASI Lugano, Switzerland (2023); ‘Vertical Vanish,’ Hauser & Wirth Downtown Los Angeles (2023); ‘Mama ‘19,’ Hauser & Wirth New York, 22nd Street (2020); ‘Brother Sister,’ Hauser & Wirth Zurich, Switzerland (2019); ‘Movements as Monuments,’ La Triennale di Milano, Italy (2018); ‘Turning Air Blue,’ Hauser & Wirth Somerset, England (2017); ‘KLINE RAPE,’ Hauser & Wirth New York, 22nd Street (2016); ‘The Aesthetic of Disappearance,’ Malmö Konsthall, Malmo, Sweden (2016); ‘Chalkboard Paintings,’ Hauser & Wirth Zurich, Switzerland (2015); ‘MEDITATION ON VIOLENCE-HAIR WASH,’ Sammlung Friedrichshof, Burgenland, Austria and Sammlung Friedrichshof Stadtraum, Vienna, Austria (2014); ‘Negative Muscle,’ Hauser & Wirth New York, 69th Street (2013); ‘Fire by Days,’ Hauser & Wirth London, Piccadilly (2012); the Museum of Contemporary Art, Miami FL (2012); ‘Bakos,’ Ludwig Museum, Budapest, Hungary (2011); and ‘Rita Ackermann and Harmony Korine: ShadowFux,’ Swiss Institute, New York NY (2010).",Rita Ackermann.

The first presentation of this work not only marked Genzken’s inaugural show with the gallery but also captured a specific moment in time. Working in Berlin and in New York at the turn of the century, the artist witnessed the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent changing landscape of the city, as well as the collapse of the World Trade Center in New York City. In parallel, from the late 1990s on, the artist’s sculptural works moved towards assembled installations that borrowed their aesthetic from collages, combining objects with variations in scale. The work on view exemplifies this new artistic language, characterised by its engagement with architectural form and its social dimension. Through the combination of materials sourced for purpose, this multifaceted installation contains layered references and takes on new meaning in today’s landscape.About the exhibitionThe installation’s starting point came from the artist’s fascination with the ‘Wasserspeier’ (gargoyles) on Cologne Cathedral, encountering their restoration in the building’s masonry shop. Having tried to convince the cathedral’s master builder to let her take the carvings to London, the artist instead created her own gargoyles for the exhibition in 2004, setting them in dialogue with winged, angelic figures. The duality between the earthbound and the heavenly has permeated Genzken’s career, reflected in her formal vocabulary through materials associated with engineering and heaviness, such as electric cables, aluminum panels and trollies, in addition to objects evoking the sky, light and wind, from blue sheets to bright lamps and umbrellas.Historically, carved gargoyles were provisions for preservation, designed to direct rainwater away from the building, as well as for protection, banishing demons by holding up a mirror to evil. Bringing them from the roof to eye level, Genzken’s gargoyles, instead, confront viewers and humanity at large. In the same way that some gargoyles depict a hybrid of animals with human features, the artist imparts an anthropomorphic quality to her figures by giving them heads and body-like frames. Two figures even wear Genzken’s own clothing, a jacket and cap, lending the work an autobiographical undertone whilst also offering a reminder of civilisation.The four ‘Wasserspeier’ on trolleys appear to skate on the aluminium floor, which brings to mind the Chrysler Building’s metal cladding. The shiny material also enables the work to interact with the world around it, both literally through reflections and metaphorically by speaking to geopolitics; as such, the work and the surroundings become one. ‘In an effort not to represent the world but to be part of it— in other words, to be modern—Genzken chose as her raw materials the cheap, shiny, and ubiquitous building blocks of the contemporary urban environment [...]. Working with these real-world materials, she created installations that engaged with the everyday in substance as well as in subject,’ remarks Laura Hoptman, co-curator of ‘Isa Genzken: Retrospective’ (2013 – 2014) at MoMA, New York.Totemic columns and pedestals recur throughout Genzken’s work and are seen here cloaked in blue plastic that alludes to the wings of angels and is reminiscent of the way in which gowns are draped in Leonardo da Vinci’s drawings. Other objects, such as the sacrificial lamb or twigs and broken umbrellas, evoking the power of wind and nature, allow the viewer to relate to the work’s inherently human qualities of fragility and vulnerability, setting Genzken apart from her minimalist predecessors who pursued notions of order and power in their work. The artist’s interplay of objects conjures a place that is free and ethereal whilst making viewers aware of the restrictions and limitations of the real world.",Isa Genzken.

As such, ‘every medium gets expanded and de-specified: a film can turn into a painting, a painting can become a film,’ as remarked by Isabelle Graw, German art historian, educator and publisher of the journal Texte zur Kunst, in a conversation with the artist. Wanting to go beyond normal photography-based film, the infrared images capture a world consisting of colors and energy. Translated onto canvas with oils, the resulting paintings capture both a stylized world and an essence, a feeling, as in ‘STILTS ZOON X2’ (2023). As relayed to Graw, Korine said, ‘I wanted to make paintings that feel like they’re basically alive. I wondered if one can make works and imagery that look like nothing has preceded them? This project is almost closer to a futurist take on visuals, painting and film.’Some paintings, such as ‘Drift XI’ (2023), focus on close-ups of heads, reflecting the importance of details for the artist. In close to mid-range framing, the infrared camera is able to sensitively detect variations in thermal energy, heat, which is then transformed into a more detailed image. Harnessing the aesthetic potential of infrared, Korine explains ‘the closer you get, the more heat is pulled from the image and the more alive it looks.’ The resulting paintings evoke a visceral reaction in which viewers can visualize and almost feel heat from the body, an immersive experience that Korine describes as ‘close to the idea of being inside of a video game’. The technological workings of the camera mean that, within wide shots, lines are softened and the figures’ features are de-emphasized. The further away from objects, the more impressionistic the image, producing an unearthly quality. Korine comments that ‘The colors and the grain structure start to explode the whole idea of lines. They become more about depicting the vibration of the energy.’The artist spent time mixing paints to intensify the strength and luminosity of the pigments, seeing how far he could push paint, the film and the idea of energy. With influences ranging from Martin Kippenberger’s playful paintings to William Eggleston’s vibrant photographs, Korine’s eccentric color palette of blues, greens, pinks and oranges—dictated by the infrared imagery—not only heightens the sense of liveliness but also the element of science fiction. ‘REVELATOR MAXIMUS’ (2023) shows a walking figure, its surroundings marked by overwhelming monochromatic hues. Variations in shade are important here, from teal to cobalt, forming an unnatural yet ethereal environment. For the artist, ‘the colors are so full of life [...] At the same time the subject matter and the characters are so grim and dystopian so there’s this interesting discourse between the two.’ Compelled to tell a story with his films, Korine’s paintings offer a more immediate encounter with his fantastical world, their subject matter borne from color and energy.",Harmony Korine.

While driving around Los Angeles in 1998, Rhoades explains the relationship of cars to his art (parking is equated with sitting in a sculpture) and to daily practice (driving between the house, the studio and stores is time and space for the mind to race and wander). He expounds on cars as icons of art history (Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia speeded modern art forward with their mechanized abstractions), identifiers of class (you are what you drive) and environments of control. The radio is tuned to Power 106 FM and as the world streams by to the propulsive hip-hop beat, the romance of cars seems irresistible.In April, the installation will be reconfigured to accommodate a lounge and become The Pit. An influx of archival materials will be key to unpacking the various episodes of Rhoades’ Car Projects, starting with the Caprice and the 1996 exhibition ‘Traffic.’ Not only did the artist cut a deal with CAPC musée d’art contemporain de Bordeaux, France the organizers of the show, to go in on buying him the car as a transactional work of art, he later leveraged its symbolic value by trading the Caprice for a Ferrari.This summer the exhibition’s focus will swerve onto The Racetrack. A set of half-scale NASCAR-style cars, custom jackets and colorfully painted tire barriers are among what remains of ‘The Snowball.’ Staged in California as a daylong racing event at Willow Springs speedway, ‘The Snowball’ was ultimately destined for the 2000 Venice Biennale and Rhoades’ collaborative work for the Danish Pavilion. In September, The Garage will cover the final stretch of ‘DRIVE’ with a selection of framed works on paper and a major sculptural installation.Throughout the year, the line-up for ‘DRIVE’ will feature a range of public programs. A film series centered on cars and the city of Los Angeles will be curated by film historian and critic Elvis Mitchell. A theatrical staging of the playwright Charles Mee’s ‘Under Construction,’ which was inspired by Rhoades’ art in its collage depiction of America today, will be presented as part of Hauser & Wirth’s Performance Project.Organized as an investigation in real time, ‘DRIVE’ invites people to approach the exhibition like a garage of art and ideas, in which cars are coming and going and tinkering is a productive state of mind. As an artist, Rhoades was keenly attuned to sources of cultural power and weakness. When he put the internal combustion engine on art’s pedestal, was he presciently placing the car where it belongs for a greener tomorrow?

Accompanying the exhibition is an Education Lab, developed in partnership with Chillida Leku and the NGO Menorca Preservation via its project Plastic Free Menorca.Eduardo Chillida (1924 – 2002) is one of the preeminent Spanish sculptors of the 20th century, whose varied and pioneering practice reinterpreted the dialectic of solid and void, positive and negative and interior and exterior space. Chillida’s connection with Menorca formed during the many summers he spent on the island from 1989. Setting up an outdoor studio at ‘Quatre Vents’, the family house he created with his wife Pilar Belzunce in Alcaufar, he found a quiet place to work on chamotte clay sculptures, surrounded by the fields and their dry-stone walls. At ‘Quatre Vents’, he also worked in a studio with a large window overlooking the sea, where he explored many of his ‘gravitations’.In Menorca, Chillida drew inspiration from the white light of the Mediterranean that was a perfect contrast to the ‘black light’ of his native Basque Country, as he described it. He held an enduring admiration for the light, the open-air quarries of local ‘marès’ stone and the monuments from the Talayotic period, including T-shaped ‘taules’ (‘tables’ in Catalan) which inspired some of his works and have been recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2023. He commented: ‘The light in Menorca is magnificent. The island has a beautiful history, there is a very interesting stone culture, and it’s so full of wind. So, I have heard it said: Menorca, wind and stones.’The exhibition opens with a series of large format ‘gravitations’, two-dimensional works on paper exploring the qualities and limitations of space. These delicate black and white works result from cutting various layers of paper, attaching them to threads and then suspending them to allow air to circulate between them. Alongside the ‘gravitations’ is ‘Mural G-56’ (1985), a large-scale mural which uses black graphic elements to draw from the same exploration between positive and negative space. In Chillida’s own words, ‘in most of my sculptures, the positives and negatives alternate. Each one is somehow reciprocal, the dissentient of the other’.‘Chillida in Menorca’ showcases a series of well-known steel sculptures and wood reliefs, emphasising Chillida’s interest in making space visible through the forms around it. Initially a student of architecture, Chillida explored concepts such as the limit, space and scale. In ‘Proyecto para un monumento’ (Project for a Monument)’ (1969), a play on scale linking to the artist’s many public monuments, interior space is shaped through three solid blocks that fit together. In other works, totemic elements of an intimate human scale continue to emphasise the interplay between solid forms and negative space.Throughout the exhibition, a selection of works are presented on plinths made from ‘marès’, the local stone used to build the 18th century building housing the gallery. The presentation concept has been developed by architect Luis Laplace, who led the restoration of Hauser & Wirth Menorca and the reconditioning at Chillida Leku – the museum created by Eduardo Chillida in his lifetime – and places the artworks in dialogue with the surrounding landscape and the architecture of the space.Alongside materiality, the act of making was a crucial concept in Chillida’s work. The hand was the artist’s closest subject and his most immediate tool to work graphically or sculpturally – it stood for everything handmade. Rejecting moulds, he embraced the irregular morphology of works created by the direct manipulation with his hands, such as the chamotte clay sculptures he worked on in his Menorca studio. These are presented alongside drawings featuring the hand, in which he found a living element to investigate space through the movement of the fingers, which open and close in an attempt to grasp their surroundings.In Menorca, Chillida modelled many of his ‘Lurra’ sculptures —a series named after the word ‘earth’ in Basque. They are made from chamotte clay, a type of clay which can be fired in large blocks without breaking. Chillida was attracted to this property of the material and explored the endless possibilities of shapes that it allowed for.In works such as ‘Lurra M-32 (Earth M-32)’ (1996), fine incisions reveal patterns of straight and circular shapes. In other pieces such as ‘Lurra M-13 (Earth M-13)’ (1995), the incisions would penetrate in such a way to reveal the interior space and impart a sensation of buoyancy. The titles link the works back to their place of origin: those with an ‘M’ in their title are among those made in the Menorca studio, while those with a ‘G’ were made in Grasse, in the south of France, where Chillida became acquainted with the material.Also made from chamotte clay are a series of ‘Óxidos (Oxides)’, which acquired a distinct colour and texture through the use of black copper oxide and the double firing process. As in ‘Mural G-56’, ‘Óxido G-78’ (1985) features abstract geometric motifs, which correlate with his abstract ink drawings and are painted on both sides of the work, inviting the viewer to experience the sense of space created with it.The final galleries in the exhibition foreground the artist’s passion for natural phenomena. He incorporated organic shapes in his early works on paper and steel sculptures and emphasised the natural qualities of the materials he worked with such as granite, alabaster and felt, amongst others. An example of this is the granite piece ‘Escuchando a la piedra III (Listening to the Stone III)’ (1996), in which the artist removed just enough material to reveal the form and emphasise the rock’s impenetrability. Similarly, exploring the versatility of steel, the sculpture ‘Lotura XXVII (Bond XXVII)’ (1992) is composed of longitudinal arms created in the forge, without moulds, and manipulated to open up and then wrap back into themselves, quietly inhabiting the space with a tree-like quality.Having grown up by the Atlantic Ocean, Chillida recalled spending hours contemplating the waves and referred to the sea as his teacher. ‘Homenaje a la mar IV’ (Homage to the Sea IV)’ (1998), from the series of tributes which Chillida dedicated to figures or phenomena that inspired him, evokes the rugged Cantabrian coastline through geometrical shapes hewn out of alabaster in contrast to an uncut stone base. In dialogue with this sculpture is ‘Homenaje a la arquitectura II (Homage to Architecture II)’ (2000), a reference to Chillida’s ongoing exploration of forms – whether organic or architectural – and their structuring in space.Placed in dialogue with the Mediterranean Sea is ‘Proyecto Peine del viento I (Comb of the Wind Project I)’ (1966). The study is part of the artist’s most important series of work, culminating with three colossal steel sculptures embedded in the rocks on the seashore of San Sebastián, a work which fuses materials, land, sea, and air. With its tentacular arms embracing the dynamism of the elements, the work is an invitation to look.",Chillida in Menorca,"Isla del Rey (Illa del Rei), Menorca, Balearic Islands,",Daily 10am-5pm, 11 May  - 27 Oct 2024  
Hauser & Wirth Menorca,Mahón,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/roni-horn-7/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Roni Horn,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/roni-horn/,"The acclaimed New York-based artist Roni Horn, awarded the Joan Miró Prize in 2013 and known for her conceptually oriented work in diverse media, presents her first solo exhibition in Menorca, featuring a selection of sculptures and installations that interact with the historical gallery spaces and natural surroundings. Although varied in medium, all works derive from longstanding themes that have propelled Horn’s ongoing poetic study on the protean nature of identity, meaning and perception. An ambitious installation of solid cast glass sculptures invites visitors to witness the interplay between light and weather in the South Galleries. Additionally, the exhibition features pieces inspired by the verses of Emily Dickinson and works in gold and copper from important series which the artist has worked on since the 1990s.At the heart of the exhibition lies ‘Untitled (“A witch is more lovely than thought in the mountain rain.”)’, a compelling collection of nine round sculptures made from solid cast glass. Horn started exploring and working on cast-glass sculptures in the mid-1990s, with a process consisting of pouring coloured molten glass into a mould, which gradually hardens over the course of several months. The resulting sculpture is highly textural: its sides are rough with the impression of the mould in which it was cast, while its fire-polished top is smooth and glossy, resembling a crystalline pool of water.Horn has said about the cast-glass sculptures, ‘what fascinates me has a lot to do with the essence of something that has one appearance but is really something completely different.’ The sculptures appear to be in a constant state of change, responding to nature through the skylights and windows and the presence of visitors in the architectural space. Gradations of sunlight and shadow activate the works, creating a dialogue between solidity and fluidity, opacity and transparency. In this way, Horn’s glass sculptures embody the heart of her practice: probing the relationship between mutability and place.Uncertainty and ambiguity permeate Horn’s work, evident in the seemingly watery surface of the cast-glass sculptures as well as in ‘Black Asphere’, a solid copper work which appears to the eye as a ball or ‘a sphere’. The term ‘asphere’ refers to the fact that it is not symmetrical in one axis. Horn has described the work as ‘a self-portrait’, linked to the artist’s experience of androgyny and resistance to binary labels.Duality serves as another thematic tool explored through Horn’s investigations of ambiguity and paradox, as seen in the ‘Pair Objects’ series in copper and stainless steel as well as ‘a.k.a’, which features paired portraits of the artist through time. In these, the pairing of potentially identical objects delves into the complexities of identity and unity, difference and duplication. In the Menorca exhibition, the pure gold sculpture ‘Double Mobius, v. 2’, presents two ribbons in the form of a Möbius strip, a geometrical form that appears to be two sided, but only has one side. The piece strips away the layers of cultural significance associated with gold and allows visitors to experience the actual material, in the shape of a strip denoting both intimacy and infinity.Literature plays an important role in Horn’s practice and the artist makes literary references both in work titles as well in the works themselves. Whereas the multi-part glass installation is titled ‘A witch is more lovely than thought in the mountain rain’ after a poem by Joan Murray, three sculptures from Horn’s ‘Key and Cue’ series feature the first lines of poems by Emily Dickinson, to whom Horn has dedicated various bodies of work.In the series ‘Key and Cue,’ Horn uses the verses as self-contained statements across the four faces of the bar, refusing to be seen or read all at once. In these pieces, Horn renders the text as images, encouraging us to think about language as sculpture, and hence removed from its meaning. As Horn said, ‘I don’t think of the object, the material thing or what is produced as the endpoint of a work. The aspiration is always the experience, which means the audience, the individual, is integral to the value of the work.’",Roni Horn,"Isla del Rey (Illa del Rei), Menorca, Balearic Islands,",Daily 10am-5pm, 11 May  - 27 Oct 2024

In surreal and fragmentary scenes, Otero mines his personal history to make sense of the current moment, animating everyday objects and environments that are loosely based on the domestic spaces of his youth.While Otero is best known as a painter, his exhibition at Hauser & Wirth marks the artist’s return to sculpture. Combining ceramics with welded metal, three new sculptural works on view evoke the mutable landscapes of childhood remembered. Their subject matter consists of identifiable objects that undergo transformation and reconstruction, creating uncanny new contexts.

A meditation on meaning, Horn’s unique process of taking things apart and putting them back together anew tests the limits of draftsmanship by exploring its sculptural potential. For her latest series, titled ‘Slarips’ (the word ‘spirals’ written in reverse), Horn began by making watercolor spirals in an array of hues. She then cut up the painted images and collaged them together into new tessellated compositions. Each is titled with a deliberate misspelling of the word ‘spirals,’ signaling a profound departure from the work’s original source material.Horn is an avid reader, and as much a writer as she is a visual artist. Words naturally permeate her practice. In this exhibition, her use of language pertains to the works’ titles, which act as entrance rather than explanation. Horn’s wordplay also figures in the sculptures on view: the titles of the six luminous cast-glass forms feature quotes from novels, films and radio broadcasts. These shallow tapered circular forms––a new shape in Horn’s ongoing glass works––are infused with a singular color drawn from a palette of whites, blacks and blues. As daylight pours in from the skylights, moving across the gallery and changing temperature over the course of the day, the saturation and transparency of the colors likewise shift. The subtle effects of varying light, combined with viewers’ movements in the room, activate these works, which defy any fixed reading.The artist began making cast-glass sculptures in the mid-1990s, pouring colored molten glass into molds that would then gradually anneal over the course of several months. Horn spent years developing a specific technical process that furnishes her finished works with a nearly alchemical quality: they appear simultaneously fluid and solid. Visually ambiguous, their opaque, roughly textured sides bear impressions of the molds in which they were cast, while their glossy, fire-polished tops recall the crystal-clear surface of an undisturbed pool of water. Water, often considered a universal symbol for change, is a constant theme for Horn, once stating she is ‘...fascinated by this idea of water as a form of perpetual relation, not so much a substance but a thing whose identity was based on its relation to other things.... Rather than an object, water becomes a metaphor for consciousness—of time, of physicality, of the human condition.’About the artistRoni Horn’s approach consistently generates uncertainty to thwart closure in her work. Important across her oeuvre is her longstanding interest to the protean nature of identity, meaning and perception, as well as the notion of doubling; issues which continue to propel Horn’s practice.This spring, Horn’s work will be presented in the following solo exhibitions: ‘Roni Horn. Give Me Paradox or Give Me Death,’ at Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany (23 March – 11 August); ‘Roni Horn. The Detour of Identity,’ at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebæk, Denmark (2 May – 1 September); and at Hauser & Wirth Menorca (11 May – 27 October).Recent exhibitions include ‘Roni Horn: A dream dreamt in a dreaming world is not really a dream... but a dream not dreamt is’ at He Art Museum, Shunde, China (2023); ‘Roni Horn: I am paralyzed with hope,’ Centro Botín, Santander, Spain (2022); ‘Félix González-Torres / Roni Horn’, Bourse de Commerce - Pinault Collection, Paris, France (2022); ‘Roni Horn: When You See Your Reflection in Water, Do You Recognize the Water in You?,’ Pola Museum, Hakone, Japan (2021 – 2022); ‘Roni Horn.

Baghramian’s geometric shapes and organic forms, invariably made from cast aluminum and held or supported by armatures, hooks and rods, rather confront their beholders with subtle evocations of poses and postures, demeanors and dispositions. Placed at the margins or dangling from the ceiling of the exhibition space, these sculptures, as they appear to withdraw, stand up or recline (as in her 2023 outdoor work ‘S’adossant (Pauline),’ currently on view at MoMA in New York), poignantly evoke both the social strictures and potential mutability of embodiment, thereby offering striking allegories—or models—of contemporary subject positions.Intensifying her preceding interrogation of the poetics and politics of representing and addressing the human figure, the syntax and placement of her new works—all of which conjure bent or bowed bodies (as suggested by the title addition ‘se ployant’)—starts from the double meaning of the term ‘mass.’ Aligning a central facet of any sculpture, ‘mass’ is palpable even when it is absent or negated. In this new body of work, the artist questions the pressures (figuratively or literally) exerted on the individual elements of any given group arrangement (be it social or artistic, or both). In this way, Baghramian’s abstract works intend to explore the interstices between conforming and retreating and the space of leeway they may offer for perception, critique and reflection.",Nairy Baghramian.

When the late work was first shown at the Marlborough Gallery in 1970, critics denounced Guston’s dramatic shift from abstraction toward dark, cartoon-like imagery. Today, the paintings of Guston’s last years are considered milestones of modern art. Well-known paintings will be featured alongside never-before exhibited works.

Shown alongside the publicly owned Curled Nude on a Stool (1982-83), the works bring to light an integral element of Uglow’s practice: the nude as an essentially formal problem.Landscapes emerging from Uglow’s ‘pilgrimages’ to the Mediterranean attest to his unwavering pursuit of clarity, sensibility for luminous planes of light, and accomplished control over forms, as fastidiously devised as in his portraits and still lifes.The exhibition catalogue is comprised of essays by Catherine Lampert and Andrew Lambirth.

On the surface – and what surfaces they are! – her works may seem to be about nature. They are perfect specimens of craft, that most human of phenomena, probed to its deepest root.”In her sculptures of botanical forms, Nielsen applies handmade glazes with an airbrush. Encased within the sheen of a gloss glaze overcoat, their lustrous surfaces hint at artifice and the decorative arts, enacting a metamorphosis: “A trivial thing is transformed into an icon for contemplation,” Adamson continues. A broad hosta leaf, for example, reads like a signboard with two sprays can blasts of red and yellow pigment; another leaf, its scale exaggerated, becomes an elliptical shield. A wall of plant specimens seems to sway, shift, and demarcate space as if runic letters in an ancient alphabet.Meanwhile, Nielsen’s three-dimensional sculptures capture intricate renditions of the small minutiae of nature: the slight rustle of a sprig of bamboo under a gust of air, the momentary claw-like gesture of a drooping chestnut branch, a rhododendron bush hammered by a downpour’s tattoo, or the tension drawn close to breaking of a bundle of twigs sutured by the gossamer of an overnight spiderweb. Regardless of its source—which often feels so familiar—Nielsen captures the moments in which nature asks us to look again, absent of the straightforward cultural readings of its forms. The symbolism of an oak tree, bamboo leaf, or chestnut branch is returned to their wilder engagements.In evoking the ephemeral forms and arrangements of overgrown spaces, Nielsen directs us to the still-life genre and its ability to crystalize the transient and fleeting. The artist isolates botanical scenarios and chance compositions from fields and forests through the slow and detailed observation of her surroundings. As Adamson writes, “This dynamic is exactly what’s at stake in Nielsen’s artifice. It is an elaboration of the simple idea that acts of looking are already transformative, and potentially destructive. She slows that process way down, almost to a dead stop, the better for us to feel its vast implications.”","Marianne Nielsen: Leaf, stem, twig","381 Broadway, NY 10013",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 3 May  - 15 Jun 2024

An example of their recent work, The Aviator (after Antonella da Messina), evokes Russian iconography while incorporating a backdrop reminiscent of expressionists like Kandinsky and Chagall.Alan Feltus is an artist who paints spontaneously without prior plans as to his final composition. The Black Dress is an example of his preference for female figures, and illustrates the sculptural quality of his work, which is inspired by classical Greek sculptures and early Renaissance art.An American realist painter, Bo Bartlett amplifies ordinary moments in human life, making them extraordinary. His paintings are dreamlike narratives, suggesting complex layers of conscious and unconscious meaning. In Fugue, he invites us to contemplate a quietly enigmatic seated woman.Ioanna Stefou paints sensitive yet highly realistic portraits of girls and women, and, in contrast, powerful seascapes of the ocean surrounding her native Greece. Archontia combines the two, picturing a bathing-suited woman at rest in the shallow ripples of Aegean coastal waters.Ben Whitehouse combines the landscape tradition of his native Britain with awe for the American countryside, and for the spiritual in art and in nature. His intense concern for the environment can be seen in River, Botanical Gardens, Glencoe, Illinois, where he offers viewers the opportunity to contemplate their relationship to nature.Also inspired by his surroundings, John Evans creates loosely abstracted landscapes as illustrated in the painting, Beach Parking.

Ratcliff’s books include Lee Krasner: The Unacknowledged Equal (2020), Andy Warhol: Portraits (2007), Lynda Benglis: Soft Off (2002), and The Fate of a Gesture: Jackson Pollock and Postwar American Art (1996).Over the course of a seventy-year-long career, New York-based Argentine-American artist Raquel Rabinovich (b. 1929, Buenos Aires) has been concerned with the paradox of making the invisible visible. Her interest in mythology, existence, poetry, nature, and transcendence is reflected in her monochromatic paintings and drawings, as well as in her sculptural practice that encompasses large-scale glass environments and site-specific stone installations along the shores of the Hudson River. Exploring a range of material choices and artistic processes, Rabinovich’s work seeks to convey “that which is concealed emerging into view.”As a part of Rabinovich’s lifelong investigation into the “dark source,” the Avatars series allows her to represent the dark as neither negative nor absent, but as a rich realm of knowledge and wisdom. Each subsequent body of work continues that investigation while attempting to access the “concealed aspects of existence which lie behind the appearance of things, thoughts, language, and the world.”Rabinovich’s work has been featured in national and international exhibitions, such as at the Americas Society, New York; The Bronx Museum of the Arts, New York; Fundación Alón para las Artes, Buenos Aires; Jewish Museum, New York; MoMA P.S. 1, New York; and El Museo del Barrio, New York.

The works in this series are set at dusk, twilight, and deep night—hours that become vehicles for ritual and interiority. The silhouetted inhabitants of this in-between realm are archetypes that Brackens once described as ciphers, or “needles through which I slip the threads of biography and myth, and pass through a mesh of history and context.”His figures are accompanied by an ecosystem of symbols and shapes that have recurred over the course of his practice. The animals, natural elements, and man-made objects, accrue significance every time they are cast in this ever-evolving mythology. The characters in this series are placed in dialogue with lightning bolts, waning suns, and sourceless orbs of light—open-ended devices of orientation. In these distilled arrangements, footholds for straightforward interpretation dissolve—inviting viewers to parse the compositions and uncover meaning.Brackens’ semiotic language emerges from lived experience, but also through revisiting books, poems, and legends. In blood compass, some of these references—alluded to in his titles— include the novel Mind of My Mind by Octavia Butler, the poem “How you might approach a foal” by Wendy Videlock, and the Bible’s parable of the prodigal son. These stories, though dramatically diverse in genre and subject, speak to Brackens’ inclination to loop, lose, and locate one’s self in that which is known, but also to shape-shift, forming new meaning from that which is “familiar.” He approaches these symbols—weighted with memory, context, and history—with fresh eyes or, as Videlock’s poem concludes, ”like you / are new to the world.”Diedrick Brackens (b. 1989, Mexia, TX; lives and works in Los Angeles, CA) is best known for his woven tapestries that explore allegory and narrative through the artist’s autobiography, broader themes of African American and queer identity, as well as American history. Brackens employs techniques from West African weaving, quilting from the American South and European tapestry-making to create both abstract and figurative works. Often depicting moments of male tenderness, Brackens culls from African and African American literature, poetry and folklore as source. Beginning his process through the hand-dyeing of cotton, a material he deliberately uses in acknowledgement of its brutal history, Brackens’ oeuvre presents rich, nuanced visions of African American life and identity, while also alluding to the complicated histories of labor and migration. Brackens utilizes both commercial dyes and atypical pigments such as wine, tea and bleach to create his vibrant, intricately-woven tapestries that investigate historical gaps, interlacing the present with his singular magical realist worldview. Brackens’ scenes intentionally lack any sort of moralizing tone, allowing his subjects the freedom of living life on their terms.

His allegorical and autobiographical compositions explore themes of Black masculinity, fatherhood, legacy, and remembrance, complicating and subverting visual stereotypes and misrepresentations. Often working from archival family photographs, Gibbs creates tender, emotionally evocative vignettes that highlight moments of quiet joy and sorrow, rest, and mundane beauty while engaging deeply with the materiality of his process.The inspiration for the body of work in this exhibition came from the artist’s viewing of the 1977 Ralph Nelson film A Hero Ain’t Nothin’ but a Sandwich, which centers on the struggles of a young boy in South Central Los Angeles following the abandonment of his biological father. This film sparked a period of self-examination and painterly exploration for Gibbs, bringing to the surface his own experience of losing his father at a young age. For Gibbs, the canvas becomes a space within which he can parse the gaps and ruptures of personal memory to create works that provide portals into universal human emotional experiences.While the figures that populate Gibbs’ paintings are often drawn from personal life, he situates them within domestic interiors and fictive nonspaces that create cinematic moments of narrative ambiguity. Building up his surfaces in a process of accumulative brushstrokes, the artist imbues his scenes with a mixture of the familiar and the imaginative. Windows and mirrors frequently appear in his work, as both a metaphoric invocation of the variable experience of memory and a device to allow the artist to manipulate multidirectional light sources with painterly finesse. In My worst fear is…tragedy on news, 2024, a mirror’s reflection casts a familiar scene of family gathered on the couch in front of the television into a realm of slightly destabilizing distortion, suggesting the jarring impact of what might be unfolding before them in primetime.In this new body of work, Gibbs has begun experimenting with compositional disruptions that reinforce the psychological interiority of his figures. In Like father like son, 2024, a small canvas depicting the artist as a young child is affixed to a portrait of his father. Head bowed in profile as he listens to music on headphones, his beloved record collection surrounds him. This use of separate surfaces highlights the distance between the father who is gone and the son who has remained. Yet the color relationships across the two canvases suggest that, for the artist, music–like painting– can function as a bridge or point of connection across time and loss. In Inheritance, 2024, Gibbs depicts his father as a young man new to fatherhood and filled with its attendant joys, holding his infant son. A black void eclipses the child’s face. The artist notes, “This void is my own experience of the moment, which I only experience as a photograph.” The painting becomes a way to both pay intimate tribute to his father’s visible joy and to grapple with, on a broader level, what it means to build an identity as a father and a man when the memory of those who came before you is incomplete.What happens when the dream falls apart, 2024, and Two peas in a pod, 2024, introduce new physical material into the artist’s oeuvre. Gibbs limns these figures with flattened appliques of imitation gold leaf, transforming contemporary family portraits into 21st century icons that build upon the rich art historical tradition of illuminated divinity. The artist’s choice of imitation gold leaf is significant, functioning as a metaphor for the resourcefulness with which his family and his community in Baltimore have repeatedly built and rebuilt their lives with what little they had and were given.Jerrell Gibbs (b. 1988; Baltimore, Maryland) graduated with an MFA from the Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, in 2020. He has been the subject of solo exhibitions at Mariane Ibrahim, Chicago, and Paris; and featured in exhibitions at the Reginald F.

His first solo museum exhibition, No Solace in the Shade, will be on view at the Brandywine Museum of Art from September 27, 2025, through March 1, 2026, following the institution’s recent acquisition of a landmark painting by Gibbs.

From then on, natural energy sources (the wind, water, light, gravity), their beauty and unpredictability, would be at the heart of his creative process.Thanks to a series of decisive encounters, Susumu Shingu gradually developed his sculptural vocabulary, imbued with poetry and technicality, contemplation and humanism. Striving for ever greater lightness and harmony with nature, the artist develops his materials over time. Marvelling at the infinite variation of natural forms, Susumu Shingu has never ceased to gather precious lessons from them, attempting to give form to the elusive, to the depth and fleeting nature of the universal breath.The natural world around me is a constant source of inspiration in all its varied movements, and I still draw on it today for ever new principles. The more I observe nature, the greater my joy, and when the finished work comes to life, connected to the energies of nature, I see it as the birth of new life, and it is then that my joy reaches its fullness. This Earth – our planet – is for me a home full of mysterious charms where I find inexhaustible treasures for my creation.– Susumu ShinguLa Caravane du Vent, created in 2000, took 21 sculptures to 6 places around the world, chosen by the artist for their emblematic winds, extreme climates, unspoilt nature and unspoilt populations: the rice fields of Sanda in Japan (June 2000), the uninhabited island of Motukorea in New Zealand (November 2000), the rocky desert of Tamdaght in Morocco (April 2001), the green steppe of Undur Dov in Mongolia (June 2001), and the dunes of Cumbuco in Brazil (November 2001). During this year-long journey, the artist and his wife explored the planet among the Maoris, the Mongols, the Sami, the Berbers…In 2006, the gallery dedicated its first exhibition to the artist, Sculptures du respir, followed in 2009 by Planet of Wind and Water, in which the artist presented a model of his project Breathing Earth, a self-sufficient village powered by the natural energies of wind, water and sun; a place of inspiration, exchange and creation for artists, scientists and children… This project was the subject of the film Breathing Earth – Susumu Shingu’s Dream, by director Thomas Riedelsheimer, whom first came to the gallery in 2006.Whether intended for interior or exterior spaces, Susumu Shingu’s work it is at once profoundly terrestrial and human, as well as in constant rotation in the Void, like an unfolding Galaxy. Earthly, because of the variety of shapes, colours and movements that characterise them and in which our planet abounds; human, because of the particular charm that they embody, giving each of them a specific android character. Galactic, because their grace and slow, precise movement play with the orbits of air, water and light, giving us a sense of the infinitesimal measure of Space-Time. Playing with gravity and driven by the breath of the elements that provide their choreography, these sculptures unfold in perfect balance and osmosis between Matter and Void, like technological spaceships seeking to enter into a profound dialogue with Mother Nature.– Véronique Jaeger, Vaisseaux terrestres, in the exhibition catalogue for Spaceship by Susumu Shingu, Mudam Luxembourg, 2018-2019Following on from the 2012 exhibition Au-delà du Temps at the gallery and as part of the FIAC Hors les Murs programme, his work Sinfonietta of Light, an aerial ballet of ten pairs of wings animated by water and wind, was installed in the large octagonal basin of the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris. In 2014, his Wind Museum was inaugurated in Sanda’s Arimafuji Park in Japan, a true natural setting where the artist lives and works, between Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto. Twelve of his sculptures are installed there, including the emblematic Satoyama windmill sculpture. In 2018, the Cosmos exhibition was held at the gallery in conjunction with the exhibition Spaceship at Mudam Luxembourg, which honoured this world-renowned artist with his first exhibition in Europe featuring some fifteen works, including La Caravane du Vent.In 2019, to mark the 500th anniversary of Leonardo da Vinci’s death and the start of construction of the Chambord castle, a major exhibition initiated by the gallery was devoted to him at the Domaine national de Chambord: Susumu Shingu, une utopie pour aujourd’hui.Chambord is not only made of stone, but it is also of air. The stone breathes and is reflected in the water. Everything is still except for the reflections. And then Shingu creates movement. With his sculptures in water and wind as mysterious and light as the silhouette of the castle.– Renzo PianoThe ecological dimension of his creations finds a perfect echo in an area entirely dedicated to nature; like Da Vinci, Susumu Shingu is inspired by the question of flow and perpetual movement. He makes numerous preparatory drawings and sketches. Like those of the Florentine master, they show a great attention to detail, to form and material, and an essential dreamlike dimension. The exhibition also includes Susumu Shingu’s most important work: Atelier Earth, a model of the utopian village he designed, powered by natural energy. An artistic and cultural centre, this village is designed in part for children, allowing them to discover art through their five senses. “A place where we can reflect on the future of the Earth, in collaboration with artists, musicians, writers, academics, philosophers, engineers and scientists from all over the world,” writes Shingu. This dream project, which the artist has been developing for years, will be inaugurated in 2024-2025 in Arimafuji Park, which already houses his Wind Museum.Susumu Shingu doesn’t limit himself to a single field of artistic expression, he also explores the world of theatrical creation: in the 90s, he wrote and directed a theatre piece, Kippis and his friends, which takes place around his Water Tree. The play tells the story of extraterrestrials who discover Earth and question the meaning of human presence. The artist is also known for his many works for children, published by Gallimard Jeunesse. Reflecting deep inspirations found in nature, these books, sometimes created in the voice of his puppet alter ego, Sandalino, are veritable invitations to travel.Shingu’s artistic career has been marked by frequent collaborations with renowned designers such as Issey Miyake, Jiří Kylián, Tadao Ando and, above all, Renzo Piano. Over time, a true creative complicity has developed between the two artists: in 2016, three sculptures by Susumu Shingu were installed at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Centre in Athens, designed by Renzo Piano. In October 2021, the architect inaugurated a residential tower with panoramic views overlooking the Hudson River in the Soho district of New York with a new sculpture by Susumu Shingu, Rainbow Leaves, marking the tenth collaboration between the two. From July to September 2023, the Nakanoshima Art Museum in Osaka paid tribute to the dialogue and friendship between the two artists with an exhibition entitled Parallel Lives.For this exhibition, his fifth at the gallery and his first in France since 2019, Shingu presents four new sculptures. Reflection of Rainbow is undoubtedly the most spectacular: like his large-scale water sculptures, this work is animated by a perpetual movement arranged by the multiple spillages of liquid that set the elements of the sculpture in motion, in a mechanism that is as precise as it is fluid. This consummate art of combining engineering technique with artistic imagination is reflected in the aerial movements of La Pace, which continues to glorify the luminous face of a world that despite everything, is serene and at peace. For Shingu’s creations neither weigh nor pose, like a bird’s wing evoked in another wind sculpture, Catch and Run, while the Japanese master’s most recent work, Menuet, reminds us that flight is undoubtedly the state closest to dance, and to music… These four new sculptures resonate in the exhibition with a group of older works that are characteristic of the artist’s subtle art: white or yellow aerial effusions, or Petit Bois, made up of graceful stems that sway slightly in the slightest breeze. The exhibition will also be accompanied by drawings, sketches, and studies that illustrate Shingu’s creative process and his unique way of deploying the two-dimensionality of his sketches in space.",Enchan-Temps: Susumu Shingu: Le Souffle d’Ici – L’Eau de là [The Breath of Here – The Water Beyond],"5 rue de Saintonge, 75003",Tue-Sat 10am-7pm, 2 Mar  - 13 Jul 2024

His work represents a continuation of what is known as the Hermannsburg School, a style pioneered by Rex Battarbee and Pareroultja's uncle, the great Albert Namatjira. Although, of course, each exponent of this style has their own visual lexicon, what unites almost all their work is a hybridity of one-point perspective European landscape painting, and the earthbound philosophy of the Arrernte. The resulting aesthetic is luminous and almost hallucinatory in its effect. Shadows are often painted as variations in colour rather than tone, adding to the descriptiveness of the pictures, revealing as it does aspects of the land that would otherwise remain obscure. There is consequently a heightened sense of one's surroundings, as though the artist's brush illuminates more than the naked eye can perceive.Pareroultja paints directly, without preliminary drawings or sketches. Consequently, forms are not always sharply defined, imbuing the paintings with a lucidity and dynamism that mimics the transient nature of the landscape itself. Mountain tops and horizon lines are angled off their axes, and the curve of branches are often accentuated, representational decisions that animate the land and underscore its vitality. A recurring motif is a group of trees in the foreground which, almost anthropomorphically, represent the viewer, or perhaps the artist himself. In a purely formal sense, they contextualise the scale of the landscapes Pareroultja depicts.""Weer Loo"" is what the artist's grandfather called the curlew, a large, ground-dwelling bird endemic to Australia. A field report from Brookton, Western Australia, once noted that their call was heard in response to the cry of possums shot by hunters (Hill, H.E. (1903), Some Notes from Brookton, W.A.). Pareroultja himself states that ""I hear the sound of the curlew at night on my Country, it's part of the Dreamtime story of my outstation, the birds make an unusual sound. They call each other together and celebrate and dance like a sacred ritual and it reminds me of the old Arrernte People who would dance ceremony, which may take the form of a corroboree. So, my London show is a celebration of my work.""This exhibition crystallises the cultural exchange that took place in the early 20th century between non-Indigenous and Indigenous People - ""... both ways..."" as Pareroultja states. Pain and injustice characterised much of this time in Australia's history, as indeed it still does in many respects, but this period also bore witness to great men and women of Aboriginal and European descent, working together and exchanging ideas. If there is something to be triumphant about from this time, and something that perhaps hints at a future of reconciliation, respect and progress, it is that, and the spirit of the Arrernte.",Weer Loo - The Cry Of The Curlew,"24 Howie Street, SW11 4AY",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 29 May  - 13 Jul 2024

Set within a scene of Campbell’s current home, the artist’s three children are situated throughout the house, experiencing the world from different perspectives. However personal, this is not a world removed from our own; the viewer is painted from the balcony and thus called into subjecthood. Cryptic translations of the surrounding landscape into thickly troweled slabs of abstracted paint signal an irrepressible inner world made visible, engaging viscerally and intellectually with the legacies of expressionism, and feminist critique.Symbolism is deftly wielded by Campbell throughout the exhibition, demonstrated by the two portraits Where Have You Been My Blue-Eyed Son? (2023) and In Utero (2023), which voice the polarities of teenage volatility. One depicts a rain-laden poppy, strong and vibrant despite its delicacy. The other is an archetypal image of a teenager, cross-legged in a Nirvana band tee with a face both hopeful and challenging. Each an image of the beguiling energy and tenuous balance of this vulnerable period of life, Campbell expresses tension and growth through the scale of the central figures in relation to their square frames.Los Angeles parallels teenagerhood throughout the exhibition as a place of precarity, excesses, opportunity, fear, and multiple realities. Depicting a scene outside of the city, Hollywood is a Sign (2023) holds an amalgam of illusions and truths stereotypical of L.A. The cerulean pool – an unnatural feature in the desert – offers a rich metaphor for the beauty, spiritualism, and artificiality echoed throughout the painting. In Between (2024) evokes a similar pull between fantasy and reality as two girls, each clothed in a sumptuous red gown (the artist’s own wedding dress), convey curiosity and anxiety in a secluded world overlooking the distant skyline of downtown Los Angeles.The image of an ecstatic and impasto-ed lemon tree in California Love (2023) is another elucidation of the paradoxical nature of L.A. Surrounded by a garden of other flourishing non-native plants, it is an image from the artist’s backyard from a time during the pandemic when the skies were vibrantly hued by the wildfires in Southern California – a beautiful and aberrant sight. The esoteric figures of Wolf Moon (2024) and Wolf Moon II (2024) present an otherworldly experience of a different kind as cryptograms akin to tarot cards. Emblematic of Campbell’s persistent theoretical inquiry into the perceiver / perceived dynamic, the figures are occluded and protected by veil or shadow.“To watch someone is to hold them apart, to see them is to remember them, a piece of yourself.” The eponymous Young Americans paintings engage with and build upon previous series of portraits that Campbell has created throughout her career. The subject of this collection is her children and their friends, the representatives of our future in closely observed vignettes, navigating adolescence in a world of extraordinary uncertainties. Already changed from the time of these portraits, these young Americans each encapsulate the nostalgia, inspiration, unfolding and anticipation of this body of work. Campbell accomplishes a transcendent task in these paintings, demonstrating not only masterful technical prowess but also the ability to convey universal ideas through individual experience.Rebecca Campbell was born in Salt Lake City, Utah and now lives and works in Los Angeles. L.A. Louver has represented the artist since her graduation with an MFA from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2001, presenting six solo exhibitions and featuring her work in over a dozen group exhibitions. Campbell’s work has been seen at Art Basel Switzerland, Art Basel Miami Beach, ARCO Madrid, and ADAA: The Art Show New York and is represented in both private and public collections across North America and Europe including Brigham Young University, Provo, UT; California State University Long Beach, Long Beach, CA; Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR; Laguna Art Museum, Laguna Beach, CA; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, CA; Nora Eccles Museum of Art, Utah State University, Logan, UT; Phoenix Art Museum, Phoenix, AZ; and the Utah Museum of Fine Arts, Salt Lake City, UT.

In their work, human forms assume the silhouettes of mountains, seashells spiral into celestial constellations. Weaving fragments of bodies into landscapes, the works in this show honour the kinship between humans, nature, and the cosmos.The exhibition takes its title from a quote by Luchita Hurtado (1920-2020), the sensational Venezuelan-American artist who dedicated her career to bridging the gap between the self and all other living forms. Her extraordinary artwork presents life from unique perspectives. She turns the viewer’s gaze upwards with her skyscape paintings. She expands the viewer’s soul with depictions of limbs extending into sacred landscapes or standing figures becoming trees in forests. Always in tune with the ever-changing world around her, Hurtado’s work illuminates the shimmering threads that connect different forms of life on Earth and beyond. Her painting ‘Untitled’ (c. 1976), is a great example of her skyscape series and the centrepiece of this exhibition.Inspired by the late painter, the artists in this show share Hurtado’s belief in the universality of all life forms. Their practices inspire us to explore the natural world with wonder and collectively bear witness to its magical beauty. They interrogate assumed relationships between forms, revealing the harmonious connections between humans and nature. In their work, there is a visceral feeling that connects the viewer to the rhythms of nature.Fragmenting natural elements into their own visual language of abstract geometries or surreal dreamscapes, the artists in this show celebrate the inherent energy that binds us together. It is no coincidence that women share the same cycle as the moon–we are all part of a universal process of metamorphosis. At once meditative and transcendental, the works in this show encourage viewers to look inward to heighten their connection with the divine order of the universe.",I look at the moon like a fellow traveller,"32 St. George Street, W1S 2EA","Tue-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 11am-4pm", 30 May  - 20 Jul 2024

Moments after he stepped away from the feast, the hall in which he was seated is said to have collapsed, flattening all who were still inside.When excavating the dining hall, he was challenged with the gruesome task of identifying the bodies of the other not-so-fortunate guests who had also attended the banquet that evening. Flattened beyond identification, he managed to recall the other guests in attendance by way of remembering the seating arrangements within the hall.This experience is accredited to the development of the “memory theatre”, a system of mnemonics commended by both the Greeks and the Romans and popularized right up until the renaissance period. This method of Loci uses the human mind as a temporal scaffold – mapping information onto the spatial to aid with memory impressions, improve recall and assist in the invention of ideas.In this regard the psyche is formed around a distinction between the matter of an experience and its form. As Freud reasons in his ‘iceberg’ diagram, consciousness has its head above sea level whilst the bulk of the iceberg, the unconscious, remains beneath, concealed.A similar fashioning of Freud’s iceberg analogy is apparent in the collection of works H.E Morris presents in her first solo exhibition in London at LBF Contemporary, Of Death and Visions. Signifying simultaneously both the closure of and the opportunity for experience, this juxtaposition is the starting point for Morris’ exploration of the unconscious. The paintings become Morris’s memory theatre and we, her audience, are invited to consume.The works included in this show feature abstract landscapes inspired by the land that Morris feels akin, her birthplace of Upstate New York. Morris’ painting practice broadly explores perhaps the only Greek concepts we are yet to destroy – love and death.Brush strokes sit atop the various surfaces utilised by Morris, exposing traces of the invisible hand of the artist and the submerged unconscious at work. The varying surfaces used – linen, canvas and locally sourced fabrics – all react differently when paint is applied, masterfully weaving the gestures from depths to surface.Into the Fold features three fabrics sewn together. A see-through mesh fabric gives the viewer a rare chance to see beneath the surface of the painting, whilst the cobalt blue segment is porous, allowing the oil paint to permeate its vibrant weave. The surfaces are chosen purposely by Morris to limit the editing process, allowing her unaltered unconscious to reign free.Other works in the show such as Diving into the Wreck feature a figure which becomes an event within the landscape. A celebration of ambiguity; the figure reflects the transcendence of time and space carefully manifested by Morris striking the searchlights of sign and meaning.This body of works, both raw and delicate, allow us to climb Morris’ temporal scaffold, providing us brief moments of insight into her memory theater.H.E.

At once monumental and intimate in scale, his work recalls post-Minimalist sculpture that alludes to North America’s industrial past. Drew transforms accumulations of raw materials such as wood, glass, plaster, and cotton to articulate various overlapping themes: the cyclical nature of life and decay and the erosion and regeneration of nature from time. His surfaces surge with intrinsic energy, with a tension between the formal structure of the grid and the unruly energy of nature that is both creation and destruction.Drew’s second exhibition at Galerie Lelong, Paris, will highlight a new site-responsive explosion installation and a series of “core” works that include glass and painted plaster. Each new material offers Drew a new canvas of possibility of reinvention and extension and at the same time, the re-purposing of materials gives them new energy and meaning. Drew adapted the site responsive explosion to reflect Lelong’s historic 18th century environment. “The adaptability of the work is the life of the work,” says Drew, and the relationship and reinvention of the sculpture to site is a challenge he accepts.Drew’s most recent solo exhibitions have been at Yorkshire Sculpture Park (2023) and the Amon Carter Museum (2023-2024).

In 1962 she launched the magazine The Situationist Times, which she ran until 1967 with great strength of character, bringing her into contact with a large number of artists.Influenced in her early years by the colourful energy of the Dutch Cobra painters, she quickly moved on to explore, in a highly personal way, playful themes as well as poignant subjects such as war, migration and the emancipation of women. In recent years, her work has been widely recognised internationally through gallery exhibitions in Europe and New York, and in museums such as the Stedelijk Museum and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Abattoirs in Toulouse, and the Cobra Museum in Amstelveen.Her engraved work (lithography, silkscreen, etching, digital printing) spans six decades and remains relatively unknown, particularly in Paris, even though this is where many of these prints were produced. To coincide with the exhibition, Lelong Editions is publishing five new prints by Jacqueline de Jong, accompanied by a selection of rare works from the 1960s to the 2000s.",Jacqueline de Jong: Prints Off,"13, rue de Téhéran, 75008","Tue-Fri 10.30am-6pm, Sat 2pm-6.30pm", 16 May  - 29 Jun 2024

New drawings referencing influential poets will be on view, complemented by a selection of sculptures, the forms of which are comprised of characters from various alphabets, highlighting language and poetry as recurring sources of inspiration in the artist’s practice.Plensa’s works on paper often combine mixed media and collage, imbuing the works with a sculptural quality. In large scale drawings, Plensa geometrically arranges clippings of poems by masters of the genre—among them T.S. Eliot and Charles Baudelaire—merging the literary and visual arts. These collages are accented by shadowing and reliefs of abstracted portraiture, bringing depth to the two-dimensional forms. The artist has likened his approach to drawing and collage to the human body, bringing many individual elements together to form a more important whole. Plensa’s practice is guided by a desire to create unity through connections of the body and collective memory, and with these drawings offers an expression of a reflective inner world.In the small gallery space, a series of drawings that reference Shakespeare’s Macbeth will be on view. The story has long fascinated Plensa, who in 2023 contributed stage direction, costumes, and set design to a new staging of Giuseppe Verdi’s Macbeth at the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, Spain. In this new collection of drawings, Plensa considers the theme of sleeplessness in Shakespeare’s play, crafting dark and difficult to discern works that invoke the ominous paranoia of the story’s protagonist. In SLEEP NO MORE (2023), Plensa pairs imagery of wire busts, a common form in his sculptural practice, with text of the iconic phrase for which the work is titled. The heads appear back-to-back, seemingly morphing into one, while shadows obscure Shakespeare’s words to varying degrees, rendering some nearly illegible. Here, Plensa’s exploration of what the viewer sees—or does not see—recalls the role of Birnam Wood in Macbeth and the illusion of the advancing forest.The large-scale sculpture UTOPIA (2024), is on view, marking the debut of an entirely new sculptural form in the artist’s practice. Rendered in Cor-Ten steel, the sculpture reads “utopia,” the state of being from which it derives its title. With each letter composed of an amalgamation of characters from various alphabets, this work celebrates the diversity in our shared humanity and envisions a more beautiful world characterized by this unity. While Plensa has often incorporated language in his sculptures, UTOPIA is the first sculpture to do so in a horizontal means; this is also the artist’s first alphabet-based work to be rendered in Cor-Ten steel. With this work, Plensa demonstrates the continued innovation of his sculptural practice and his ongoing commitment to discovering the perfect material and technology for each individual work.",Jaume Plensa: Silent Diary,"528 West 26th Street, NY 10001",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 9 May  - 29 Jun 2024

They are striking for their diversity of materials, shapes and colours, and can be interpreted on several levels. Verboom’s sculpture is often associated with the notion of hybridisation, insofar as she brings together seemingly distant or even opposing elements to create new forms: parts of musical instruments, mechanical objects or anthropomorphic representations combine in a poetic narrative that arouses the viewer’s curiosity. This sculpture is, however, anything but anecdotal. There are numerous references to roots, both personal and collective, as well as to the history of art (witness the Madonnas series, and the references to Bourdelle and Maillol in the new works). Verboom places artistic gesture and technical experimentation at the heart of her practice: porcelain is sometimes enamelled, sometimes matt, and contrasts with crystal, which in the latest works evokes the milky whiteness of alabaster.For her first exhibition at Galerie Lelong & Co. she is presenting four Achronies, superimposed elements of different shapes, colours and materials that rise up in columns and evoke “cores”, cylindrical samples of soil that help us to better understand the geology and archaeology of a place. These are intimate, contemporary archaeologies, where we find superimposed the modelling of a clockwork mechanism, a double portrait of Virginia Woolf and Simone de Beauvoir, a Merovingian capital, an element from a flute, etc. In conversation with these totem poles, small-scale sculptures, figures and high-reliefs in clay and glass will also be shown.Upon graduating from the Paris École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts (2009), Verboom joined the De Ateliers artist-in-residence programme (Amsterdam, 2009/2011). Her recent solo exhibitions include Megaron, Wentrup Gallery, Berlin, 2023; Pistillus, le Voyage à Nantes, 2023; Chryséléphantine, La Verrière - Fondation d’entreprise Hermès (Brussels, 2023); Peptapon, Le Carré Centre d’art contemporain (Château-Gontier, 2021); La Vitrine, FRAC Île-de-France (Paris, 2020) and Lectio Difficilior Potior, at the Musée de l’Abbaye de Sainte-Croix (Les Sables, 2015).

White predominates in her paintings, though like her inanimate subjects, it is given profound dimension through her explorations of its reflective intricacies. The overall effect Watt achieves is one of absent presence.The new paintings at the gallery emerge from Watt’s ongoing study of the eighteenth-century portraitist Allan Ramsay (1713–1784)—whose work is a frequent touchstone for Watt, alongside that of Francisco de Zurbarán (1598–1664) and Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780–1867). Here, Watt excises props represented in Ramsay’s portraits of influential and self-possessed women of the period. Feathers, for example, were common attributes in the portraits he made of the women he knew well, a resonance felt in Watt’s single-feather still lifes Praise (2023) and Finger (2023).“The still life can be very intimate,” Watt has said. “And because of its close connection to us, how we view it is continually being redefined. It continues to evolve because it reflects us. So, by its very nature, it is linked to the portrait. The still life is a portrait without likeness.”Peale, at Independent, takes its name from the nineteenth-century American artist Raphaelle Peale, whose Venus Rising from the Sea—A Deception (After the Bath) (c. 1822) features a sheet so hyperreal that one visitor to his studio tried to remove the drape protecting Venus, thinking that the painting lay behind it.Watt borrows the Venus sheet with closer fidelity than is usual for references in her work, though here there is nothing behind Peale’s cloth. It falls as the original does and embraces its central place in the composition. Like a ghost, it appears to hang on the wall through uncanny force, delineated from the surrounding white by subtle modulations of shadow.Rosanna McLaughlin has written in Frieze: “No material could ever form such perfectly suggestive shapes, of course, and the hallucinatory nature of Watt’s compositions draws parallels with the paintings of Georgia O’Keeffe, whose furrowed and swollen landscapes thrum with sex. If O’Keeffe’s paintings are intensely physical, Watt’s are discarnate, untouched by the messy heat of real bodies...”Watt’s work engages with art history on a deep level, borrowing her referents’ techniques and subjects without the kind of direct reference that might render her engagement with it more illustrative. There is a cinematic nature to her work, even though she paints props she has excised from traditional portraiture. The works seduce with their implied narratives of solitude and allow for personal or dramatic projection through the profundity of their mystery.The technique on display impresses, but at its base Watt’s work is conceptual. The amount of detail she lavishes on these still lifes offers its own elusive story. The objects she selects have vivacity and character. She is a poet of the voids in our lives, whose verses are written in objects of the everyday.Watt (b. 1965, Scotland) came to prominence early in her career when she won the prestigious annual award of the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 1987. Her work has been shown at the National Gallery, London, where she also served as artist in residence; Dulwich Picture Gallery, and British Museum, London; Scottish National Portrait Gallery, National Galleries of Scotland, Royal Scottish Academy, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh; and the Gallerie degli Uffizi, Florence. She was awarded an OBE in 2008 and became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2017.

In America, this marked the period of color-field painting, with artists like Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman creating large-scale canvases filled with blocks of emotive, abstract color. In Europe, another type of color-form painting also became a mainstay of various avant-garde artists from Pierre Soulages and Alberto Burri, to Lucio Fontana and Zao Wou-Ki.From the 1950s onward, each of these artists used their own modes of color-form abstraction to explore the intrinsic relationship between light, energy, space, and matter. For Soulages, as his Outrenoir (“beyond-black”) paintings reveal, the concentration on black pigment allowed for the discovery of illumination and light. “My instrument is not black,” Soulages insisted “but the light reflected from the black.” His works including Peinture 101 x 130 cm, 16 août 2015 and Peinture 309 x 181 cm, 12 décembre 2013, exemplify his ethos: “I found that the light reflected by the black surface elicits certain emotions in me. These aren’t monochromes. The fact that light can come from the color which is supposedly the absence of light is already quite moving, and it is interesting to see how this happens.” By applying paint in dense, material layers and using varied tools as well as brushes to generate smooth and rough surfaces, Soulages created surface textures that absorbed or emitted light. “Rather than movement, I prefer to talk of tension,” Soulages said, “and rhythm, yes. We can also say form: a shaping of matter and light.”While Soulages made use of monochromatic fields of black to portray light, Italian artists such as Alberto Burri and Lucio Fontana took monochrome painting in other directions. For Burri, planes of single hues, as seen in Nero Cellotex (1986–87) became a means of exploring the innate nature and self- expressive potentials of painted matter—while for Fontana, monochromatic tone was a vehicle for the articulation of deeper understandings of cosmic space.In his investigations of space, including his Attese works, and Concetto spaziale, Attese (1968) in particular, Fontana destroyed the material surface of the canvas with a slash of a knife, opening up the saturated red picture plane to the embracing voids of space. In so doing, he created a painting that unites form, color, material, and space through his decisive gestures. A similar use of spontaneous energy to form painterly matter underpins the pictorial abstraction of Chinese artists like Zao Wou-Ki and Chu Teh-Chun, who, working in Paris from the 1950s onwards, sought to meld traditional Chinese painting with the color-form explorations of Western abstraction.By contrast, Pat Steir’s Waterfall series reflects the attempts of an American-born artist to draw inspiration from Eastern approaches to color and form. Deeply influenced by Chinese literati paintings, Zen Buddhism, and the example of John Cage, Steir’s work, exemplified by Another Place (2017), investigates the aesthetic potentials of chance, gravity, and the weight of pigment to generate a painting’s ultimate form. Steir has said, “The way colors mix and the way they touch each other explains the world to me like mathematics explains the world to a physicist.”",Color Form,"Ground Floor, 2 Ice House Street, Central",Mon-Fri 11am-7pm, 21 Mar  - 31 May 2024

Dash,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/n-dash/,"N. Dash’s paintings draw on the building blocks of our natural and constructed worlds, includingearth and water, jute and cotton, graphite and oil, along with oft-overlooked fabricated items such as architectural insulation and factory-produced cardboard. Across the works in the exhibition, these elements are recombined to elevate the structural, textural, and energetic synergies and tensions among them. A work whose hue resembles patinated copper might comprise Styrofoam insulation, or an image might be silkscreened onto a panel on which earth has been troweled and dried into a cracked, furrowed plane. There are slippages among the many materials, processes, and signifiers that are evoked in these paintings—each held together by careful, spare decisions.At the core of N. Dash’s work is a daily ritual wherein the artist rubs a small piece of white cotton between finger and thumb until the machine-loomed fibers fray and lose their gridded structure, decomposing into an abject tangle. For the artist, the fabric serves as a recording device on which actions are imprinted, energy is captured, and immaterial forces are stored. The resulting sculptures are colored by a patina of dirt and oils, transformed by the spontaneous movement of the artist’s body. The grid, one of modernism’s paradigmatic forms, is undone again and again in the artist’s hand—by the body, the weather, and the environment. The artist photographs iterations of these sculptures and silkscreens the images onto panels prepared with earth, such that the images undulate according to the earth’s topography. In addition, planes of color are silkscreened, leaving fields of rosette patterns that result from the halftone printing process.The works’ beveled edges reveal their earthen substrates, allowing them to breathe. In these carved-out margins, the layers of earth, gesso, and jute are rendered visible, exposing the quasi-geologic structure of each panel. This strategy appears differently in a series of works in which strings are embedded in, or excavated from, the earthen grounds, the latter creating fine trenches of negative space, where the materiality of the work is exposed and raw. Ecological concerns course through these paintings with references to human and nonhuman interconnection and intervention. They examine, on an intimate scale, the impact of touch on natural resources, and reckon with the ways in which synthetic materials contain, shape, and merge with the environment. Here, Photoshop can imitate a field of flowers with an algorithmic printing pattern, but a rosette is still a field of ones and zeros. These questions of mimesis, artificiality, and exploitation are at play in these paintings, but subtly so. Through the works on view, nature and byproducts of manufacture are counterposed on vertical stages of earth, uplifting this most fundamental material and source.",N.

On October 8, 2022, David Geffen Hall reopened as a welcoming cultural anchor for New York City, some 60 years after it was first inaugurated as the home of the New York Philharmonic. The new Hall reimagines the concert-going experience by providing more inclusive public spaces for diverse cultural performances and community uses. This initiative includes an annual program of art commissions, where all members of the public are invited to engage with the work of leading contemporary artists free of charge. The democratic approach instills a sense of welcome both indoors and out, beckoning those who may never have interacted with Lincoln Center or the New York Philharmonic, and encouraging those long familiar with the campus to see it afresh.Public Art Fund partnered with The Studio Museum in Harlem to advise Lincoln Center on the selection of artists for this first iteration of the art program. Two prominent sites were identified for the site-specific commissions: the 50-foot Hauser Digital Wall in the lobby, which Jacolby Satterwhite has animated with a richly layered and inclusive celebration of performance that brings into dialogue the past, present and future; and the Hall’s 65th Street façade, which Nina Chanel Abney has transformed into a captivating tribute to the vibrant history and culture of San Juan Hill. Both artists undertook extensive research to develop their works. They emerge as gifted visual storytellers, committed to a more inclusive understanding of the past while giving us all a sense of future potential at a moment of reopening and reinvention.The artworks are commissioned by Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in collaboration with The Studio Museum in Harlem and Public Art Fund.Nina Chanel Abney, San Juan HealNina Chanel Abney’s monumental work of art for the façade of David Geffen Hall pays homage to San Juan Hill. In the 1940s and 50s, this predominantly Black and Brown neighborhood was forcibly displaced to make way for redevelopment, including what would become Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Abney’s constellation of figures, words, shapes, and symbols reflects the thriving community that lived here. Featured residents include pioneering healthcare workers Edith Carter and Elizabeth Tyler. Also pictured are James P. Johnson, whose music gave rise to the Charleston dance craze, and Thelonious Monk, a pioneer of Bebop and other jazz styles. Reclaiming this important history in her bold and vibrant style, Abney aims to spark curiosity and inspire a more inclusive future.Jacolby Satterwhite, An Eclectic Dance to the Music of TimeJacolby Satterwhite’s commission for David Geffen Hall reconsiders the past, present, and future of Lincoln Center and the New York Philharmonic. An Eclectic Dance to the Music of Time weaves together archival images, live action footage, and digital animation. We see a colorful and densely layered festival of performance that traverses historical periods through virtual space. Satterwhite’s inclusive cast represents artists since the Philharmonic’s founding in 1842, while featuring young musicians and dancers from across New York City. They play instruments and dance on stages and sculptural monuments set into a landscape inspired by Central Park and surrounded by buildings covered in screens, reminiscent of Times Square. Grounded in a more democratic view of history, Satterwhite’s work offers us his playful and richly inventive vision of a creatively empowered future.Nina Chanel Abney is known for combining representation and abstraction. Her paintings capture the frenetic pace of contemporary culture. Broaching subjects as diverse as race, celebrity, religion, politics, sex, and art history, her works eschew linear storytelling in lieu of disjointed narratives. The effect is information overload, balanced with a kind of spontaneous order, where time and space are compressed and identity is interchangeable. Her distinctively bold style harnesses the flux and simultaneity that have come to define life in the 21st century. Through a bracing use of color and unapologetic scale, Abney’s canvases propose a new type of history painting, one grounded in the barrage of everyday events and funneled through the velocity of the internet.Abney’s work is included in collections around the world, including the Brooklyn Museum, The Rubell Family Collection, Bronx Museum, and the Burger Collection, Hong Kong. Her first solo museum exhibition, Nina Chanel Abney: Royal Flush, curated by Marshall Price, was presented in 2017 at the Nasher Museum of Art, North Carolina. It traveled to the Chicago Cultural Center and then to Los Angeles, where it was jointly presented by the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the California African American Museum. The final venue for the exhibition was the Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase College, State University of New York.Jacolby Satterwhite is celebrated for a conceptual practice addressing crucial themes of labor, consumption, carnality, and fantasy through immersive installation, virtual reality, and digital media. He uses a range of software to produce intricately detailed animations and live action film of real and imagined worlds populated by the avatars of artists and friends. These animations serve as the stage on which the artist synthesizes the multiple disciplines that encompass his practice, namely painting, performance, illustration, sculpture, photography, and writing. Satterwhite draws from an extensive set of references, guided by queer theory, modernism, and video game language to challenge conventions of Western art through a personal and political lens. An equally significant influence is that of his late mother, Patricia Satterwhite, whose ethereal vocals and diagrams for visionary household products serve as the source material within a decidedly complex structure of memory and mythology. Satterwhite received his BFA from the Maryland Institute College of Arts, Baltimore and his MFA from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. His work has been presented in numerous exhibitions and festivals internationally, including most recently at Haus der Kunst, Munich,2021; Gwangju Biennale, Gwangju,(2021; and Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, OH, 2021.Nina Chanel AbneySan Juan Heal, 2022Latex ink and vinyl mounted on glassCommissioned by Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in collaboration with The Studio Museum in Harlem and Public Art FundPhoto: Nicholas Knight, courtesy Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, The Studio Museum in Harlem, and Public Art Fund, NY.Jacolby SatterwhiteAn Eclectic Dance to the Music of Time, 2022HD color video and 3D animation27:23 minsCommissioned by Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in collaboration with The Studio Museum in Harlem and Public Art Fund© Jacolby Satterwhite.

Francis was a fixture in the 1970s downtown New York art scene, where her close circle consisted of artists Dan Christensen, Larry Poons, and Larry Zox, amongst other well-known second-generation Abstract Expressionists. Leading galleries including Andre Emmerich and Tibor de Nagy represented her during this period, and she was included in the 1973 edition of the Whitney Biennial. Art critic Peter Schjeldahl in 1973 positively reviewed her body of work, commenting in the New York Times that her “colors run to luxurious brown‐golds, dreamy blue greens and dusty pinks, though each canvas is alive with a variety of evanescent hues and tints.”Helen Frankenthaler and Clement Greenberg both owned paintings executed by Francis. Although she has previously been omitted from art history books on abstract expressionism and color field painting, this exhibition sets the stage for rediscovery in 2024, displaying 12 works that have not been shown in 50 years.Lincoln Glenn Gallery believes Sherron Francis deserves to be restored to her own context in art history. This exhibition reintroduces her intellectually conceived, radiant, and adventurous paintings, created between 1973 and 1977.

I know it only too well:Every name is a transplantation.Mum brings 1000 snails to heaven every day, she says. I think heaven is very big.In the watering can is poison for the snails.

Resembling fantastical-futuristic life forms (or landscapes?), these works, made of aluminum and bronze cast, exhibit finely branching structures and an organic surface, leaving behind a highly fragile impression.The reference to nature, particularly botany, is obvious, as the artist clearly names each work in relation to it. The resilient spruce serves as the namesake for Karner's nearly three-meter-high sculptures, titled ""Fichtengrau"" or ""Fichtengrün."" While evoking a clear image, the exhibited works only partially reflect this image in an altered form. Despite vaguely resembling dead trees in their vertical arrangement and barren appearance, the unconventional, almost bizarre forms of the sculptures immediately disrupt this clear image. They are based on concrete references from the animal and plant kingdom, such as mushrooms, branches, tree bark, or vineyard snails, which the artist combines into grotesque sculptural growths through casts. Additionally, fragmentary references to human intervention are hinted at when the individual elements are assembled into artistic assemblages. The idea of choreography becomes apparent when observing the sculptures.From a distance, the figurative silhouette of the objects initially comes to the forefront, only to reveal upon closer inspection a multitude of diverse organic forms, inevitably drawing the viewers' gaze into the depths of surreal landscape scenes. These are partly patinated and partly covered with clay slip by the artist. The result is an aesthetically homogeneous overall impression that almost gives the sculptures a classical appearance. From their observer position, humans gaze upon an artistic amalgam of our reality, distorted almost beyond recognition, frozen in the moment of its creation. Karner's reflections on the interplay between humans and nature seem to materialize in the sculptures: starting from the concrete motif of the spruce, which, as a particularly robust tree species in the 20th century, was predestined for reforesting forests, the full extent of human mismanagement of the past decades is vividly brought to light. In the face of climate change, tragically, the spruce is one of those tree species most severely affected by global warming.It is an observational glance at our present rather than a clear critique that Karner undertakes here – pessimism is foreign to the artist; rather, delicate signs of hope become discernible as individual shoots sprout from the underground of one of his sculptures. Karner has prepared the ground of specific works with seeds, the watering of which he personally undertakes.Consequently, during the exhibition period, the sculpture will undergo a metamorphosis that symbolizes the human potential to counteract the damage already done by showing mindfulness towards nature and not remaining indifferent.Text by Sergey HarutoonianAbout the artistKarl Karner (b.1973 in Feldbach, Austria) lives and works in Feldbach, Austria. Karner studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna under Professor Heimo Zobernig.Karner positions his work between the disciplines of visual arts, performance and dance theatre. Within his practice, Karner continuously discusses bodily perception and the concept of corporeality itself.

Nkanga fills indentations in these glass vials with scents or remedies, such as lavender (antioxidant, anti-anxiety), chamomile (anti-inflammatory, soothing), or St John’s Wort (anti-bacterial, anti-depressant), representing circulatory systems of materials that are harvested, traded and ingested – both on an individual and a global level.Other zones of respite in the exhibition include a carpet installation, coloured in deep red and purple tufts, based on the minerals pyrargyrite (from the Greek Pyr for fire and Argyros for silver) with the addition of actual samples of shungite (a carbon-rich metallic black stone, known to block electromagnetic radiation and purify water) and tourmaline (a crystalline gemstone valued by some for its detoxifying properties). New tapestry works by Nkanga employ a multilayered surface of fibrous layers, some incorporating figurative and evocative imagery, while there are also abstract and malleable levels to these complex textiles, allowing the uppermost black veils to be sculpted and shifted by the artist’s hand. Flame-licked ceramic towers made from stacked and striated columns of crackelured cylinders (produced for a major museum show in Spain last year) create tree trunk-like punctuations, each work accompanied by bowls of sustaining seeds, soil or materials proffered as ritualised gifts.Below this otherworldly landscape is a dark cavern of voices, a six-channel audio piece performed by the artist under the Pidgin Nigerian title, Wetin You Go Do (2020), asking ‘what are you going to do’? In this soundscape, Nkanga chants, sings and pronounces in six distinct voices and overlapping characters; some representing mother earth, others simulating extreme psychological states and one even caricaturing a spokesperson at a political rally.Combining poetry, sculpture, audio and performance, Nkanga has created a complex, fluctuating environment in which some elements appear to have been scorched by flames, while others are, by their very nature, reparative or restorative.

A coalescence of archival pigment prints, C-type prints, cylindrical magnets, folded pigment prints, found posters, galvanized metal, paper, spray and watercolour paint, these large-scale compositions, spanning ten by fifteen-foot panels, intricately incorporate magazine pages, photographs, drawings, vintage poster and other ephemera, both personal and unfamiliar. Pierson's meticulous process of addition and rearrangement of diverse components – either produced by Pierson himself or discovered during his travels – mirrors that of a collector; each material is afforded a prominent presence within the whole.Pierson is acclaimed for his evocative word-sculptures and installations created by re-appropriating commercial signage and large-scale vintage lettering. The first word sculpture in the exhibition is titled Peter Blake (2024), named after the leading English visual artist who, having created the design for multiple iconic musical records including The Beatles' 1967 album ‘Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band’ and the 2012 Brit Award statuette, became a key figure in the pop art movement. Pierson’s sculpture embodies the connection between the two artists – one which began in the 1960s when the young artist first encountered the work of Peter Blake distributed in the media. Years later, the artists would meet, with Blake inviting Pierson to visit his studio – an encounter that left a lasting impression on both. Blake himself was inspired to create a series of word sculptures bearing Pierson’s name: Appropriating Jack Pierson, Copying Jack Pierson and Borrowing from Jack Pierson (all 2002). While Pierson has been profoundly inspired by the work of Peter Blake – his own sculptural homage suggesting echoes of the playful and colourful arrangements of Blake’s work – this is the first time he has reciprocated this creative exchange by producing a word piece that directly references this history. Peter Blake also carries the legacy of the transformative period of cultural exchange between the UK and US in the 1960s, intertwining personal history with wider cultural influences. The exchange between Pierson and Blake serves as a testament to the power of artistic inspiration and collaboration, transcending time and distance to create connections within the ever-evolving landscape of contemporary art.The exhibition will also feature a floor sculpture, Everything you ever wanted (2012), comprised of a stack of letters, and a grid of drawings titled The Order of the Star (2015). alongside additional word sculptures such as Nostalgia, A Friend, You Are The Sun, Room For Angels, Thank You and Water (all 2024), the latter a chain of painted wooden and metal letters that tumble down as if cascading from their position on the gallery wall.",Jack Pierson,"67 Lisson Street, NW1 5DA",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm and by appointment, 24 May  - 3 Aug 2024

Mirroring its musical counterpart, Lontano – which is Italian for “far away” or “in the distance” ­– unfolds its rich interplay of staccato and legato passages (musical terms for disjunctive and flowing) that build and eventually merge into a harmonious whole. The relative quiet and emptiness communicated by light neutral tones are contrasted with episodes of frenetic texture and dark-hued intensity, creating a sense of narrative that is rare in the abstract realm.Across the room from this monumental triptych is Le Brun’s latest searching venture into multi-panelled composition. Echoing the artist’s figurative beginnings, Phases of the Moon II (2023) finds inspiration from lunar references throughout art history. Episodes of sunlight and moonlight follow each other, embodied through alternating passages of warm and cool light. Emerging as if from the intervals between consciousness and sleep, Phases of the Moon II speaks in the symbolic language of memory and imagination.Also presented in this multi-sensory dialogue is the captivating oil on canvas diptych, January Just (2024). Much like Lontano, this large panoramic work resembles an extended musical composition, challenging the viewer to engage with it over time. Through the build up of structure and material, January Just evokes a sense of imminence reminiscent of modern classical music. Painted incidents that emerge within the textured surface are like clues that invite the spectator to trace how its unique appearance came into being.The exhibition also features two single paintings, Promenade (2023) and Tidings (2023). Employing similar motifs as a unifying thread, these works invite the spectator to travel further into the metaphorical landscape that Le Brun has created. In Promenade, the canvas becomes a vast expanse of potentiality akin to the sea, where each colour appears to break the surface or be submerged beneath it, waiting to see and to be seen. While Tidings draws inspiration from the artist's intimate connection to the landscape of the Somerset levels, it is not a literal depiction of a specific scene. Instead, by means of its subtle layers, the painting re-enacts the atmospheric nuances that brings these English grasslands to life.The exhibition ‘Phases of the Moon’ invites viewers to a visual encounter that transcends the boundaries of traditional pictorial expression.

Lisson Gallery Beijing,Beijing,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/zhao-gang/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lisson-Gallery-Beijing.jpg,Zhao Gang,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/zhao-gang/,"One of the highlights of the exhibition is T. S. Eliot (2024), through which Zhao investigates the American- English poet for first time in his practice. Zhao came across a biography of Eliot from a used bookstore in London, and read it on his flight to New York. The tense relationship between Eliot and his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, resulted in an extremely difficult marriage, bedeviled by nervous and physical illness on both sides. Eliot’s “elite, super-controlled, white male personality” and the way it tribulated his personal life sparked the artist's philosophical contemplation on love and intimacy between individuals. In the suite of paintings presented in Beijing, Zhao uses raw pork and lamb legs as primary motifs that symbolically allude to the human form, thereby challenging the audience's prevonceived notions through techniques of deconstructivism reminiscent of the 1980s. Adjacent to slabs of meat, portraits of Eliot and Haigh-Wood are rendered deathly pale, mirroring their dissonant union.Still life remains a recurring motif in Zhao Gang's practice. Sequels to his thematic exploration of still life florals and mounds of meat during the pandemic, select works in this exhibition feature various kinds of meat, vegetables, wine glasses, and flowers arranged in domestic settings. These juxtapositions manifest Zhao’s displaced sensibilities amidst his tumultuous emotional landscape. Having recently relocated to a new studio after years of living abroad, Zhao Gang finds solace in solitary contemplation and reveries in between his creatice pursuits; with each relocation, he grows increasingly mindful and appreciative of his surrouindimgs. With a disruptive impulse, as seen in Camellia (2023), the artist manipulates the scale and perspective of the cut of meat and flowers within the pictorial plane, elevating the viewers from reality through a super-magnified lens, prompting introspection on one’s own existential fate within this phenomenological experience.Representation of food also appears in a series of small paintings rendered in circular, oval, and lozenge forms. These compositions feature raw meat-cuts, cooked and uncooked fish, as well as partially consumed fruits and vegetables. In traditional Chinese culture, the image of bountiful food symbolises aspirations for a prosperous life, where chicken, duck, fish, and pork are the four main dishes prevalent among banquets and feasts. These works reflect the artist's enduring yearning for a stabile and reclusive life, after years spent drifting overseas.This series also portrays large animal carcasses exposed in the outdoors. The depicted grasslands and mutton are symbols of a nomadic lifestyle, echoing Zhao’s past experiences living in places scattered across the globe, intertwined with his pursuit of inner peace by traversing the prairies on motorcycle. Zhao Gang once said, ""I believe the most important thing in life is, regardless of your status, you always have the ability to let go, and pick up where you left off at any given moment."" With his intellectual preoccupation seeping through the canvas, Zhao reflects on what his diasporic identity means in the present, while elucidating the significance of those seemingly mundane yet deeply treasured aspects of his daily life.About the artistZhao Gang delves into the fluidity of individual identities, the clash of cultures, and the intricate interplay of fragmented historical events. His works are deeply rooted in a rich and nuanced cultural heritage, drawing inspiration from both classical and contemporary, Western and Chinese influences. Within his work, patterns and concepts gracefully unfurl, expertly deconstructing visual narratives. At the age of 18, Zhao Gang became the youngest member to join the avant-garde artist group known as the ‘Star Group’, heralding the onset of the modern art movement in China. Driven by a pursuit of artistic and political freedom, they laid the foundational stones of contemporary Chinese art. Zhao Gang’s artistic style is characterized by audacious and almost exaggerated narrative techniques and brushwork. These elements serve not only as a perpetual reaffirmation of his own existence but also as a defiant stance against the prevailing trend of artistic refinement. His works celebrate the unfettered freedom and authenticity inherent in painting. His experience of studying abroad and living overseas since 1983 has given his works a diverse style with distinctive international characteristics. Upon returning to Beijing in around 2006, Zhao Gang redirected his focus to the intricate interplay between his unique cross-cultural experiences and the annals of Chinese history. Born in this land, yet traversing the path of a new immigrant, he grapples with the sentiment of estrangement that threads through his art.Born in Beijing in 1961, Zhao Gang currently works and lives in New York and Beijing. He attended the Maastricht Institute of Arts (formerly Stadsacademie voor Toegepaste Kunsten) in The Netherlands (1983), and Vassar College, New York (1984-1987). He obtained a Master of Arts degree from Bard College, New York in 1999. Zhao Gang has held solo exhibitions at various institutions, including the Long Museum (Chongqing Branch), Chongqing, China (2022); Long Museum (West Bund Branch), Shanghai, China (2021); Kuandu Museum of Fine Arts, Taipei (2020); Pérez Art Museum, Miami, FL, USA (2019); Museum of Contemporary Art, Santiago, Chile (2016); Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing, China (2015); Suzhou Museum, Suzhou, China (2015); Today Art Museum, Beijing, China (2011); Hong Kong Arts Centre, Hong Kong, China (2008); and He Xiangning Art Museum, Shenzhen, China (2006), among others.

The artist then paints a spontaneous composition on one side of that dividing boundary, and then repeats it on the other. The deliberate ensuing ambiguity as to which side was painted first questions notions of originality, the authentic gesture, and completion.Upon entering the gallery, visitors are met with Piffaretti’s abstractions in close dialogue with one another. The artist views his oeuvre as a constantly refined singular work, carefully curating exhibitions to feature compositions from various years, often with a decade or more between them.In this instance, the exhibition is comprised of paintings made over a span of thirty years, and traces back to some of the earliest pieces made using Piffaretti’s signature motif. The oldest work on view, Untitled (1987), was created just one year after the artist began consistently basing his practice around “the central mark”.In addition to the division of his canvases, there are other facets that can also be traced through Piffaretti’s practice. For example, Untitled (1990) features a sequence of crossed red lines forming a lattice structure and Untitled (2008) presents a series of multicolored bulbous shapes, both recurring elements within his larger body of work. These details are present in other paintings such as Untitled (2005) and Untitled (1994) respectively.Piffaretti's commitment to looking back, whether immediately with his mirrored canvases or historically through references, is central to his method. In the same vein, the exhibition’s title, an adoption of a 1969 quote by Man Ray directly translating to “I have never painted a recent painting,” is a nod to Piffaretti’s belief that no work is ever truly new. To him, nothing is without precedent. As well as referencing his own previous pieces, the artist has cited influence from an array of painters, ranging from the likes of Marcel Duchamp and Henri Matisse to Barnett Newman and Andy Warhol. The works resulting from Piffaretti’s “system” act as a physical representation of the artist’s inclination to question the traditions and institution of painting.",Bernard Piffaretti: Je n’ai jamais peint un tableau récent,"1037 N.

Sugimoto not only follows in the footsteps of Isaac Newton, who published his work Opticks: or, A Treatise of the Reflexions, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light in 1704, but also realigns his practice from a photographer of black- and-white fields, forms and figures, towards a scientific surveyor of blazing color and invisible possibility.“These are the first color photographs I have made. With the help of my prism, I created rainbows in the room and shot them every morning. I entered into this zone of light and shadow, while recreating the feeling of shock and surprise that Newton must have felt. This light had no shape or form. In a certain sense, it was pure. These were gradations of light that emerged out of the darkness and began to shift. Nothing is in focus, so there is this feeling of ecstasy or rapture.”Beginning with a series of Polaroids after being gifted the last Japanese batch of the film in 2009, Sugimoto isolated sections of visible, spectral light using a prism set up at home, often focusing on the edges where these glowing patches emerged or returned to darkness. For the first time, Sugimoto will present this prism apparatus in the space of this show, positioned to capture the light from the gallery's skylight at certain moments throughout the day. He also further split the beam of light using a mirror that he could rotate, in order to expand each color into further variations of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, even introducing second, third or more colors into a single image. After contemplating and finessing his studies for a decade, Sugimoto only began to scan and enlarge the Opticks to make unique C-prints in 2018.“Why must science always cut up the whole into little pieces when it identifies specific attributes? The world is filled with countless colors, so why did natural science insist on just seven? I seem to get a truer sense of the world from those disregarded intracolors. Does not art serve to retrieve what falls through the cracks, now that scientific knowledge no longer needs a God?”The show’s title, ‘Optical Allusion,’ relates to the idea that photography is ultimately a subjective version of the truth, given that every individual perceives color differently, whether physiologically or culturally. It also ‘alludes’ to the similarities between the scale, ambition and immersion of these photographic works with those of pioneering modernist abstractionists and contemporary color field painters. Ultimately, Sugimoto is depicting not only emotional states of mind but also intangible, otherworldly spectacles – abstract effects which he claims could even be achieved on another planet, independent of our earthly atmosphere, materials or landscapes.“All my life I have made a habit of never believing my eyes – there has never been any guarantee that what I see is actually there.”A room dedicated to the Opticks series forms the culmination of Sugimoto’s major retrospective exhibition, ‘Time Machine’, which was first staged at Hayward Gallery, London (October 11, 2023 – Jan 7, 2024) and has now toured to UCCA Beijing (until June 23, 2024).",Hiroshi Sugimoto: Optical Allusion,"504 West 24th Street, NY 10011",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 2 May  - 2 Aug 2024

Central to her work are the themes of shifting meanings, mistranslations across languages, definitions, and the seamless fusion of creatures into a unified whole, where utopia meets surrealism. The exhibition features a glass bird enveloped in smoke, Jens (2023). This is from a series of hand-blown Murano glass creatures that Prouvost debuted in her exhibition at the Nasjonalmuseet in Oslo, 2022. Human, avian, and aquatic forms gracefully intertwine, symbolising the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of species in the age of climate change and global migration. Birds, captured in various poses, appear on the brink of transformation as if embarking on a migratory journey alongside its aquatic counterparts. Prouvost employs the transformative power of smoke to craft an immersive journey, seamlessly intertwining various facets of her practice deeply rooted in nature.The new tapestry We Will Keep Cool (Las Pozas) (2024) depicts diverse landscapes and familiar motifs in Prouvost's oeuvre. Set in British poet Edward James’ surrealistic garden ‘Las Pozas’ in Mexico, it depicts her own work Cooling system 3 (for global warming), 2018 which offers up a future proposition as a solution to global warming, as well as characters from her film They Parlaient Idéale. Translation becomes a central theme not only through language but also through converting motifs into different mediums and referencing previous artworks.Further into the space, a series of paintings The Octopus Body make their debut in China following an initial presentation in 'Stranded by Your Side' (Lisson Gallery, New York, 7 September – 14 October 2023). Each canvas, blending playful allure and sensual intrigue, is adorned with Prouvost's characteristic imagery and text that directly addresses the viewer. Going beyond her customary palette, these works embrace softer tones — pastel blues, greys, and flesh hues — conjuring the shades of a twilight seascape and the ethereal life beneath its surface. A motif that frequently inhabits Prouvost’s creative realm, depictions of swirling octopi and swimming fish symbolise the enigmatic threshold between thinking and feeling, human life and sea creatures.Amidst the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, Prouvost delved into the intricacies of our collective adaptation to a world in flux, probing the origins of language, the sensorial imparting of knowledge and charting our trajectory forward through her film Re-dit-en-un-in-a-learning (2020). The work serves as a poignant reflection on the human experience on learning and belonging, care and connection and is a sequel to Prouvost's 2017 work, DIT LEARN. She associates words to different images, destabilizing our understanding of language and its structure of knowledge, and exploring a pre-lingual world. The title itself, a play on words combining ""dit"" (a verb meaning ""to speak"" or ""speaking"") and ""learn,"" encapsulates the essence of linguistic evolution and the perpetual process of relearning. Prouvost explains, ""You cannot find the words for the images you see... All becomes one.""Prouvost's first major exhibition in Australia, 'Oui Move In You', runs from 23 March to 10 June at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne, encompassing new installations and a survey of existing work to transform ACCA’s architecture into a labyrinthine and other-worldly environment. Concurrently to the show in Shanghai, Prouvost will present a solo exhibition at Fosun Foundation in Chengdu, showcasing two films including Re-dit-en-un-in-a-learning (2020).",Laure Prouvost: Pulled Towards You,"2/F, 27 Huqiu Road, Huangpu District, 200002",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 27 Apr  - 22 Jun 2024

As Jackson Pollock remarked of his friend and fellow Abstract Expressionist: when Kanemitsu was painting, it was as if he was nature itself. Expressing the complex human experience of natural forces in sumi ink, watercolor, and acrylic, these works embody both the splendor and the perils of a sunset in a scorching desert, the churning waves of a Pacific storm, or rivers of rain in a summer deluge. Even as he battled cancer, which would take his life at the age of 69, Kanemitsu embarked on a final series of paintings featuring fields of radiant, scintillating dots. Paired with energetic dashes and waves of molten color, they illuminate the canvas like the prickle of warm sunlight on skin.Born in Utah and raised in Hiroshima, Kanemitsu enlisted in the United States Army in 1941 and had his first exhibition in an army detention camp, where he was held after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. After living in Europe, then in New York, where he studied at the Art Students League and became an active member of New York’s Abstract Expressionist school, Kanemitsu was brought to Los Angeles in 1961 to work at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop. Kanemitsu became a revered art educator in LA, teaching at Chouinard Art Institute and Otis Art Institute over the next several decades.The exhibitions and community gatherings that Kanemitsu staged at 800 Traction Avenue were vital to the flourishing of the Arts District, promoting artistic exchange within the LA arts scene and supporting the work of young local artists, particularly those in the Japanese American community.

William Eric Brown’sworks — the source images for which were taken in Antarctica in the 1960s by the artist’s father while serving in the US Navy and stationed on an icebreaker — are instilled with new significance through his manipulation and reconceptualization, which address the current reality of climate change and its effects on the arctic. Sophia Chai explores her memory of learning the Korean alphabet as a child through her work. By drawing and painting the shapes and lines of the characters on the walls and floor of her studio, Chai reimagines them in space, thereby abstracting written communication into an embodiment of the sensation of each word being formed inside the mouth.Sheida Soleimani stages elaborately constructed tableaux to address interwoven narratives of family, politics, and caregiving that trace both personal and public histories. Her carefully fabricated scenes demonstrate her commitment to approaching her practice with measured sensitivity; rather than divorcing her subjects from their own realities, Soleimani creates a contemplative space in which each incorporated object or image conveys an intentional message. Similarly, Shaun Pierson’s work illuminates the complex dynamics in the relationship between photographer and subject. Entwining conflicting sensations of inhibition and desire, Pierson lays bare the often simultaneously transactional and vulnerable apparatus and process of making photographs. Kevin Landers’ photographs, taken on the streets of New York, are rooted firmly in the here and now. He documents a collection of seemingly unnoticed moments, paying careful attention to unexpected details that, more often than not, most people would simply walk past — ephemera such as an abandoned shopping cart or an intricately woven spider web.Queer desire and a longing for another space and time are explored through the re-authoring of found or archival images in the works of Gonzalo Reyes Rodriguez and Brittany Nelson. Rodriguez pairs images from his own history with a series of photographs he purchased from a bookshop in Mexico City — dated between 1987 and 1993, the found snapshots evidence the personal experiences of a young, presumably queer, man known to us as “Technoir.” By combining the two archives, Rodriguez invites us to dwell in a space of merged memories, neither of which we can fully inhabit, and of the desire to know more. While at first glance Brittany Nelson’s use of archival materials is less overtly personal, her work considers themes of otherness, isolation, and the desire for connection. In one of the series on view, she perceived a sense of romantic devastation in the images taken by Opportunity, the Mars rover, which she amplifies by re-printing them using the 1920s analog bromoil photographic process, thereby infusing them with an added eerie, otherworldly quality.Though varied in their approaches to photographic practice, what unifies these artists is their investigation of longing, care, and lineage—familial and otherwise—and the way in which they use the medium and the process of making the work as a means to engage with others, with themselves, and to challenge expectations. Generating a constellated conversation that draws upon photography’s history, yet turns toward something altogether new, the artists included in Tiptoeing Through the Kitchen, Recent Photography imbue the seemingly unknown with flashes of recognition.","Tiptoeing Through the Kitchen, Recent Photography","531 West 24th Street, NY 10011",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 26 Apr  - 8 Jun 2024  
Luhring Augustine Tribeca,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/tomm-el-saieh-and-diego-singh-flaming-mirror/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Tomm El-Saieh,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/tomm-el-saieh/,"Text by Stephanie Seidel, Monica and Blake Grossman Curator, Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami:A few years ago, seemingly out of nowhere, objects like café chairs and bike saddles suddenly burst into flames in the streets near a London high-rise. It was the “Walkie Talkie” building’s concave, mirrored façade reflecting the sun so intensely, even on cloudy days, that it created extremely powerful rays of heat. Acting like a burning mirror, the building’s surface concentrated light into the more palpable element of fire. The intangible optical started to forcefully affect the tactile environment.The title of Tomm El-Saieh’s and Diego Singh’s two-person exhibition, Flaming Mirror, evokes an image similar to this burning mirror effect. Five paintings by each artist, all developed over the last two years, face each other. The work’s rhythmic and chromatic surfaces appear to bounce off each other, like sounding boards or infinity mirrors exposed to their echoes and resonances, with the viewer located in the space between. While the works are not exact juxtapositions of each other, they certainly convey that the two artists have known each other for almost twenty years, working side by side, including together operating an artist-run gallery in Miami Beach, CENTRAL FINE.El-Saieh’s and Singh’s works both explore connections between chromatic and tactile qualities in abstraction, approached, however, from vastly different angles. Accordingly, “flaming mirror” is not just a metaphor for the spatial dynamic apparent in the exhibition, but also reflects the two artist’s physical and metaphorical handling of color within their respective works. Color does not just circumscribe the chromatic, “(it) is the name given to forces that allow us to confront the uneasy task of marking difference,” as artist Amy Sillman writes.[1]Informed by the rich history of Haitian painting, yet bypassing its largely figurative tradition, El-Saieh combines washed-out, watercolor-like planes with dense and rhythmic patterns of dry-rubbed paint. This lattice of marks may appear to viewers like maps or grids, or act like Rorschach tests. The various layers of paint appear to operate at different speeds; the velocity of the poured, cloud-like paint of the background, contrasts with the laborious brushstrokes on the surface, inscriptions that appear meticulously chiseled.On the other hand, Singh’s handling of paint erases its own traces of application. Oil and acrylic paint — poured and brushed in various ways — create obscured layers to the point of becoming impenetrable. Figure and ground meld into one colorful surface, wrapped in meshes of yellow, green, and red. Testing the legacies of modernism and the boundaries of language, Singh’s paintings explore the ways that abstraction and vibrancy relate to representations of queerness. In Singh’s work color appears at times dense and sticky, at others lucid and luminous; lines, fine like hair, run through the paintings, and then –– in a flash –– the silhouette of a figure materializes out of the thicket of marks.Just like light in a burning mirror, color in El-Saieh’s and Singh’s paintings is both a visual and a tactual component. Arguing for color as a “shamelessly plastic element” art historian Lex Morgan Lancaster states: “Chromatic abstraction can […] engage forms of spectatorship beyond the normative, not cohering a figure but producing more haptic encounters.”[2] In bundling, bouncing, and refracting light through various ways of handling color, El-Saieh and Singh open a space of articulation that reaches beyond language. Flaming Mirror communicates not only visually but viscerally through the entire range of senses––touch, smell, sound, and sight––, which might affect its surroundings in wholly unexpected ways, just short of bursting into flames.About the artistsTomm El-Saieh (b. 1984, Port-au-Prince, Haiti) is of Haitian, Palestinian, and Israeli descent.

Her healing journey has resulted in a prolific series of works that have evolved into a playful yet formidable anthology of Latinx and Mexican-American experiences in Southern California. Diaz's surreal paintings chronicle a collective unconscious of cultural iconography, pop references, current events, and familial dynamics and traditions that shape the worldview of the artist and her communities. In Diaz's latest series, she expands her visual storytelling to encompass music and performance through the Northern Mexican genre of narrative ballads, the corrido.KARLA DIAZ: Mujer Valiente y Los Diablitos (The Brave Woman and The Little Devils) invites you to the artist's fantasy world of her alter ego, Mujer Valiente, the lead singer of the band, Los Diablitos, and their tour through various beloved locations in East LA, from Mariachi Plaza to Whittier Boulevard. The exhibition elaborates on the storytelling of the corrido, where the artist has flipped its traditional tropes to empower women. Historically, corridos have been used as a forum for oral histories and storytelling, facilitating social messages crooned by heroic men, where, in contrast, women are often nonexistent or mentioned in allegories warning against social deviance. Diaz's reinterpretation not only flips the gender roles but also brings new content to a genre that, in its contemporary moment, has had controversy and even legal ramifications for songs promoting illegal activities, narcotics, misogyny, violence against women, and femicide. Her artistic agency is a powerful testament to the strength and resilience of women, inspiring us all to challenge societal norms and reclaim our narratives.Through the lyrics—sung, performed, and vibrantly painted on canvas—we learn the story of the brave woman who does not even fear the devil (“no le teme ni al diablo”), and her determination and resilience in overcoming a broken heart. The storytelling in corridos, like many ballads, is abstracted and blends fact and probability with fiction and drama for effect. Diaz adapts this in full force—painting lyrics saturated in her distinctive palette of rainbow hues, dreamy washes, and colors that conjure the magic of cultural vernacular, from cheerfully painted neighborhood shops to bougainvillea pinks, cactus greens, colorful textiles, and concert costumes. In these works, the artist often assumes fantasy characters, taking up roles of power and positions that have typically been dominated by men, such as a corrido singer, a bullfighter, or a boxer. Amidst the paintings, the exhibition's installation also features a music video and a large painted backdrop that immerses viewers inside her imaginary concert hall.The narratives tell the story of the Latina artist who dreams of being a star and what it would be like to occupy positions of power that women often have little or no access to. Adapting the corrido genre to playfully carry mythical characters and woman-centered novellas of love, abandonment, and heartache with urgent and pressing social themes of protest, immigration, and political unrest. Diaz's works embrace, amplify, and provide an array of emotional releases through humor, earnestness, and nostalgia. Mujer Valiente reconstitutes the corrido as a space for radical discourse. The exhibition and corrido not only tell the story of an individual woman's strength but also celebrate her neighbors and friends who support and cheer for her—essentially, a love song for Diaz's community.Karla Diaz (b. 1976, Los Angeles) lives and works in Los Angeles, she received her MFA from the California Institute of the Arts in 2003 and a BA from California State University Los Angeles in 1999. Diaz is a co-founder, alongside Mario Ybarra Jr., of the collective and community artist space Slanguage in Wilmington, CA. Diaz’s works have been exhibited nationally and internationally at the 18th Street Art Center, Santa Monica, CA; the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, CA; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, CA; Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, LAXART, Hollywood, CA; Pitzer College, Claremont, CA; California State University Los Angeles, CA; San Jose Museum of Art, CA; Institute for Contemporary Art, Boston, MA; Hyde Park Art Center, Chicago, IL; Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, MI; the Serpentine Gallery, London, U.K.; and Museo Casa de Cervantes, Madrid, Spain.

Luis De Jesus Los Angeles,Los Angeles,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/john-valadez-chaos-anime/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",John Valadez,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/john-valadez/,"A trailblazer of the early Chicano Arts Movement in the 1970s and 80s, John Valadez’s work has come to define an iconography of Chicano experience in the city by catalyzing its changing dynamics and reconstructing a mythical allegory that speaks to an alternate vision. Through a multidisciplinary practice spanning 45 years, encompassing documentary photography and portraiture, public murals, paintings, and pastel works, Valadez has cultivated a style that transcends genre designations. His work evokes a fluidity between multiple cultures and visual lexicons, effectively mirroring the unsettled experience of the Chicano identity. Valadez continues to pursue politically engaged work—a persistent voice championing generations of Chicano and Latinx communities.JOHN VALADEZ: Chaos Anime  presents new paintings that address the shifting global dynamics and social climates facing new generations of Chicanos today, alongside recent works that revisit earlier themes. Together, the works exhibit the breadth of the artist’s social commentaries and further contextualize his lauded approach to painting. Drawing from current events, cultural histories, city life, and such experiences filtered through lucid dreaming, Valadez implements realism, mannerism, abstraction, and montage as a vehicle for allegory and satire to ignite a myriad of socio-political conversations.Themes of invisible borders, sublime skies, and tempestuous seas, and juxtapositions between reality and dreams and the natural world versus the consequences of human interferences, are but some of the constants throughout the trove of Valadez’s urban proverbs. A pivotal moment in Valadez’s new body of work is his extension of Chicano Movement principles, speaking to global matters of displacement, gentrification, economic disparities, famine, the environment, and geopolitics.The exhibition’s title work, Chaos (2024)—among his most impressive and important work to date—is a new mural-scaled painting that dismantles the binaries and clichés of “haves and have-nots” narratives. Compositionally split in two, the work is Valadez’s read on today’s state of the union, a horror vacui of crises weighing social violence, environmental, and economic issues. The allegory presents new perspectives on borders and speaks to new generations of Chicanos making reverse migrations from the US to Mexico in hopes of improved cultural connections and quality of life.Shipwreck Cruise (2024) presents a critique of tourism’s effect on locals and their environments. Against a tranquil open sea, suspended in the aftermath of an event we are left to imagine, an acidic skyline of yellows disrupts the sea and sky in a haze indistinguishable from sunrise, sunset, or pollution. The mysterious scene presents a conceptual background for us to locate our complicities, empathies, and apathies, and follow the lead of the basket-donning woman at the helm of the ship, looking to the horizon for new solutions.Other recent works, Bambi Negra (2018) and Piernas Anime (2017), exemplify different approaches to Valadez’s wry satire, where it is not always extended outward but also takes criticality inward, including self-reflection in the case of Bambi Negra, depicting one of his dreams, and the cultural ruminations of Piernas Anime, influenced by the many layers of gender dynamics of Southern California car show culture. Piernas Anime, translated as “anime legs,” exemplifies an alloy of Valadez’s influences from the futurism aesthetics present in Japanese Anime, to mannerism and surrealism. The painting presents a tableau that subverts the male gaze and machismo hierarchies of classic car shows. With symbols, figures, and activities occurring in the foreground and background, the paintings resist hierarchies and contain multiple entry points.The works in Chaos Anime mark an exciting moment in Valadez’s career. Radical and indefatigable, Valadez’s allegories, cutting satire, masterful color, and playful yet dead-panned pastiche bring a refreshed sensibility of endurance despite the capriciousness of time.John Valadez (b.1951, Los Angeles, CA) is a painter, photographer, and muralist living and working in Los Angeles. Valadez studied at East Los Angeles Junior College from 1970-72 and earned his BFA at California State University, Long Beach in 1976. Valadez was active in early impactful collectives such as Los Four and Centro de Arte Publico. Valadez’s critically acclaimed 35-year retrospective, Santa Ana Condition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, CA, traveled to the National Mexican Museum of Art, Chicago, IL, and the Vincent Price Museum, East Los Angeles College, CA. Valadez has exhibited in major canonical exhibitions contextualizing Chicano and Mexican-American art internationally and has numerous federal and state mural commissions throughout California, Texas, and France.Notable collections include the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, CA; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, CA; The Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA; The Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY; Brooklyn Museum, NY; National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian, Washington, DC; Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, La Jolla, CA; The Cheech Marin Collection, Riverside, CA; The Mexican Museum, San Francisco, CA; The Bass Museum of Art, Miami Beach, FL; National Mexican Museum, Chicago, IL; Centre d’Art, Santa Monica, Barcelona, ES; El Centro Cultural Tijuana, BC, MX; Musée d’Aquitaine, Bordeaux, FR, amongst others.",John Valadez: Chaos Anime,"1110 Mateo St, CA 90021",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 27 Apr  - 8 Jun 2024

Her watercolours, celebrated for their delicate complexity, not only capture abstract sensations of luminous colours and swirls but also discern the nuanced bodily imageries. Expanding on last year’s dual solo at the gallery, which delved into quantum consciousness and meditative introspection, the latest watercolour works (highlighted by Finitude Unchained In Late Spring Blossoms and Immortal Beloved) seize ephemeral moments of spiritual communion between the human and non-human protagonists, or even the presence of consciousness unbound by the physical, manifesting directly within space and time (In a Greenhouse Somewhere).The visual core of these pieces draws from symbols endemic to the microcosms of electromagnetism and molecular biology, akin to micro-landscapes probing the harmony and chaos within this internal universe. Qian’s watercolour works summon the traditions of homo signorum medical illustrations, including the Inner Canon Diagrams, the Ashmole Manuscript, and even the whimsical fruit portraits by Giuseppe Arcimboldo. In contrast, her brand new oil paintings, such as the ‘Altar’ series seen in the show, resonate with the medieval concept of memento mori, a cornerstone in the tradition of still life.Another oil painting series, ‘Portraits’, adapts techniques previously explored in her watercolor works that vividly capture the essence of the microcosmic world, now used to depict human figures as negative spaces, thus challenging the Western tradition of portrait painting.Additionally, a sculptural installation piece titled Form and Emptiness brings to the forefront Qian’s recurring fascination with exoskeletal imagery, hinting at the enigmas inherent in classical still lifes – the deceptive nature of earthly existence and the ephemeral quality of material possessions.In essence, ‘Portals to The Past’ experiments with moments of transformed states of mind. In the artist’s own words, each painting functions as a portal, inviting viewers who resonate with the painterly visions to engage in spiritual metamorphoses. Through each portal provided by the paintings, we venture into the liminal zone of our consciousness, touching base with our subconscious, or even the sentience of non- human entities. Moreover, these works reflect the artist’s ongoing pursuit of deconstructing and reconstructing our sense of time and space across diverse epistemologies, from the annals of Western science to Asian and other non-Western philosophies.Text by Zian ChenARTIST BIOGRAPHYQian Qian (b.1990, China), graduated in 2018 from MFA Fine Art in Goldsmiths, University of London.

Her works are included in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Collection, Marcelle Joseph Collection, Michael Weissman Collection and other collections.“As a visual artist, poet and mother, I explore human spirituality and transcendence in the man- made technosphere and the wider natural world. Through paintings and interactive installations, I develop a narrative and aesthetic framework combining the two seemingly distinct spheres of mythology and science.I create contemporary paintings of “ecomythticism” that delve into themes of chaos and control, consciousness and subconsciousness, constructed memory and mindfulness, interconnectedness, oneness, and touch on subjects such as transhumanism and cultural hybridity. Within my artistic repertoire, I draw from a diverse array of motifs, ranging from microscopic cells and intricate plant anatomy to expansive macroscopic galaxies and ethereal nebula clouds. I seamlessly incorporate sentient living beings alongside abstract vortexes, atoms, precise geometric forms, and symbolic imagery. I endeavor to elaborate in my works the perpetual state of flux – the fluid transmigration from fixed forms and materiality into energy, vibration or information.Inspired by a fusion of esoteric historical works, with a particular emphasis on Zen Buddhism and alchemy, as well as modern philosophical concepts like Gaia theory, Roger Pensose’s quantum consciousness, Alan Watts’s Eastern philosophy, and Erik Davis’s insightful exploration of mysticism in the age of information presented in “TechGnosis,” I intricately develop a contemporary narrative that explores the realms of spiritual-material duality through my mythopoetic sci-fi imagery. By blending chaos and control, my works portray the tension between the ethereal and the tangible. ”—Qianqian",Qian Qian: Portals to The Past,"Unit 1, The Gransden, 39 Gransden Avenue, E8 3QA",Thu-Sat 12-6pm, 2 May  - 1 Jun 2024  
Magnus Karlsson,Stockholm,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/mette-bjornberg-for-my-girls/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Mette Björnberg,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/mette-bjornberg/,"For My GirlsIt’s peculiar how the artworks for an exhibition takes shape both mentally and physically. This latest work process has progressed slowly and it has unfolded in just a few rooms, mainly in my studio and on the glass veranda of our house, but also in an old basement space beneath the bank office in Kivik, where a small gym has been set up. Being of advanced age, I go there every week in the hope of staving off death a little longer. On Sundays, I go with a friend. Over the past years, she has only a few times asked me about the progress in the studio. She knows it’s a sensitive topic and she doesn’t want to intrude. During one such rare inquiry, I found myself saying that this exhibition is dedicated to my daughters. I don’t often talk about my work, but sometimes, in a brief exchange like this, it can be clarifying to hear my own thoughts.On Thursdays, I go to the gym alone. When I’m there by myself, I occasionally get ideas for new works. They come as small and light rewards, but then take considerable time to execute. While the practical work in the studio is underway, I enjoy filling my mind with thoughts. For example, I can easily recall my father, the girls’ grandfather. He fell ill and unfortunately passed away a year or so after turning sixty. So, he was around the age I am now. He probably made peace with his fate, but I remember him being worried about me. I had a psychosis a few years earlier, and I think he feared I might fall ill again. Moreover, I was now pursuing a career as an artist. How would I manage? ”I’m sure it will be fine”, I reassured him one evening while turning on the news. That particular evening, there was a segment about careers and future prospects. It turned out that the absolute best combination at that time was to be a man and to educate oneself to become a doctor. The worst-case scenario was being a woman, choosing a career as an artist. Since my father was a doctor and I had just changed path to become an artist, the situation was quite hilarious, and we laughed for a long time. It was liberating for both of us.I belong to the frightened lot. Before school age, I didn’t really perceive myself that way. I mostly sat at home, drawing by the kitchen table, while my mother tinkered with her own crafts beside me. She provided me with pieces of cardboard and paper, and I got new colourful crayons as soon as the old ones ran out. I felt safe and encouraged. It wasn’t until I started school that my existence was shaken, and I was filled with a strong unease that I couldn’t quite put my finger on. School was supposed to be so much fun, but my voice faltered when I tried to speak in the classroom. I withdrew to avoid revealing to others how scared I was. One morning, the teacher handed out a blank sheet of white cardboard and a new box of pastel crayons to each of us, along with an instruction to draw whatever we wanted. I immediately got to work in the same way as I did at home, and soon I had drawn a large princess filling my entire sheet. She had black hair, a crown and a magnificent dress in three tiers. Red lips and rosy cheeks, ball fringe trims and ribbons. I had given her everything. She was absolutely radiant. ”You draw so beautifully”, the girl in the next bench suddenly exclaimed, standing up to get a better look. Soon, more curious classmates came forward wanting to see as well. They did not say much, but I distinctly felt that this language was helpful and empowering to me. And the children around my bench had seen with their own eyes that one should never disregard a wallflower.I work on my art in intervals. A work effort lasts a few years and is followed by a long pause. Restarting the artistic process often feels difficult and somewhat repulsive. Everything that could go wrong and all the hours of work awaiting. The doubts. Will I manage? When the work starts to flow, the safe feeling from the kitchen where I sat and drew beside my mother often returns, and the confidence I managed to muster to give life and form to the princess. It’s as if I find my way to a deep and life-giving extra breath. The unconscious probably guides me, but on the surface, thoughts flow freely as my hands gently shape the material. A piece of wood, a bit of fabric or a string of yarn.More than thirty years have passed since I sat and laughed on the couch with my dear father. He might have died again if he could see how well everything has worked out for me. Richard still by my side, three lovely daughters, a beautiful house and a studio with a stunning view. Established as an artist, but perhaps most importantly for him, a mental state without further concern. Except for still being fearful. Maybe I wouldn’t have been able to convince him regarding my art. Perhaps he would have muttered something about not understanding. But the exhibition, opening here, doesn’t primarily aim to appeal to the since long departed, and the artworks in it are not to appear as questions or answers. It’s a song I want to sing.A love song.For my girls.–Mette BjörnbergMette Björnberg was born 1963 in Gothenburg, Sweden, lives and works in Södra Mellby, Sweden.

He has developed a complex system of symbols consisting of various pictograms and colors as a means of tackling the question of the structure of the world, and with his system he aims to portray in symbols every aspect of the human condition in different combinations. Every color has a specific symbolic value attached to it. For example, green stands for material, blue for the everyday world, yellow for ideas, white and black for language and red for the subjective. The model of perception that Mullican calls the theory of the five worlds serves him as a system of order for his method of working as an artist.

He landed a part-time night job as a word processor at a Wall Street law firm, where he worked with the early use of the screen in word processing, giving him first-hand insight into the interaction between user and machine. On his off-hours, he began the exploration of how to visually convey the situation of his body interacting with the computer screen. The diversity of materials that Hsu employed (wood, vinyl cement compound, ceramic tiles, polystyrene, resin, rubber) constituted his aesthetic vocabulary at the time, bringing an unsettling sense of reality to the notion of the interface: the skin, membranes and screens where information and perception meet – or take shape.Hsu was then one of the few artists exploring the concept of human-machine hybridization. His pieces appear as if made flesh, covered with skin, embedded with architectural details (windows, ventilation grids, drain holes). The result – a sensual but injured body-like form affixed to electronic circuits – is suggestive of a metamorphosis in progress: these objects are brimming with potential and brooding with a sense of menace, as if something could burst out at any moment, or as if a transformation might take place.From the 1990s onward, Hsu starts a teaching career and withdraws from the limelight. He creates silkscreen prints on canvas before marking the dawn of the digital age by embracing Photoshop in early 2000. Abandoning his earlier practice of making art by hand, he turned to working on screen, producing works on canvas using digital imaging with wide-format printing and the use of silicone. At a time when technology is increasingly an extension of the body, the presence of machines in Hsu’s oeuvre is becoming ever vaguer and more unclear: skin and screen intermingle, merge and combine until, eventually, they become one.Exhibition curated by Lionel Bovier and Elisabeth Jobin, in collaboration with Secession, ViennaWith the support of the Pictet Group Foundation",Tishan Hsu,"10, rue des Vieux-Grenadiers, CH-1205","Tue-Fri 12-6pm, Sat-Sun 11am-6pm", 5 Mar  - 9 Jun 2024

Working on the fringes of Pop art and Minimalism in the 1960s, he developed new forms of representation with the human body as his subject.Thek came to prominence in the early 1960s for his Meat Pieces (later renamed Technological Reliquaries)—body fragments represented as chunks of flesh, sculpted from colored wax and encased in Plexiglas boxes. He showed them at Stable Gallery and Pace Gallery, two leading New York art venues of the era. But the limited recognition his work gained at home, coupled with his aversion for the US art system, prompted Thek to distance himself from American society and spend most of his time in Europe, especially Italy and the Netherlands.In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Thek produced a series of temporary, immersive, collaborative installations based around the universal and symbolic motif of the pyramid. At the same time, he rekindled his passion for drawing and painting, which remained central to his practice until his death from AIDS in 1988.Between 1969 and 1975, Thek spent part of each year on the Italian island of Ponza. The experience opened his eyes to the possibility of a simple life of both ecstasy and pantheism, which inspired a series of paintings on newspaper representing the infinite expanse of the ocean and the natural elements, reflecting a sense of reconnection with the origins of creation. In the 1980s, Thek’s paintings captured his growing interest in mysticism, nurtured during frequent retreats at monasteries in Vermont. A spiritual and deeply religious man, he was heavily influenced by the mystic writings of Saint Augustine and Meister Eckhart, among others.Switzerland played a prominent role in bringing Thek’s work to a wider audience, with the artist receiving support from Harald Szeemann and Jean-Christophe Ammann. However, his pieces have not been exhibited in a Swiss museum since 1996, when the traveling show Paul Thek: The Wonderful World that Almost Was was hosted at the Migros Museum of Contemporary Art and the Kunsthalle in Zurich.The current exhibition at MAMCO adds a new chapter to this history, taking a fresh look at the work of this unique figure of US counterculture, whose art defies classification. It features a representative selection of Thek’s pieces from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, showcasing the diverse forms of expression—sculpture, painting, drawing, and engraving—that characterized his artistic practice. The exhibition explores the indivisible link between the body and the spirit, between the sacred and the profane, between nature and technology, between life and death—the very oppositions that permeate Thek’s art and make his unparalleled body of work a form of initiation journey.Exhibition curated by Valérie Da Costa, in collaboration with Françoise Ninghetto",Paul Thek,"10, rue des Vieux-Grenadiers, CH-1205","Tue-Fri 12-6pm, Sat-Sun 11am-6pm", 5 Mar  - 9 Jun 2024

In 1945, she arrived in Switzerland as a war refugee. She studied at the Zurich School of Art and Design before having to emigrate to New York in 1950, where she worked as a goldsmith. The patterns and motifs that were staples of Pedretti’s trade would appear time and again in a body of work spanning more than seven decades. She developed a special interest in fish and birds, which fascinated her on account of both their freedom of movement and the natural elements—water and air—through which they moved. Over the years, Pedretti developed an artistic practice marked by hybridization: bodies and beings (animals, plants, humans, and celestial creatures) imbued with allusions to notions of otherness and exile.Pedretti returned to Switzerland in 1952, settling in the Canton of Graubünden. She married Swiss painter Gian Pedretti, with whom she would go on to have five children. In the 1960s, she steadily renounced working with metal in favor of paper, producing series of often narrative etchings based around the motif of the angel. Pedretti’s art is indissociable from her work as a writer, which had its origins in her childhood. She pursued both passions in parallel, reflecting her inclination for splitting her attention, without distinction, across multiple projects at once. Although Pedretti’s art was exhibited in several solo shows in Switzerland (Bern in 1975, Solothurn in 1976, Schaffhausen in 1981), it tended to be eclipsed by her prolific writings. She became one of the most widely read authors in Switzerland, publishing numerous articles, radio dramas, and novels.In the late 1970s, the family moved to La Neuveville in the Canton of Bern, where Pedretti began producing sculptures in her large studio. Her output from this period included Objets à suspendre, a series of fragile, hollow objects that she displayed hanging from the ceiling. These pieces were formed from a wire frame, onto which Pedretti applied plaster, acrylic, feathers, and impregnated fabric in a manner suggestive of bones, membranes, skin, scales, and wings. Fish- and bird-like features blended into one another, although these objects were without exception in a state of suspension. At the same time, Pedretti experimented with pen and pencil drawings on paper, creating intricate patterns—meshes, twists, and turns with an organic quality—interspersed with beaks, shells, plants, and eyes. This surreal quality soon transposed to her sculptures: vast wings, measuring several meters across, covered with latex-stiffened fabric—Pedretti shared a fascination for latex with Swiss artist Heidi Bucher, her contemporary. Veined with bamboo and wire, these flexible, translucent wings appear as if torn from a being, taking on a life of their own. Some were intended to be displayed outdoors, in parks and other public spaces, where they would wear out over time until their ultimate destruction.Pedretti’s hanging objects form the core of the MAMCO exhibition, which looks back at the artist’s experimentation with different materials in the latter half of the 1970s, along with her interest in the hybridization of beings and shapes.Curated by Elisabeth JobinWith the support of Pro Helvetia, Fondation suisse pour la culture, Oertli Stiftung, and the Municipalité de la Neuveville",Erica Pedretti,"10, rue des Vieux-Grenadiers, CH-1205","Tue-Fri 12-6pm, Sat-Sun 11am-6pm", 5 Mar  - 9 Jun 2024

After teaching himself philosophy and geometric drawing, he went on to study classical art at the Nicolae Grigorescu Academy of Fine Arts. He then spent some time traveling and exhibiting his works within the Soviet Union and later in Western Europe. In 1970, Neagu moved permanently to London with the help of Scottish curator Richard Demarco. Alongside his work as a practicing artist, Neagu taught at several of the city’s art schools, where his students included Anish Kapoor, Rachel Whiteread, Tony Cragg, and Marc Camille Chaimowicz.Before settling in the UK, Neagu developed a deliberately restrictive sculptural practice, using a narrow range of inexpensive materials such as matchboxes, cardboard, wood, and leather to create a series of box-like structures, some of which were hinged. These pieces were exhibited in the streets of Bucharest, as captured in the 1969 film Neagu’s Boxes. In his Palpable Art Manifesto, published in Edinburgh in 1969 and inspired by his anthroposophical readings, Neagu set out the theoretical principles that would inform his future practice—a vision of art that is experienced with the five senses and that calls for humans to be at one with their environment. This approach is reflected in his Anthropocosmos series: honeycombed grid patterns divide the sensitive parts of the human body—fingers, hands, lips, ears, breasts—or, sometimes, the entire body, into hollow, rectangular cells.Overlaid with a geometric grid in this way, the human figure becomes part of a system that Neagu named the “Generative Art Code,” reflecting his belief that our philosophical and social experiences are shaped by the dynamic interplay between three different aspects of our existence: our primal instincts (represented by the triangle), the order and rationality of Cartesian society (the rectangle), and the self-revelation that comes when we are freed from the shackles of norms and constraints (the circle). This emancipation can only be achieved through movement: jumping, dancing, and “going tornado”—a recurring theme in Neagu’s work. In 1972, having laid these theoretical foundations, Neagu established the Generative Art Group, a collective in whose name he signed a catalog and a number of works despite being the only non-fictitious member. The other four members, who were each given a name and a backstory, represented individual parts of a greater whole.The most pivotal decade of Neagu’s career started in the early 1970s. His works were exhibited three times—in 1972, 1976 and 1981—at the Rivolta gallery in Lausanne, with which he had a close personal relationship. For each of those shows Neagu took a holistic approach, also designing the decor and staging elements. The exhibition at MAMCO features a substantial body of engravings and drawings produced by Neagu for the Lausanne-based gallery, as well as a collection of archive documents provided by the Rivolta family. It pays tribute to a singular artist who preferred to stay out of the limelight but who, in his own unassuming way, made a lasting impact on the European art scene.Exhibition curated by Elisabeth JobinWith the support of the Rivolta gallery archives and The Paul Neagu Estate (UK)",Paul Neagu,"10, rue des Vieux-Grenadiers, CH-1205","Tue-Fri 12-6pm, Sat-Sun 11am-6pm", 5 Mar  - 9 Jun 2024  
MAMOTH,London,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/suyi-xu/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Suyi Xu,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/suyi-xu/,"Through a visual language of organic shape and linear structure, Suyi Xu creates a dialogue between the built world and wonder in nature. Her paintings bridge inner and outer worlds. The devotional architecture of gates, cathedrals and cloisters holds intuitive, often mirrored, line and shade patterns of symmetry like butterflies or pine cones, shells or vulvas – references that run like a beam through the history of Western art and Eastern philosophies. Trained as an art historian at Barnard College in New York and then as a painter at the School of Visual Arts, Suyi’s research is deeply embedded in the tradition of painting. Her fascination with light is rooted in the transcendent brushstrokes of Rembrandt and the Dutch school as well as the visual vernacular of mystic painters orthe Color Field movement. Shape and form emerge from the picture plane, buttressed by pillars or skeletons of buildings. These elements are lifted from a variety of reference imagery often sourced from books held in large collections like Gemäldegalerie in Berlin or the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, institutions that are themselves fortresses of architecture and power. Raised as a strict atheist in Shanghai, Suyi is careful to suggest she does not adhere to any religious doctrine or institutional dogma, but that she is interested in what these have produced through the harnessing of belief, and how this manifests in a visual medium. The work of Proust, for example, is not about religion, rebirth and resurrection, yet his writing has that as its spine, she explains. For Suyi, the search is for a form of grace as described by Simone Weil – the grace present in a moment of awe and wonder on a rare spellbinding encounter with art, music or nature: the sacred encounter.Vaulted ceilings in muted hues, subtly glowing spheres and seductive patterns unfurl across immaculate linen canvases. The space rendered by Suyi echoes sacred geometry, as in The Room of Apparitions 2 (all works 2024) , where layered forms become mandalas or lotuses in the subjective eye of the beholder. In The Room of Columns arches become lids, lips or gems. Suyi’s washed-out palette gives a sense of the low-contrast, soft-focus, liminal state between dreaming and waking. The works are apparitions from the light of the mind’s eye. This collection could be, and even feels like, paintings that might be used as tools to assist in achieving transcendence. The artist sees them as her unconscious realms, and recognises her process as echoing the dreamer’s journey in an associative ‘dream-logic’ arrived at through a chance process. The images are subtle and calm: a reverent silence is embedded in the canvas, somehow an antidote to what she refers to as the chaos of New York.Suyi begins her day by intention-setting and mental preparation as she walks to her Brooklyn studio, seeking solace and solitude through the process of making. On arrival at the studio, she first sweeps the floor. In many cultures, sweeping is a physical gesture and a metaphor for cleaning the mental debris away, making space for contemplation or trance. The previous day she will have turned her canvases away from her to face the wall. This glimpse – or reveal – first thing in the morning is the time she values most in the day: when she sees the canvases anew. Once she has observed them, she then warms up – as one might at the start of a run or a dance – training her hand and eye by beginning some simple sketches of reference imagery from art and architecture. Dropping into a flow state and a meditative process means that as she starts back onher canvas and lets the white pencil glide across the primed linen, she is being guided by her focus and her hand rather than any pre-emptive composition.‘It is not pleasurable to forge your own drawings,’ she explains. As a result, this presence and responsiveness seem to keep the compositions alive. Her perfect ratio and balance is a natural by-product process, as she works through her ‘projected psyche’. Her unconscious walks her through room after room, like a dream in which there is a first-person traveller, and time and space are internal, only present when felt or observed. In this way, she creates a story-like lucidity, where the main character is either absent, or present in the body of the viewer.The body of work is distinctive in its rendering of soft, silent worlds in which the figure is absent and yet hinted at in bodily shape and form. In The Room of Coronation , the picture plane is foreground and background simultaneously. This interplay between spatial arrangements is also evident in The Room of Temperance , which – as with all balancing acts – is a mirror composition. At the centre the entrance also becomes a protrusion. Like Magic Eye pictures or optical illusion silhouettes, if you soften your gaze enough two images can be focused between. This trick-of-the-eye of perceptual state also echoes the in-between. Through her work, Suyi combines the formal harmony of expertly honed painterly work, with the appealing ability to invite us into her world.Text by Susanna Davies - Crook",Suyi Xu: Apparitions,"3 Endsleigh Street, WC1H 0DS",Wed-Sat 12-6pm, 17 May  - 22 Jun 2024

In this sense, the work suggests the protection of the uterus at various levels and from various perspectives. In the first instance, through exuberant native vegetation, the artist approaches sculptures related to the procreative female womb, which unfold into seeds containing life; from another place, these structures appear contained and limited by the walls of the museum's outer courtyard. In a broader vision, this landscape, in constant movement, is created concerning the five great mountain ranges surrounding the city, turning concatenated systems into the central disruptive axis of the proposal.The recurring selection of materials in Adeline's artistic practice, such as marble, gravel, and vegetation, seems to be discursively related to the vulnerability of the human body. Hence, the author has titled this exhibition under the French term Enceinte, which refers both to the action of ""bringing life inside the womb"" and to the space inside a container, in this case, directed towards the heart of the building. Finally, it is important to specify the synergies of layers that stand out in this project: the city, the museum, the sculpture garden, the vegetation, and the seeds – sculptural elements – seem to reinforce the feminist position of Monseignat, who makes this visual universe around human creation.- Taiyana Pimentel",Adeline de Monseignat: ENCEINTE,"Juan Zuazua, Padre Raymundo Jardón y, Centro, 64000",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 30 May  - 11 Aug 2024

Over half a century and more than 400 solo exhibitions later, Cragg has established himself as one of the most influential sculptors working today, widely recognized for his lifelong fascination and virtuosity with materials. Marian Goodman Gallery has had the honor of representing Cragg for over forty years and is thrilled to bring this new exhibition of his work to Los Angeles.A significant presentation of works will be shown throughout the galleries, lobby, and garden, demonstrating the formal, material, and emotive range of sculpture that Cragg has been working on since 2018. As is distinctive of his oeuvre, these works are the outcome of a profound and restless fascination with material properties. Cragg works to capture the emotion, meaning, and beauty of a material, as well as the rational structure that is used to express its form beyond its modern utilitarian principles. As seen across the exhibition, the artist notably works in ‘families’ of sculpture—continuously inventing new forms in series that often share a single title. His works encourage us to think sculpturally, to consider material as an extension of the self.“For Tony Cragg, an engagement with material is an investigation into seeing beneath and beyond the surface of all things. In an epoch of information overload …. we are caught between the production of a flattened universe, where the forms we encounter are geometrically dull and predictable, and a materially active universe, where we are engaged with the structural and voluminous dynamics of all kinds of phenomena. What we believe to be seeing and what is happening at a microscopic level, that is between the world of surface impressions and the world of material engagements, is part of Cragg’s continued practice.” (from Thinking Sculpturally in Tony Cragg: A Rare Category of Objects)Cragg’s Hedge (2023) is from a series based originally on the artist’s childhood memory of playing in the hedgerows found in the English countryside. These Corten works take the literal form of a single or double hedge, which, at once organic and landscaped, is conveyed as a lively, interwoven tangle of rounded planes of steel. Proposing a counter-narrative to steel’s industrial past, the sculpture, with its lyrical nature, offers an entirely new strain of organic forms in Cragg’s work.The anthropomorphic Senders (2019) anticipates the interlocked forms of the Integers (2022) and the stratified layers of Masks (2021) whose forms summon an ancient and contemporary past. The new black Masks (2023), made from stacked planes of bog oak wood compressed to form striations of rounded strata, resembles organic structures, expressing its material substance in constructive form.Accumulations and communities of forms are often present in Cragg’s work, as evidenced in the work In No Time (2018) a wood sculpture made of abstracted forms in aggregate turning variably along an axis. Cragg’s interest in geological forms and his strategies of stratification, layering, and compilation can be seen here as well as in the nearby bronze Stack (2020). Similarly, the parity between a sculptural object and rocky landscape is evoked in the stone works, Off the Mountain (2023).In a complementary method, Versus (2023), a brilliant sculpture in bronze in a seemingly arrested state of movement, utilizes numerous patterned forms to radiate the energy of shifting profiles or jagged bodies in motion. This assemblage of dynamic elements expresses the significance of constituent parts to a whole, as well as the nature of mutability and the human experience. Versus plays on perceived realities, and represents a transient world in flux.The Incident works (2022-3) comprise a newer series that has recently provided a great fascination for the artist. Exclusively made in both Corten and stainless steel, they draw from the industrial, dominant presence of these materials in our built environment, but intrinsically resist their legacy of pre-formatted materials. In the Incidents, Cragg deliberately subverts our experience of them through vibrant, organic, and gravity-resisting forms that embody energy and verticality, and a free range of expression.The newest forms, Untitled (2023) in Corten steel and stainless steel, represent the exploration of a silhouette, or a profile that enlarges and expands into space on a human scale. As a sculptural form, it expresses a large volume outside of itself which becomes an extension of ourselves or can be seen as a tangible object.On view will be several works on paper from 2009-2021. For Cragg, drawing is an essential activity, often existing autonomously from the practice of sculpture, as a daily process or the expression of a concrete idea. Drawing allows visualization of a complex material world, or can be a step into the unknown. As Cragg says, “In contrast to sculpture, drawing never demands a real world scenario. Drawing steps into the world of dreams. ”The artist currently has a solo exhibition, Please Touch!, on view at Museum Kunstpalast Düsseldorf through 26 May 2024. Upcoming projects include a forthcoming exhibition at Castle Howard, UK, in early May which will be on view through September 2024.Tony Cragg was born in Liverpool, England, and has lived and worked in Wuppertal, Germany, since 1977.

Marian Goodman,Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/rendez-vous-no1/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Marian-Goodman-Gallery-Paris-1.jpg,,,"From the street, through the window of the 66 space, the sculptural cloud of Portrait (The Concept-Artist Smoking Head, Stand-In) (2016) by Nairy Baghramian invites visitors to discover the exhibition. The title of the photograph echoes the artist's reflection on the political potential of sculpture, which, through its formal and material characteristics and its specificities of presentation, embodies theoretical ideas and principles.At the entrance of the space, the photograph Makunaíma (1971) by Lothar Baumgarten features another portrait; that of a figure from Amerindian mythology, embodied by the artist himself wearing a cardboard mask topped with feathers. This mythical figure, known to Baumgarten through the writings of ethnologist Theodor Koch-Grünberg, enabled him to explore the concepts of identity and otherness.The sculpture Clara 1 (2018) is emblematic of the synthesis operatedin Leonor Antunes' work, in which natural materials and artisanal techniques draw inspiration from prominent figures, particularly female, of modernism in architecture and design to create a reinterpretation of sculpture. The work in teak wood and cotton cord pays subtle homage to Cuban-born designer Clara Porset (1895-1981).With Untitled (Somalia/L'Ange de mer, L'Hydre ou Serpent Marin, Le Marteau, La Tête du Marteau séparée du Corps) (2022), Anri Sala proposes an unprecedented encounter between an 18th-century engraving and an abstract drawing he made in ink and pastel. The diptych, part of the Untitled (Map/Species) (2018-2022) series, premiered at the Rotonde de la Bourse de Commerce in Paris, alongside the presentation of his film Time No Longer.It's a romantic rendezvous that Annette Messager's work suggests, except that in Les amoureux (2016), small, intertwined dolls wrapped in black aluminum foil, hang from a butcher's hook. Emblematic of the small assemblages she creates with a variety of materials, the sculpture evokes the duality of the amorous relationship, both comforting and dangerous.Longtime friends Tacita Dean and Julie Mehretu collaborated on a major installation in 2018 entitled Monotype Melody (ninety works for Marian Goodman), in which they each created 45 monotypes, including Found Postcard Monoprint (Wolverine Mine) and Monotype #16. While Dean enhances an old postcard with color, Mehretu draws her singular marks in black ink and spray.Giovanni Anselmo's interest in the Earth's force of gravity and energy, in our connection with the cosmos, and in the boundary between the visible and the invisible, the finite and the infinite, infuses his entire practice. His monochrome graphite drawing on paper Particolare del lato in alto della prima I di Infinito (1975) reveals a 'visible and measurable detail' of the concept of infinity, in the form of a fragment of the letter 'i'.Niele Toroni's work/painting delivers no message; for the artist, what's important is what's on view: n°50 imprints repeated at regular 30 cm intervals. Applied not on a monochrome support but on the pages of an Italian sports gazette, the imprints are intended to re-actualize our visual experience, since according to the painter, each n°50 brushprint is never the same. For Toroni, painting is first and foremost an ""apprenticeship in vision.""Renowned for his sculptures and installations that use the physical presence of light to investigate the elusive nature of language and perception, in 2019 Cerith Wyn Evans creates the limited edition, T=R=A=N=S (plane). Its circular void cut into a stretched canvas directs the subtle interplay of light and shadow towards an immaterial drawing projected onto the wall. A deceptively simple device, the void becomes a floating chiaroscuro that animates the monochrome work, in a renewed way on each edition.Through his work, Adrián Villar Rojas explores the conditions of a humanity on the brink of extinction, tracing the boundaries of a post-anthropocene time turned in on itself, in which past, present and future converge. The work on paper From the series La fin de l'imagination (VI) (2020) was conceived from drawings of posters from his past exhibitions, which after being folded, crumpled, covered or enhanced with colored pigments, modified with pan-human stencils, are transformed into a hybrid image, political propaganda or battle flag of a futuristic conflict.For Giulio Paolini, the ""act of exhibition"" can be likened to a rendezvous, in which the works on display constitute a visual narrative that visitors are invited to follow in the same way as the artist himself. Paolini's Per Oscar Wilde (2017) perfectly focuses his aesthetics and thinking on art and its representation, on the figure of the artist and the viewer's gaze. In his complex composition in homage to Oscar Wilde, Paolini borrows and fragments the image of the painting A Private View at The Royal Academy (1881) by William Powell Frith, which depicts a social visit to the museum in Victorian times; the author of The Portrait of Dorian Gray is identified among the visitors.Interested above all in the unpredictable nature of photography, James Welling has been involved since the outset in a variety of investigations into materiality, abstraction, spatiality and color, the latter playing a central role in his work since his first chromatic experiments in the 1970s.

Since 2019 he has been able to enter the various sites of CERN, the world's largest particle physics center, located on either side of the French-Swiss border near Geneva.On the first floor of the gallery, several meter-long photographs reveal monumental scientific structures that constitute CERN's Prévessin-Moëns and Meyrin sites. Beam Line Zone 1, Beam Line Zone 2 and ProtoDUNE, each detail infrastructures in Hall EHN1 (Experimental Hall North area 1), the organization's largest building. These panoramic immersive views show complex, visually unintelligible structures that resemble immense technological “landscapes.” Their characteristics and colors are almost reminiscent of sculptural installations. Marked by the absence of any humanity – reminiscent of the deserted New York City streets Struth photographed in the 1970s - these constructions are nonetheless the product of human genius. Like the cathedrals of their day, they represent one of mankind’s greatest technological achievements, enabling us to investigate the origins of the universe.On the lower level of the gallery, works that capture the intricacies of CERN’s mechanisms, such as Magnet 2 and X-ray Telescope, are shown in counterpoint to the Containers series, originally scattered throughout CERN's various halls, and recently the subject of interest to the artist. In contrast to the imposing infrastructures presented on the first floor, these pictures, taken from an omniscient perspective, are smaller in scale and represent remnants of technological discovery. Within the containers, materials and objects are layered, having been temporarily discarded, for potential reuse in future experiments. This random detritus, taken out of context by Struth, becomes an ordered composition that frames the accumulations as if they were artworks in themselves.In the final room of the exhibition, the CERN works give way to Animals, another group of photographs taken at the Leibniz Institute for Wildlife and Zoo Research (IZW) in Berlin, where Struth has been visiting regularly since 2016. The IZW's mission is to study the diversity and evolution of the world's wildlife, both free-living and captive, and in particular the anthropogenic impact on species and their ecosystems. Once again, Struth points his lens at activities little known to the public: the laboratory's researchers, just hours after the natural death of an animal, methodically dissect it to analyze the causes of its demise. Each work shows, against a solemn dark gray background, an animal's remains before dissection, like a prelude to a kind of ritual. These post-mortem photographs, with their painterly aesthetic, follow in the long tradition of memento mori: ""I've tried to represent animals in a beautiful and dignified way. I'm interested in the idea of abandonment: once you die, the whole circus you proactively create, the theater, comes to a complete halt. These images should be like punches, the memory of death like a wake-up call."" But the subject of the series is not just the death of the animal; as the state of the brain, photographed just after it has been removed, underscores, it is the way in which the science of our Anthropocene era seizes upon this death for the purposes of study that is at the core of Struth's reflections.Thomas Struth, born 1954 in Geldern, Germany, lives and works in Berlin. He studied at the Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf. Recent comprehensive exhibitions of his work include Figure Ground, his largest show to date, which was presented at Haus der Kunst in 2017 in Munich before traveling to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in 2019, as well as Nature & Politics presented successively at the Folkwang Museum in Essen, the Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin, the High Museum in Atlanta, the Moody Center for the Arts in Houston, the St. Louis Museum of Art and the MAST Foundation in Bologna between 2016 and 2019.Recently, Struth has had solo exhibitions at the Hilti Art Foundation, Vaduz, Lichtenstein (2019), Aspen Museum of Art, United States (2018) and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2014). The major retrospective Photographs 1978-2010 traveled from Kunsthaus Zürich (2010) to K20 Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf (2011) and from Whitechapel Gallery, London (2012) to Museu Serralves, Porto (2011-2012). His photographs have also toured the world in international group shows, including Capturing the moment at Tate Modern London (2023/2024) and … et labora at Fondation Vincent van Gogh in Arles (2019/2020), among others.

Marian Goodman Gallery,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/giuseppe-penone-hands-earth-light-colors/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Giuseppe Penone,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/giuseppe-penone/,"Shaped by a conceptual movement in the 1960s and 1970s that sought to ground art in everyday materials, Penone has worked in a distinctive realm within the tradition of arte povera with a unique body of work that prioritizes process, time, phenomena, the body and nature as sculptural materials, offering a continuous reinterpretation of these forms and their meaning.On view will be a selection of key photographic works, sculptures, and recent works on canvas which span the years 1970-2023, highlighting a conceptual theme that has propelled his practice and continues to resonate today. Central to this is the notion of touch and its importance to the artist: ""to touch, understand a form, an object is like covering it with prints. A trace formed by the images that I have on my hands,"" wrote Penone in 1969. Beyond the conventions of sight, the imprint for Penone is touch transformed into a fossilized gesture that records and shapes our reality and our perceptions. An index of the individual it is simultaneously unique and ""the most democratic image that can be conveyed -- an image that leads human beings back to matter, to nature."" Touch and breath, forms which belong to everyone, transmute the tactile into the visual, underlying Penone's notion of living sculpture.A point of departure in this exhibition is an early sculpture from 1979-82 titled Cocci (Shards), which traces the imprint of the artist's cupped hands holding a fragmented vessel, preserved through poured plaster. These solidified forms delineate both the residual shards of a vessel and the shape of the artist cupping his hands around it, reminiscent of the primordial gesture of trying to keep hold of what is fluid.Inspired by the gestures and actions in Cocci, two decades later in 2004-05, Penone undertook a similar process: creating larger plaster shapes tracing the imprint of the hand, substituting children's wooden blocks for vessel fragments, and casting the blocks into steel. With the plaster shapes in bronze, and the wooden blocks in steel, Geometria nelle mani (Geometry in the Hands), 2005, was created. A series of five sculptures on view here, they contain a memory of Cocci. Their seemingly natural bronze surfaces resemble human imprints and are juxtaposed with stainless steel geometries, creating a dialectic of forms. Within each of the sculptures lies a hidden complexity: a small void of the same shape as the wooden block through which we're able to glimpse the artist's hand - the principle of creation at the heart of Penone's practice.In a group of early works from 1970-1973, Coincidenza di immagini (Images Coincidence) and Svolgere la propria pelle (To Unroll One's Skin), photographs of a part of the body correlate to ink prints of their respective skin areas establishing a relationship between the visual representation and the perception of touch, and revealing the richness of the image of the skin. These works suggest that the physical encounter with the universe is more profound than the experience of it through sight.Trattenere 6, 8, 12, 16 anni di crescita (To Retain 6,8,12,16 Years of Growth), 2004-2020, is a cast in bronze of a hand grasping the trunk of a young tree, retaining a hold upon it even as the tree continues to grow around it for six, eight, twelve, sixteen years. From his first works, Alpi Marittime in 1968, for Penone the tree retains a memory of an action over time, giving life to the relationship between forms and the the imprint of the hand within a sculpture.Installed on the wall and suspended by a steel cable are the works from Avvolgere la terra - il colore nelle mani (To Enfold the Earth – the colour of the hands), 2014, each formed by enlarging a handful of clay bearing the imprint of the artist's hands, and revealing that imprint in terracotta and pigments of red, light pink, blue, and yellow.In his most recent works, a series titled Impronte di Luce (Imprints of Light), 2023, Penone turns to painting, exploring gesture and imprint in an entirely new context. In each of these works gestures of the hands imprinted on paper with ink are enlarged and transported onto canvas to create colorful compositions. The brilliantly hued colors of the background of the canvases are derived from Le Corbusier's 'architectural polychromy,' a chromatic palette of 63 colors formulated in 1931 and enriched in 1959. Each canvas has the proportions of a 183 x 183 cm perfect square, inspired by the 'Modulor,' Le Corbusier's anthropometric system of proportions and measurements based on the golden ratio.Resembling both imprints of bodies and abstract shapes, the dancing forms that emerge on these canvases appear anthropomorphic and vegetal. The inspiration for Impronte di Luce was an exhibition at the priory of Couvent de la Tourette, France in 2022, in which Penone responded to the original skin of Le Corbusier's building with a series of frottage drawings tracing the grain of wood in the walls, again interpreting them in the context of Corbusier's architecture and color scheme. The rubbings of the building anticipate the current works on view, reimagining them in a related palette and new form as gestures of the body: ""The imprint reveals the golden ratio that I have in my hands,"" says Penone.Giuseppe Penone was born in Garessio, Italy in 1947. He lives and works in Turin. Giuseppe Penone has had recent solo exhibitions at the Galleria Borghese, Rome (2023); Centre Pompidou, Paris (2022); Philadelphia Museum of Art (2022); Villa Medici, Rome (2021); Palais d'léna - CESE, Paris, France (2019); Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Wakefield, UK (2018); Chateau La Coste, Le Puy-Sainte-Réparade (2017); Palazzo della Civilità, Rome (2017); Louvre Abu Dhabi, UAE (2017); MART, Rovereto (2016); Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (2016); Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas (2015); Musée Cantonal des Beaux-Arts, Lausanne, Switzerland (2015); the Beirut Art Center, Lebanon (2014); the Musée de Grenoble, France (2014); the Château de Versailles, France (2013); Kunstmuseum Winterthur (2013); Madison Square Park, New York (2013) and Whitechapel Gallery, London (2013).In 2023 Penone became a Foreign Associate Member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. Among his many awards he recently received the McKim Medal (2017) and the prestigious Praemium Imperiale International Arts Award for Sculpture in 2014. Giuseppe Penone has exhibited at Documenta V (1972), VII (1982), VIII (1987) and XIII (2012) and at the Venice Biennale in 1978, 1980, 1986, 1995, and 2007.Earlier this year The Logic of the Vegetal - Metamorphosis was presented at Desert X AlUla 2024 located in northwest Saudi Arabia.

Each of the works presented is articulated through oil on canvas. In recent years, however, Eder’s subject matter – in particular, his depictions of female nudes as a male painter in 2024—has been subject to controversy. Beyond the dialogue raised by his depiction of the nude, Eder’s work presents an absurd series of themes portrayed through a disarming aura of kitsch: cats (both demonic and allegorical), toy poodles, and male nudes, for example. The subjects often inhabit landscapes that oscillate between late-capitalist nightmares and antiquity.In these paintings, one finds countless references to academic painters of bygone centuries whose proclivities and desires have been effaced by museums, high auction prices, and countless scholars. And while one could easily begin to unravel the desires of the painter, it is important to note that these works also serve, and are activated by the viewer’s own desires. Ultimately, DETOX is comprised of the panoply of images commonly found on the Internet today, functioning more as a mirror than a depiction. The question remains: should this body of work be excluded or presented within gallery walls today?Many in our field would agree that art galleries serve as arbiters of artistic taste and influence, constantly—and to various degrees of subtlety—manipulating an otherwise fickle and unpredictable industry and market. Throughout its long history, Marlborough has mounted exhibitions and represented artists that were considered controversial in their time. Not only have these artists' works endured, but they are now recognized as significant within both the history of commercial art galleries and broader Art History.With DETOX, perhaps we are then left to contemplate: why should a gallery host an exhibition whose sole purpose is to challenge taste? We leave it to our audience to decide.",Martin Eder: DETOX,"545 West 25th Street, NY 10001",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 30 Apr  - 29 Jun 2024

Freud’s approach to printmaking was informed by his painting; by placing the etching plate upright on an easel, he was able to meticulously work from life. Always working directly from his models and demarcating their forms through meticulous networks of finely etched lines. Unsettling and unyielding, these portraits contain a remarkable honesty and an awkwardness that adds to the psychological tension.Francis Bacon’s graphic works reflect his relentless strive to “open the valves of feeling.” He acted as a self-proclaimed witness of mankind, setting himself the task of scrutinizing the human condition. Whether self-portraits, depictions of former lovers, or evocations of the human figure, each produces the same expressive and fiercely charged effect seen in his paintings. He worked closely with his printmakers to capture the same color quality, especially evident in the bright oranges and deep blacks.Bacon and Freud shared an impassioned, yet tumultuous, nearly forty-year friendship. When the pair met in the mid-1940s through their mutual friend Graham Sutherland, they quickly struck up a friendship and became inseparable, often seeing each other daily. The two would frequently partake in debaucherous activities, spending time at the Gargoyle Club (and later the Colony Room) gambling, drinking, and fraternizing with fellow bohemians, which on one occasion, lead Freud to competitively gamble away everything he owned, including his car.Their friendship was also fueled by their mutual interest in their own and each other’s art practice. Freud deeply admired Bacon’s work and was struck with the distinct emotive qualities and rawness of the human form. When Freud sat for Bacon in 1951, he was moved by the artist’s spontaneous, hurried approach to artmaking. Conversely, when Freud drew Bacon the following year, Bacon was astonished by the level of detail and time Freud invested in the piece.In the studio, the two shared a complex relationship, with Bacon and Freud fiercely critiquing, whilst inspiring, one another’s work. While Bacon encouraged Freud to break away from traditional modes of portraiture, Freud motivated Bacon to tap into his subject’s psyche and explore the emotional depths of his sitters. As Freud recounted, “I realized immediately that [Bacon’s] work related to how he felt about life. Mine on the other hand seemed very labored. That was because there was a terrific amount of labor for me to do anything—and still is. Francis on the other hand, would have ideas, which he put down and then destroy and then quickly put down again. It was his attitude that I admired. The way he was completely ruthless about his own work. I think that Francis’s way of painting freely helped me feel more daring.”",Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud: Conversations,"545 West 25th Street, NY 10001",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 30 Apr  - 29 Jun 2024

Her portraits capture moments of everyday life and an expanded female experience. Starkey reveals women in moments of private reflection or social interaction that might otherwise go unseen, the large scale of her images offering monumentality to these instances.“You are very aware as a young woman that you are the observed, and you are expected to perform for the eye”, Starkey comments, “we’re conditioned to the point where we observe ourselves being observed, and we operate out of that language, or those dynamics. My work is a way of speaking to women about how you don’t always need to perform for the gaze, that there is more to being female than being seen.” 1In her carefully choregraphed scenes, Starkey works intimately with the women she photographs, discussing composition and poses with the sitters, continually showing them the image to establish their approval of the work. This is to overcome what she terms “the camera’s consuming eye”, acknowledging the hierarchical potential inherent within the act of photographing someone. Untitled, January 2023 shows young women photographing each other; the work was taken during her collaboration with female students from Wakefield’s CAPA College, an initiative in which Starkey created a space of empathy and joy as a salve to the damage digital manipulation is inflicting on self-perception.These works stagger the viewer’s access to the women through Starkey’s use of glass and reflections. The subjects are shown through windows and mirrors, a process which forces the eye to slow down in its comprehension of the scene. She observed “I wanted to bring the female form to that state where it is fragmented and broken up... constructing the image so that it was harder to deconstruct, blocking the consuming eye”. 2 In the self-portraits, Starkey appears in the reflection of splintered mirrors, placing herself behind the gaze of the camera lens whilst equally becoming its subject. The act of turning the lens onto herself equally mimes the increasing prevalence and potence of self-representation spurred on by the relentless proliferation of images of ourselves within social media.Hannah Starkey (b. 1971, Belfast), lives and works in London.

The collective bases their works on literary texts, recognising the emancipation to be found in the process of reading. They often work directly onto the pages of found books or sheet music that they adhere in a grid to the surface of a canvas or board. Standing for ‘Kids of Survival’, Studio K.O.S. began as a community initiative for teenagers in the South Bronx led by Tim Rollins (b. 1955, Pittsfield, USA, d. 2017, New York, USA). The current members started with the group between the ages of 12 and 16. Many of the participants in his program were dyslexic, making the collective acutely aware that reading is not a neutral activity but rather a complex process with numerous barriers to access.An artist, teacher, and activist, Rollins taught at the Intermediate School 52 in the Bronx and sought to use the consumption and discussion of literature as an active part of art production. Initially called Tim Rollins and K.O.S., the collective changed their name following Rollins’ death in 2017 and they continue to honour his legacy. The group upholds his work in education, initiating workshops with school and university students as part of their artistic production.The Scarlet Letter / All About Love (after Nathaniel Hawthorne and bell hooks), 2023The Scarlet Letter is an 1850 book by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Set in the 17th century, the novel follows Hester Prynne, a woman who conceived a daughter out of wedlock and was forced to wear a scarlet letter “A” for adultery. Prynne transforms this symbol meant to be her shame, isolation, and ridicule into power, subversion, and self-acceptance. Abreu observed, “Shame can undermine the ability for embracing self-love. This is at the crux of hooks’ All About Love. Despite having been published 150 years apart, the intersections in both texts are relevant and powerful. They revolve around self-love, defiance, and transcendence through the sincere practice of loving”. This series was made in collaboration with the University of Massachusetts and Upward Bound High School. In this workshop, participants studied hooks’ text, writing down words that resonated with them. “We listened to one another read aloud. In essence, we invited the spirits of bell hooks and Nathanial Hawthorne to join in our collaborative effort. Using the scarlet of Hester Prynne, each participant took the first letter of one of those words and reclaimed their meaning. All to practise self-love” – Angel Abreu, 2024.A Midsummer Night's Dream (after Shakespeare and Mendelssohn), 2023These works draw from Shakespeare’s fantastical play A Midsummer Night’s Dream, drawing on workshops conducted throughout the last decade. Decorated with colourful “flowers”, these forms serve as physical manifestations of Puck’s power. In Act II, Oberon declares “Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once: / The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid / Will make or man or woman madly dote / Upon the next live creature that it sees.” Oberon instructs Puck to place the juice from a flower onto the eyelids of the sleeping Tatiana, a concoction that will cause her to fall in love with the first living thing she perceives once she awakes. “This is the basis of the story… So much in the possibility of joy, laughter in mischief in this power. A great metaphor for life” – Angel Abreu, 2024.Invisible Man (after Ralph Ellison), 2024In this series, Studio K.O.S. drew from Ralph Ellison’s seminal 1952 text, Invisible Man, which explored themes such as the Great Migration, black nationalism, and Marxism. The works also draw from the iconography of the 1960s Civil Rights movement, evoking the aesthetics of the “I Am a Man!” placards carried throughout the 1968 Memphis Sanitation strikes.These collages originate from a series of workshops that took place during the pandemic over Zoom with MoMA New York, The Walker Art Center Minneapolis, Temple University Philadelphia, Windward School Los Angeles and The School of Visual Arts New York, with the pandemic necessitating new spaces for educating creation, interpretation, and collaboration. These pieces form part of a larger work of 1,369 parts that will be presented at The Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art upon completion.The Fire Next Time (after James Baldwin), 2022 & Where Do We Go From Here (after Martin Luther King), 2020The Fire Next Time (1963) is a collection of two essays by American author and activist James Baldwin which sought to garner publicity for the Civil Rights movement. Published four years later, Martin Luther King’s text, Where Do We Go from Here (1967), offered a way forward following the 1964 Civil Rights Act, calling for a nonviolent yet extensive social change that bypassed contemporary divides such as separatism and desegregation to call for a cross-party movement in the US. Abreu described, “We conducted a series of seances of sorts in which MLK and Baldwin were conjured to collaborate with us.” During workshops, excerpts from both books were read and participants were encouraged to use blades to scalpel the texts and create poetry by subtraction, addition, and omission. Here, cutting, pasting, and obliterating foster novel modes of interpretation.Studio K.O.S. is Angel Abreu (b. Bronx, NY, USA 1974) and Ricardo Savinon (b. New York, NY, USA 1971).

His highly symbolic figures personify existential concerns, uncovering collective knowledge and visualising a return to the primal fact of existence. Whilst centred on the universal, his practice equally threads through a personal exploration of his own identity, using the naked body to connect viewers to his sense of vulnerability as a queer person. Correa Mejía presents these nude bodies as exuberant, spiritually harmonious beings that suppress notions of a singular identity and find empowerment in a universal connection to nature. Adopting a limited palette of ultramarine and red oil paint that is applied on jute, he summons the divine power of contrasting yet complimentary forces.“Living beings feel danger when they detect a nearby predator. They become still, they become invisible, and they hide their radiantly beautiful essence to protect their life. Humans are no longer considered animal predators, yet many in our species have become cruel predators that are afraid of allowing diversity to flourish organically between us.Painting is a ritual that allows me to connect to the wholeness of life. When painting I find calm in solitude, but I also find companionship in other living beings; the animal and vegetable. The elemental beings act as allies, extensions, and reflections of myself. They become symbols that help me navigate the path of life embracing existential questions about identity, gender, sexuality, loss, and grief that emerge. The new moon brings renovation, and femininity, and guides life’s rhythms. Flowers act as healers which help make us return to unity. Seeds appear as symbols for fertility whilst the feather signifies transformation and the freedom to fly beyond our skin.I identify queerness in the dolphin, a wise being of the water that returns to the surface to breathe, an action tied to gender fluidity and border diffusion. The armadillo is a symbol of the inner child being protected within me, shielding themselves with their armour. Butterflies emerge from their chrysalis and accept change with their wings open. These beings are watched over by the generous tree that gives air, shelter, and food.” – Daniel Correa Mejía, 2024.Daniel Correa Mejía (b. 1986, Medellín, Colombia) lives and works in Berlin and is represented by mor charpentier, Paris.

Across her oeuvre, Andreani repurposes personal memorabilia and archival photographs, addressing forgotten histories through a subversive and feminist lens. Working primarily in her signature palette of Payne’s grey – a blue-grey hue rich with echos of the past – her works unearth buried narratives to reconstruct timeless and prescient stories for the present moment.Emerging from a compendium of collective memories, the exhibited works find their origins in the archives of Reggio Emilia. Faded letters, yellowed documents and, above all, black-and-white photographs comprise the foundation of the artist’s practice. Guided by an unorthodox approach to research, Andreani selects, gathers and filters archival material in a non-linear way, sifting, layering and interweaving freeze-framed moments in time. Driven by the sociopolitical history of Reggio Emilia, the resulting compositions raise poignant questions about the perceived societal roles of women throughout history, contending with underlying power dynamics while dismantling gender stereotypes.Lending the exhibition its title, Andreani’s painting L’improduttiva (The Unproductive One), 2023, presents a group of students entirely absorbed in their work as seamstresses. All but one, that is, who looks out towards the viewer defiantly, a mischievous smile flitting across her face. The work is based on an archival photograph from the early 1940s which documents the tailoring school of Reggio Emilia, founded at this time by Giulia Maramotti. While women’s acceptance into the workforce during World War II marked a breakthrough moment of emancipation, it simultaneously highlighted the vast gulf of opportunity and liberty between the sexes. Capturing the viewer's attention, the woman’s brazen smirk and gaze serve as a symbol of this inherent irony.A smiling woman has often been denigrated as mad or hysterical throughout history. Such themes of insanity, internal exile and imprisonment, tied so closely to women’s history, are integral to Andreani’s research. Drawing from the archival material of the former Psychiatric Hospital of San Lazzaro, dating from the late nineteenth century to the 1970s, the artist painted her seven canvas work, Le sette sante (The Seven Holy Ones), 2023. Based on small identity photographs of seven female internees, originally taken for documentation purposes, Andreani enlarges each image to the scale of a human face, as if restoring her subjects with dignity and compassion.Melding fact and fiction, Andreani’s works offer visual montages in which histories, temporalities and topographies collide. In the largest painting in the exhibition, La traghettatrice (The Ferryman), 2023, four seemingly disparate figures are represented along a picture-postcard seafront, as two warplanes dive ominously in the background. Based on photographs from different archives, each figure looks directly out at the viewer, drawing us in to their individual worlds.Giving voice to the voiceless of bygone eras, Andreani’s works frequently centre anonymous subjects, particularly female ones, elevating the traditionally sidelined to historical status. The motif of the mask is a recurring trope across her oeuvre. Prevalent in two of the exhibited works from 2023, L’anonima (The Anonymous One) and La gitana anarchica (Djali-Leda) (The Anarchist Gypsy (Djali-Leda)), it becomes representative of the performative roles enacted by women to survive in society. In masking her protagonists, Andreani in fact draws attention to them, endowing them with an unbreakable, formidable strength. Thus foregrounding the small but mighty ripples made by defiant women through history, Andreani weaves new life from the dust of forgotten archives.Giulia Andreani (*1985, Venice) lives and works in Paris. Andreani’s work has been the subject of solo exhibitions in international institutions including Collezione Maramotti, Reggio Emilia (2024); Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dole (2019–2020); Labanque, Béthune (2019); Villa Médicis, Rome (2018); Centre d’Art Nei Liicht de Dudelange, Luxembourg (2017); La Conserverie, Metz (2016); Lab Labanque Béthune, Richebourg (2014); Centre culturel l’Escale, Levallois (2013); and Premier Regard, Paris (2012), among others.Andreani’s work is in the public collections of Centre Pompidou, Paris; MASP, São Paulo; Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin; Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BnF), Paris; Collezione Maramotti, Reggio Emilia; Musée national de l’histoire de l’immigration, Paris; FRAC Poitou-Charentes, Angoulême; Centre Culturel Opderschmelz, Dudelange; Collection de la Ville de Montrouge; and URDLA, Villeurbanne.Giulia Andreani’s work is currently on view as part the 60th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia.",Giulia Andreani: L'improduttiva,"41 Dover Street, W1S 4NS","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 30 May  - 3 Aug 2024

Often using simple shapes to structure his works, the artist fuses personal influences with European tradition and American abstraction, grounding vast scale and gesture with visual delicacy and a sense of vulnerability.Comprising new paintings, drawings and aquatints, the exhibition presents works from important series including ‘Wall of Light’ which has its origins in a watercolour from the 1980s and ‘Landlines’, ongoing since the late 1990s. Also included are more recently initiated hybrids of these, such as the ‘Wall Landlines’ and ‘Nets and Cages’.The warm hued Wall Red Blue, 2023, alongside the cooler Wall Pinks Blue, 2023, are among the latest additions to Scully’s ‘Wall of Light’ series, in which the arranged blocks of colour almost, but not quite, touch. Reminiscent of delicate cracks in a wall, this allows for glimpses of the lighter pigment beneath the paint to seep through. Two works on aluminium from the ‘Landlines’ series, both painted this year, take up the artist’s fascination for the horizon lines separating sea, sky and land.

The work combines the horizontal bands from Scully’s earlier ‘Landlines’ works with an ‘inset’ – a painting within a painting – of the coloured blocks typical of the ‘Wall of Light’ series. Insets have appeared in many of Scully’s multi-part constructions in the past forty years: the artist uses them to evoke a double experience, almost like a mother-child association, as well as a haptic composition which sits somewhere between painting and sculpture.Three drawings, one from each of the main series represented in the exhibition, accompany the paintings, showing the genesis of these often very large-scale works on a more intimate scale. The selection of works is completed by five aquatints, all from 2023.

"Max Hetzler, Goethestr.",Berlin,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/tursic-mille-stains-stars-and-other-catastrophes/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Tursic & Mille,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/ida-tursic-wilfried-mille/,"Comprising paintings, works on paper and sculpture from across several series, the exhibition centres on the concept of ‘catastrophe’ as a creative principle. In mathematics, a catastrophe refers to the point at which a function, triggered by minor variations, abruptly changes form. Similarly, Tursic & Mille’s work – characterised by elements of collage, art historical associations, and a détournement of painting’s intentions – invites pictorial and semantic catastrophes to unfold. The catastrophe becomes the very essence of painting. After all, all painting begins with a stain on a support.Presented for the first time are 160 abstract works on paper from Tursic & Mille’s ongoing series of ‘Papers’, initiated in the early 2000s. Comprised of A3 sheets of paper on which the artists test colours and wipe their brushes, these works act as ‘evidence of the painting process itself […] reflecting our way of doing things, our way of thinking about painting, and giving pride of place to the process itself in the intimacy of the studio, like a logbook, a diary.’ (1) Brimming with spontaneous energy, the compositions eschew all intentions, posing the fundamental question of ‘what to do’ and reinforcing the empirical idea of simply ‘doing’.The sculptural piece Sisyphe (Time Mass), 2016–2023, explores this question in the third dimension. The work presents seven years of excess paint from the duo’s studio, accumulated on a single panel in the form of a growing mound. Here, the artists conjure a creative catastrophe of its own, namely the reality of painting as a Sisyphean task – a futile heap of material which embodies the artists’ endless attempt at understanding the world around them.Several new paintings on canvas recycle source material from the artists’ studio. Depicting a pair of enlarged hands, Detail, 2024, is based on a printed detail that was used for an earlier painting in 2014. In the present work, the scotch tape and yellow paint stains from the original print-out have been transcribed and immortalised in paint. Black and White Piece, another oil painting from 2024, results from a similar process; depicting a vast mountain range, the painting’s upper left corner renders a tear in the original source material. In the artists’ visual realm, all landscapes are the result of catastrophes at work, be they geological or pictorial. Similarly, Tursic & Mille’s images feed on themselves, generating new possibilities in the process of their creation. The effect, the artists explain, is that ‘everything becomes still life.’ The original nature of the subject shifts to a radically empirical one: the painted object as a subject in itself.Further illustrating the duo’s commitment to pictorial renewal, six paintings from the artists’ ongoing series of ‘Modifications’ summon the work of Jean-Honoré Fragonard (1732–1806), Antoine Vollon (1833–1900) and Jean-Bapstiste Greuze (1725–1805), drawing on their masterworks as literal and conceptual backdrops against which to set new interventions. The blank canvas, Tursic & Mille seem to point out, is a myth.In an age defined by its endless circulation of content and vast well of material, Tursic & Mille challenge linear modes of art making and embrace chance encounters as the very essence of painting. The result is an eternal renegotiation of disorder and order, accident and intent. It is indeed by embracing catastrophe that the artists renew their quest for ways to express the world through paint.Ida Tursic (*1974, Belgrade, Serbia) and Wilfried Mille (*1974, Boulogne-Sur-Mer, France) live and work in Mazamet, France. Tursic & Mille’s work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at numerous institutions, most recently including FRAC – Fonds regional d’art contemporain de Normandie, Caen (2023); Consortium Museum, Dijon (2022); Le Portique, Le Havre (2021); Muzeum Sztuki, Łodz (2020); Fondation d’Entreprise Ricard, Paris (2017); Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dole (2011); FRAC Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand (2011) and Le Musée de Serignan (2008–2009).

Recalling his own memories of the play, the impact and the culture of spectacle that continues to inform the incident today, Barney addresses the consequences of a sport that has become synonymous with physical brutality. Moving from pregame to game, from play to impact, and finally arriving at the media’s relentless repetition of the collision itself, the exhibitions examine the connective tissue that joins our scopophilic desire to witness lethal force with the anxieties stirred by the vulnerabilities of our own bodies.Consistent with Barney’s practice, the sculptural works in the exhibition trespass from the screen to the gallery, blurring the distance between the artist’s constructed cinematic narratives and the corporeal. Comprised of a range of materials that exhibit individual intrinsic behaviours, the objects in SECONDARY probe issues of time and aging. Conjuring the limits of the body by using mediums that respectively indicate elasticity (synthetic polymers), strength (cast metals), and fragility (ceramic), Barney both memorialises and pathologises the Tatum/Stingley event. Also included in each exhibition are a new series of large-scale drawings on aluminium panel, each of which expands upon the motif of the field emblem. Simultaneously diagrammatic and abstract, these drawings examine issues of repetition, memory, and the flux between the symbolic and the real.For his installation at Galerie Max Hetzler, SECONDARY: object impact, Barney presents a series of objects that address the concept of impact as both a physical interaction and a theoretical system of exchange. Central to the exhibition is impact BOLUS, a sculpture that strips back the prosthetic skin of the artist’s iconic 1991 work, DRILL TEAM: screw BOLUS, and exposes its unguarded interior. The piece is largely comprised of casts made from the negative space between Tatum and Stingley (performed in the film by Raphael Xavier and David Thomson) at the moment of contact. Memorialising the exact distance between the two colliding players, the sculpture suggests an interaction that ricochets between extreme violence and physical intimacy. With its series of vertebrae-like elements draped in a shroud of netted dumbbells, impact BOLUS edges incrementally towards figuration, its components exploring both the body and a culture that demands its sacrifice in exchange for entertainment. Also included in the installation is Patriot, a white polyethylene structure draped with Stingley’s jersey that hovers between effigy and ghost. Here, Barney’s historical investigations are both conjured and negated; in lieu of probing the relationship between resistance and material potential, the artist instead presents a pair of objects in a state of exhaustion.The video installation, SECONDARY, is on view concurrently in Paris at the Fondation Cartier from 8 June to 8 September 2024.",Matthew Barney: SECONDARY: object impact,"46 & 57, rue du Temple, 75004","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-7pm", 7 Jun  - 25 Jul 2024

Her interest in the figure of the goddess – particularly the Hindu goddess Kali, who both destroys and creates the world anew, and is often pictured with a garland of human heads – is evident in her depictions of women metamorphosing into nature. In Sikand’s paintings, women are seeds buried in soil, hang on tree branches to provide shelter, or are even the earth and sky themselves. These amorphous relationships between the figure and nature were further inspired by the Chipko environmental movement, which began in north India during the 1970s, when villagers – mostly women – embraced trees at risk of deforestation, a protest that also highlighted their primary role as caregivers. Sikand’s female figures are often portrayed as strong: appearing resolute with multiple heads or acting as protectors over her landscapes. They also remain ambiguous and elusive, echoing the shapeshifting symbolism of Hindu allegories that persisted in her imagination.Sikand’s paintings contain multiple layers of gouache, watercolour and ink, often laboriously made. Her deep fascination with palimpsests – ancient parchments scraped clean and used again, that bear the traces of time – led her to experiment with breaking the surface of her paintings, likely using sandpaper and wire wool as she did in later works, and then repairing the paper in a technique similar to papier mâché. Sikand’s works function as pentimenti, where the marks of earlier paintings lie visible underneath the surface. In her acts of erasure and revision, she folded history into her work, gesturing to the unreliability of memory and the tension in the encounter between images from different cultures.Born in 1960 in the Punjab region of India, Sikand relocated with her family in 1970 aged 10 and eventually settled in the Rhondda valley in South Wales. She attended City of Birmingham Polytechnic and upon graduating in 1983 moved to Nottingham, where she lived, worked, and was deeply active in the arts community for close to 40 years. After being selected by Gavin Jantjes as the East Midlands Arts Prize winner in 1984, she co-founded the Nottingham Indian Artists’ Group alongside Said Adrus and Sardul Gill. In 1987, she had her first solo exhibition in London at the pioneering feminist bookshop Sisterwrite. In 1988, she was included in Eddie Chambers’ foundational touring group exhibition Black Art: Plotting the Course, and her painting featured on the cover of that catalogue. Sikand’s work was included in other significant exhibitions in the 1980s and 1990s including The Circular Dance at Arnolfini, Bristol, alongside Sutapa Biswas and Chila Kumari Burman (1991); Myth, Dream, and Fable at Angel Row Gallery, Nottingham, alongside Paula Rego and Eileen Cooper (1992); and Transforming the Crown: African, Asian and Caribbean Artists in Britain 1966–1996 at the Caribbean Cultural Center, New York, alongside Lubaina Himid, Claudette Johnson, and Keith Piper, amongst many others (1997). She exhibited less after 2000, although her commitment to her practice remained absolute. Recent solo exhibitions of her work have taken place at New Art Exchange, Nottingham (2012); TG Gallery, Nottingham (2021); and Trace Gallery, Nottingham (2023). Since Sikand’s death in 2021, her work has been acquired by collections including the British Museum, London; Nottingham City Museums via the Contemporary Art Society; and the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Norwich.",Gurminder Sikand: Early Paintings,"47 Mortimer Street, W1W 8HJ","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 16 May  - 29 Jun 2024

This exhibition is being held at a time when Cordeiro’s significance is increasingly being recognised on the international stage. He is, for example, among the invited artists in this year’s Venice Biennale, opening shortly before The Mayor Gallery’s exhibition. Cordeiro’s works are also held in major museum and private collections internationally, including the Cisneros Collection (CPPC), Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, MoMA, New York, Reina Sofia, Madrid, Museum of Contemporary Art, São Paulo and the Victoria & Albert Museum, London.Born in 1925 in Rome to a Brazilian father and Italian mother, Cordeiro moved after World War II ended to São Paulo and assumed full Brazilian citizenship in 1948. His emergence as an influential artist in the early-mid 1950s in São Paulo coincided with a postwar moment when Brazil — described then by media theorist Vilém Flusser as a country ""in the making"" — first became known internationally for radical architectural and urban landscaping interventions, led by Oscar Niemeyer and Roberto Burle Marx. In 1952, Cordeiro — with six like- minded collaborators including Gerald de Barros — formed a group and movement they named 'Ruptura', signaling a substantive break with the figuration otherwise dominant in visual art until that period. Combining this with often polemical articles and reviews of the works of others, Cordeiro was regarded throughout the 1950s in Brazil as a critical figurehead of a technological aesthetics that began to be associated in particular with São Paulo based artists and writers.As this exhibition brings into exceptional focus through its display of remarkable concrete art works such as Círculos Simultâneos of 1952 and Transposição Cromática Estudo da Cor from 1958, Cordeiro is a master at combining a sensory-affective field of interplay between lines and circles, colours and planes with a sense of technological distancing. The 1950s material as well as a series of works from the early-mid 1960s (never before seen in Europe) included in this exhibition are revealed as critical steps towards the pioneering leap taken by Cordeiro from the late 1960s into the early 1970s with his use of electronic computation to create indelibly memorable and highly original works of art. Four of Cordeiro’s computer-based art prints — including the extraordinary The Woman Who Is Not B.B. (A mulher que não e B.B.), 1971, that radically differentiated Cordeiro’s work from others in the same period with its use of computers to convey a highly critical socio- political message —are among the important highlights of this exhibition.Indeed, over the course of Cordeiro’s artistic practice from its beginnings to its radically early closure, we find an inextricable entangling of aesthetic and social concerns. This is addressed in a specially commissioned catalogue essay for this exhibition from art and media historian, Bronac Ferran.The selection of works for this new exhibition at the recently opened new space of the Mayor Gallery in St James’s has been made in close collaboration with Waldemar Cordeiro’s daughter, Analivia Cordeiro, who is also an internationally renowned artist.

He then developed his current artistic practice, while also working as an illustrator for several years. His architectural background is evident within his work, with Brazilian modernist architecture and his home of São Paulo influencing both form and colour within his oeuvre. His muted, monochromatic palette emerged from São Paulo’s concrete landscape, with the organised geometry of modernist architecture translated into the precise aesthetic of his compositions, much like his experience with black and white photography.In his debut exhibition at Mazzoleni, Espírito Santo presents four sculptures which utilise distinct materials: stone, glass and metal. Each sculpture presents an accurate representation of a real object’s shapes and proportions, while simultaneously playing with the scale and materiality. For three decades this has been a constant strategy for the artist, exploring ordinary objects that are usually neglected due to their banality. With the restriction of the materials, Espírito Santo converges the tangibility of matter and the conceptual nature of artificial objects, using geometrical definitions that are implicit in them. The material’s density and weight conflict with the image quality of the sculptures, as exemplified in Luz Negra (2022), where the hyperreal finishing, not found in a functional light bulb, is elevated from the ordinary to the realm of auratic icon.My process of making sculptures involves a return to the design project, that is, a re-idealization of certain objects, which are mostly anonymous. It’s an essentially different operation from using a found object, a readymade, or making a cast of an object. My sculpture is not indexical. Instead of reproducing an actual object, it alludes to its technical drawing, to the conception of its shape and dimensions. - Iran do Espírito Santo, 2021In a separate space, a selection of watercolours on paper are exhibited, which go further to explore the intricacies involved in Espírito Santo’s work. These works are also created from meticulous observations of real objects. Luz Negra IX (2021) moves to reawaken us from our habitual indifference towards the everyday, instead communicating the beauty that can be found in the mechanics of human existence. The artist’s watercolours, a traditionally fluid medium, are controlled and contained and just like the sculptures, are composed of basic geometrical forms that are gathered to create a recognisable sign. Espírito Santo explains that “In many of my works, abstraction and concreteness are brought together as two poles that parallel the human existential condition, which is compulsorily subject to concrete reality and abstract thinking.”",Iran do Espírito Santo,"15 Old Bond Street, W1S 4AX","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat by appointment", 30 May  - 6 Sep 2024

As Benjamin Buchloh aptly remarks, he pursued his studies as cultural studies, a method of artistic intervention—long before this trend in art became widely established.A New York Times critic once observed in consternation that Dan Graham, an Aries, made no distinction between Ludwig Wittgenstein and Britney Spears—even referencing their zodiac signs. And Sebastian Egenhofer states: “Graham's humor is an assent to the instability of the subject, whose masks are set up around an empty center, a lack, a hole (…).”The exhibition will be accompanied by a publication of significant texts by and about Dan Graham, focussing on his truly unlimited activities and influence in the field of art and culture, with texts by Ute Meta Bauer, Dieter Bogner, Sabine Breitwieser, Helmut Draxler, Sebastian Egenhofer, Zdenek Felix, Andrea Fraser, Kim Gordon, Dan Graham, Franziska Hausmaninger, Robin Hurst, Kasper König, Mieko Meguro, Christian Meyer and Jeff Wall.",Dan Graham – Optics and Humor,"Eschenbachgasse 9, A-1010","Tue-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 11am-3pm", 12 Apr  - 6 Jul 2024

Seemingly delicate, the weightless rice paper surfaces are reminiscent of the long, narrative registers of the 16th century Bayeux Tapestry or the subtlety of Giorgio Morandi’s still lives. The works transcend their contemporary trappings and genre associations to create something wholly originalLiminal Spaces offers a continuation of Krishnan’s work in the spirit of the Perennial Upanishadic dictum, vasudhaiva kutumbakam: “the world is one family.” In this exhibition, the artist builds her own sense of familial identity as a mother; the act of creation (both on the canvas and in her body) allowing her to “gain a fresh perspective and experience new life.” Each of her subjects, though rooted in the artist’s familiar past, are concentrated in the present and prompt the viewer to listen attentively to their stories.To achieve her signature textural quality, Krishnan layers together fibrous, brittle rice paper. Watercolors are then built up in thin washes of delicate blue and earth tones to achieve a supple, singular patina resembling an old map or sepia-toned photograph. The absence of the illusion of depth means Krishnan’s brushstrokes and subjects stand out sharply; the topography of the natural world blending with the architecture of village life. Her works on linen carry a similarly effortless quality.The entanglement between humanity and ecology manifests across this body of work on both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. In Womb, the title refers both to the figure of the pregnant woman and her reflection in the rippling pool of water she stands in. Saying bye features accumulation and repetition; the silent gesture of a waving hand of a mother echoes the communication of her baby in utero. With Krishnan’s brush, a cluster of trees becomes a portrait as much as a disparate group of individuals transforms into a landscape. “I started seeing the landscape as a metaphor for this internal transformation,” says Krishnan. “As a result, a realm beyond verbal expression started unfolding. The whole process was something organic, which led to a fragile ecosystem on the canvas.” In their fragility, Krishnan’s landscapes stand as their own and establish a nuanced perspective in contemporary portraiture.",Siji Krishnan: Liminal Spaces,"1227 North Highland Ave, CA 90038","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 26 Apr  - 8 Jun 2024  
Michael Rosenfeld Gallery,New York Chelsea,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/richmond-barthe-a-new-day-is-coming/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Richmond Barthé,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/richmond-barthe/,"A quintessential artist of the Harlem Renaissance, Barthé created a pioneering body of sculpture that elevates the Black subject. Much of Barthé’s oeuvre reflects his penchant for allegory and an embrace of classical realism that rendered him a stylistic outlier of his generation. He consistently sought to convey a universal sense of heroism reflective of the African diaspora through his sculpture, producing a refined body of bust-length portraits and full-length figures portraying a variety of individuals, including historical luminaries, archetypal, religious, and mythological subjects, and contemporary celebrities from the dance and theater worlds. While the Black male figure was a prevailing focus of Barthé’s practice, a consideration of his larger oeuvre reveals a career-long investment in depicting subjects of both genders with authority and empathy. Often working from memory, Barthé used his superior technical ability to imbue his sculptures with a sense of movement and emotional interiority, affectingly capturing the spiritual essence of his subjects. A New Day Is Coming features several of the artist’s most celebrated sculptures, such as Feral Benga (1935), which portrays Parisian cabaret dancer François “Feral” Benga; Julius (c.1940), a portrait of Julius Perkins, Jr., a child actor and musician active in Harlem; Stevedore (1937) a heroic representation of the working everyman; Black Madonna (1961), an iconographic interpretation of the Holy Mother as a Black woman; and The Negro Looks Ahead (1944), a symbolic rendition of Black fortitude.Though Barthé was never open about his sexuality, his frequent portrayals of the male nude were recognized as expressions of homoerotic desire by his friends and peers in the art and literary world. During his years in New York (1929–1948), Barthé became a key figure in an elite milieu of creatives and intellectuals who discretely incorporated gay themes into their work, including poets Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, and Countee Cullen, cabaret performer Jimmie Daniels, play-wright Harold Jackman, and photographer Carl Van Vechten. Barthé formed particularly important friendships with the poet Richard Bruce Nugent and Harlem Renaissance philosopher Alain Locke, the latter of whom considered Barthé’s sculpture a consummate embodiment of the New Negro Movement’s mandate to uplift the collective consciousness of Black America.Both Locke and Nugent are important figures in Isaac Julien’s filmography. His breakthrough film Looking for Langston (1989) is a lyrical montage of real and imagined sequences exploring the lives and work of Harlem’s gay cultural luminaries of the 1920s and their descendants in the 1980s; the film features excerpts from Nugent’s short story “Smoke, Lilies, and Jade” (1926) as well as archival footage of Locke and Barthé. Once Again . . . (Statues Never Die) is, in many ways, a sequel to Looking for Langston, taking up many of the same themes and subjects. Structured around a conversation between Locke and Albert C. Barnes, an important collector of African sculpture and founder of the Barnes Foundation, the film poetically weaves a thematic exploration of Black queer desire into its timely meditation on the collection and display of African material culture in European and American institutions. Locke and Barthé’s relationship is a primary touchpoint in the film’s arc, and Barthé’s sculptures figure prominently in the film.A New Day Is Coming features several casts from editions Barthé produced in the 1940s through the 1960s, as well as standout examples of his unique painted plaster sculptures dating from 1935 through 1966. The exhibition also includes several editions cast in the final decade of Barthé’s life drawn from the collection of art historian, curator, artist, and Barthé scholar Samella Lewis (1923–2022), who was close friends with the sculptor. In 1985–86, Dr. Lewis assisted Barthé in casting new editions of many of his most accomplished sculptures—a project funded by another important friend and patron, the actor James Garner. Reproductions of archival photographs commemorating highlights of Barthé’s life and career are installed throughout the gallery, providing a historical backdrop to the presentation. These photos complement two large-scale Inkjet prints by Julien capturing a moment in Once Again... Statues Never Die in which the film’s characters contemplate Barthé’s Black Madonna (1961).Richmond Barthé: A New Day Is Coming is mounted in conversation with multiple recent and ongoing museum exhibitions. In 2022, the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia opened Isaac Julien: Once Again . . . (Statues Never Die), an immersive, five-screen installation by Julien commissioned by the Foundation on the occasion of their centennial. Installed among the screens were three of the Barthé sculptures featured in the film, eight works of African art from the Foundation’s collection, and a selection of works by contemporary sculptor Matthew Angelo Harrison. In 2023, the Tate Britain opened the traveling career retrospective Isaac Julien: What Freedom is to me, which featured seven of the artist’s major film installations, including Once Again . . . (Statues Never Die); the exhibition is currently on view at its final venue, the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht, The Netherlands, through August 17, 2024.Once Again . . . (Statues Never Die) is also featured in the 2024 Whitney Biennial, Even Better Than the Real Thing, open through August 11, 2024. Among the Barthé sculptures augmenting this iteration of the work is a cast of Barthé’s Stevedore (1937) on loan from Michael Rosenfeld Gallery. The installation also features two Barthé sculptures owned by the Whitney, African Dancer (1933)—which was included in the museum’s First Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary American Sculpture, Watercolors, and Prints in 1933—and The Blackberry Woman (1932). Notably, when the museum acquired The Blackberry Woman in 1932, Barthé became the first Black artist to enter their collection. Finally, two of Barthé’s most renowned sculptures, The Boxer (1942) and Feral Benga (1935–36), are currently on view in The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s much-anticipated historical survey The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism, open through July 28, 2024.Richmond Barthé: A New Day Is Coming is Michael Rosenfeld Gallery’s first solo exhibition on the artist, who has been an important presence in the gallery’s program for nearly thirty-five years.",Richmond Barthé: A New Day Is Coming,"100 11th Avenue, NY 10011",Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, 6 Apr  - 26 Jul 2024

The hard, flat surface of masonite allowed him to play with space. Kirkeby states, “You put a line on a piece of paper or you take a brush or your thumb dipped in some ochre and rub it up on a cave wall and then you have a space. We’re in a space and we make a space. And by making it flat you can handle it.” Kirkeby considered the paintings on masonite to be more personal, and even more dynamic, than his paintings on canvas. Due to the long, storied history of paintings on canvas, Kirkeby felt the compositions needed to be more “crystallized”. In comparison, his paintings on masonite incorporated unconventional materials, such as collage and chalk, allowing Kirkeby to experiment with structure, form, and motif.Kirkeby started creating bronze sculptures in the early 1980s to pull himself out of a brief “artistic crisis”. His career was growing internationally, and Danish critiques of his art accused him of being too commercial. Like the paintings on masonite, the bronzes allowed him to play with space, but in a more tactile way. Kirkeby writes, “It is almost impossible to fixate a sculpture. It is best seen in passing, from the side. Individual details are difficult to get a hold of: they turn away from you. And even the nature of the material is so concrete, so much of this world, that it spurns dreams.” Kirkeby’s bronze sculptures became an important part of his oeuvre. They allowed him to incorporate figuration and the work of his sculptural heroes, like Michealangelo and Auguste Rodin. The sculptures defined him as an accomplished “painter-sculptor” in line with his German contemporaries, Markus Lüpertz and A.R. Penck.An internationally celebrated painter, sculptor, filmmaker, and author, works by Kirkeby are found in many museum collections worldwide including Tate, London; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; and Museum of Modern Art, New York, among many others. Important solo museum exhibitions include Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebæk; Museum Jorn, Silkeborg; the Beaux-Arts de Paris; The Phillips Collection, Washington, DC; BOZAR Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels; Tate Modern, London; IVAM Centre del Carme, Valencia; Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Whitechapel Gallery, London; and Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven.

Even when painting a seemingly neutral subject, such as an abstract shape or an inanimate object, Simon is looking for the tension or “the hidden power beneath the surface.”In her recent works, Simon has shifted to painting figures and heads that are subjected to a variety of situations and scenarios. The heads, with their fixed expressions and hollow appearance, are also masks. As a mask, they conceal shame, block madness, and protect the wearer from anger and horror. While they can appear outwardly melancholic, aggressive, or apathetic, they are intended to convey deep emotion. For Simon, they act as a vehicle to give voice to inexpressible needs and suffering.Phantom, the painting for which the exhibition is named, most clearly illustrates Simon’s intention of making the unseen visible. The face of a spirit appears on the body of the painter and dominates her. Dots flow from the eyes, across the shoulders, and down the arms of the painter, as the painter then tries to capture the spirit on the canvas.Raphaela Simon studied at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf and the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. Solo exhibitions have been held worldwide at Fondazione Giuliani, Rome; Kunsthalle Düsseldorf; Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin and Paris; Hannah Hoffman Gallery, Los Angeles; and Michael Werner Gallery, London.

Mitterrand,Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/my-lan-hoang-thuy-notes/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",My-Lan Hoang-Thuy,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/my-lan-hoang-thuy/,"My-Lan Hoang-Thuy opens her second solo show at Galerie Mitterrand from May 23rd to July 27th, 2024. Aged 34, the artist has transformed the gallery space, rendering it feverish: a large number of paintings and drawings cover almost the entirety of the gallery’s walls, in an exhilarating, oozing yet chiseled juxtaposition. Here, a large-format digital print on acrylic is laid bare on the wall. There, a series of head drawings on loose sketchbook pages run rigorously along an imagined ridgeline. Further ahead, is a framed collage, breaking with the compulsive hanging dynamics of the rest of the exhibition.The vast majority of the works date from 2023, a year marked by My-Lan Hoang-Thuy’s residency in Montmartre and two major exhibitions, where we discovered the artist ""and the boys"" as well as her hybrid use of photography (i). And it is undoubtedly in response or reaction to these three events that the genesis of such a proposal, boldly welcomed by the gallery, is worth seeing.My-Lan Hoang-Thuy and the boys. Or rather: My-Lan and the Boys Band. This uninhibited title marks the young artist's entry into the pantheon of the greatest names in modern and contemporary art. In this exhibition at Christies from September 8 to 21, 2023, My-Lan's works were presented in subtle dialogue with those of her ""fathers/peers"": Lee Ufan, Victor Hugo, Pierre Bonnard, Kai Althoff and the studio of Wiliam Morris. In a secluded, inconspicuous room, the artist had arranged reproductions of her teenage drawings, the tenor of which can only be touching. Shy, cheerful drawings of the Spice Girls, framed for the occasion, bore the status of confession. In this very spot, in September 2023, My-Lan was already revealing another part of herself. She was telling her story through her fantasized entourage (the Boys Band) and through an adolescent gesture characterized by a rereading of the emotions and myths specific to that tender, ungrateful age.Her new exhibition at the Galerie Mitterrand is a delightful extension of this. The Spice Girls, once plunged into the darkness of a padded room, have now emerged from their sheet of paper. They are reunited under every facet of My-Lan Hoang-Thuy's work, who takes advantage of her own impertinence to present a display of immense vi-ta-li-ty. Let's face it, age is a matter of mood, and the gallery resembles the walls of a teenager's bedroom. But here, My-Lan doesn't play the young girl. On the contrary, she exhibits her great erudition, which lingers on the art of mural composition, reviving the feverish spirit of fan-art hangings and 19th-century reproduction collectorsii. Better still, the erudition turns to the artist, who no longer encumbers herself with tutelary figures. She is the star. Framed tightly around her upturned face, she proudly gazes out at us in one of her inkjet- on-acrylic self-portraits. In this work, My-Lan leaves aside the representation of her own body to focus on her face and the corporeality of her painting, which makes a case for the image ""tattooing"" the material. The artist fully inhabits her painting, just as she inhabits and modulates her light, starting with that of her Montmartre studio, which it flooded in 2023.Two ""studio"" paintings are displayed above My-Lan’s en gloire portrait - Autoportrait (1). Respectively Montmartre 6 and Montmatre 3, represent pieces of glimmer, emanating from a door or a window, that the artist photographed from her former “green encircled” studio. Did her time at Art Explora's studio bring her painting of photography (the medium of light) more in line with that of painting, to the point where the latter absorbed the image? It would seem so. The new paintings are bursting with light emanating from the pictorial material: northern light, metallic light, ectoplasmic light, and iridescent light. Unlike Montmartre 6 and Montmatre 3, Steppu and Trousseau Crème transfigure the luminous vibration that is no longer a matter of representation. In this, they share an unintentional affinity with the shimmering canvases of Anna Eva Bergman, particularly her rock walls, executed on her return from a trip to the Norwegian wilderness in the late 60s.While this reference is not intended by the young artist, it does provide an important notion of painting as a vibratory space and a medium for the unspeakable. Indeed, this is a particularity shared by Lee Ufan with regard to his own work: to experience painting is also to feel its space- filling vibration and recognize its resonance.Solo Rose, the smallest work in the exhibition, acts as a guardian of this vibration: traces of oil pastel sprinkle a patch of watercolor on adhesive paper. The surface shimmers and opens beyond the visible, beyond the speakable, and even beyond the transitory. My-Lan Hoang-Thuy, like Lee Ufan, would place herself on the side of those things destined to be erased.My-Lan recovers and transforms what fades into oblivion. But can you recycle a memory the way you regenerate a sock? Gratin Gratiné (2022) bears this strange promise. A piece of fabric from one of her companion's old socks is used as a support for a digital print in which we think we recognize the strange silhouette of a woman. The fabric is no mere coincidence or material anecdote. It is the very proof that My Lan is striving to awaken the neglected by giving it an ornament. Other works in the exhibition attest to her wise art of reuse: Qui Aime L'Hiver (2019) and 24 candidats (2022). The caption for the former mentions the use of cardboard packaging and toilet paper rolls. The second doesn't say much about the everyday materials used (India ink, watercolor and acrylic paint on paper). Yet it is the result of the same technique of collecting and putting on hold. The three components (the drawing, the faded background, and the piece of red) were made at different times in the artist's life, then individually preserved in boxes. After a few months' maturing, the artist uses them, juxtaposing these different visual parcels in a gesture akin to a ""self-fiction surge"". This term defines not only the conditions of the work's genesis, but also My-Lan's ability to tell her own story through heterogeneous materials. Applied to the scale of the exhibition, this term would even define the whole of her curatorial gesture: a combination of scattered materials in an autobiographical perspective in which My-Lan takes control of her narrative.During our discussions, My-Lan told me about her problem with a model painting that lacked ""guts"". This comment related to one of her works (Pull Marvin, 2023), which originally depicted a portrait of her partner, of which all that remains is a piece of sweater in the top right-hand corner. This comment goes beyond the description of a single work, as it applies to all her new work, in which she ceases to ""play the model"". The artist is indeed known for her stripped-down photographic self- portraits: poses of herself for herself, which she develops alongside her recurring practice as a model. But the practice of nudity is becoming increasingly rare (her exhibition at the Maison Européenne de la Photographie already marked this first step aside). According to the artist, drawing has taken its place as a means of exposing the nakedness.At the heart of this exhibition, drawing is triumphant, in a nudity that dares not speak its name.These heads, drawn by the dozens, cohabit with a painting that seems to have resolutely taken the step of using material as theme: it is it who draws the motif, raising levels of depth and light. For this reason, My-Lan acts like her painting. They take parallel paths: they draw a line across the space of representation to fully inhabit the body of the painting that dictates itself. What we see here then, cascading down these walls, is called a novel.- Julia Marchand(i) Les expositions Boys Band chez Christies (8 - 21 septembre 2023) et Femme Actuelle à la Maison Européenne de la Photographie (18 octobre – 10 decembre 2023)(ii) Pierre-Lin Renié, 2006, “The Image on the Wall: Prints as Decoration in Nineteeth-Century Interiors”, in Nineteeth-Century Art Worldwide (available online).",My-Lan Hoang-Thuy: Notes,"79, rue du Temple, 75003",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 23 May  - 27 Jul 2024  
Mitterrand,Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/raphael-zarka-tautochrone/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Raphaël Zarka,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/raphael-zarka/,"The fastest curve in the world. Behind the conciseness of this statement, worthy of a fairground attraction, lie several centuries of research and challenges between scientists to define the calculation of a cycloid. Nicknamed ""the Helen of Geometers"", it's hardly surprising that its history and properties have captured Raphaël Zarka's attention and curiosity, as his interests converge on movement and its applications, or more precisely on the objects, architectures, and devices capable of generating and measuring it.While it may be necessary to refer here to the artist's ""historicized approach to abstraction"", which consists in identifying the recurrences and shifts over time and geography of geometric forms between different fields of knowledge, and translating them into the field of art, it should be remembered that his work is just as (in-)formed by the practice of skateboarding and its spaces, to which he has devoted several essays. It is no surprise, then, that he has traced this cycloidal curve from an article in a skateboarding magazine from 1985 to the physics cabinets of the 17th and 18th centuries, to the discovery of instruments (or replicas thereof) designed to observe its properties at Padua University's Museum of the History of Physics, then at Florence's Museo Galileo.In the tradition of his ""documentary sculptures"", whose vocabulary refers to geometric abstraction by taking up ""loaded"" forms from the history of art, science, and technology, the Tautochrone (2007) which gives its title to the exhibition is a replica of a double-channel semicircular apparatus attributed to Galileo for studying the isochronism of pendulums. But as the artist explains, ""it took many years before the problem of the isochronism of pendulums and its corollary, that of the tautochronous curve, was solved"" (1) which, contrary to Galileo's belief, is not an arc of a circle, but a cycloid, as the artist materializes in the sculpture Tautochrone vérifié (2010).From a mechanical instrument designed to study the movement of bodies in space to a skateboard ramp, from sculpture to architecture and vice versa, the artist's recent projects place this research on the scale of the human body and urban space. While Cycloïde Square (2024) takes the form of a sculpture-model complexifying the expected forms of a skatepark, evoking both an abstract sculpture by Sophie Taeuber and the astronomical observatory in Jaipur, India, the Cycloïde Piazza (2024) will be on view all summer, a few blocks from the gallery on the forecourt of the Centre Pompidou. An ""instrumental"" sculpture in public space, it becomes a practicable space for gliding, an agora, an amphitheater, a place that encourages movement as well as rest, a piazza within a piazza. Here, the traditional arched ramps of skateparks are transformed into cycloids, with stairs, platforms, tiers, and slopes, inviting us to test the Galilean laws of gravity with this geometric vocabulary.This back-and-forth between works designed for the exhibition space and for the public space, between site and non-site, value of use and of exhibition, is evident in La Doublure (2024) designed as part of the Nouveaux Commanditaires program in Trélazé, Maine-et-Loire. In architectural resonance with a former match manufacture, it combines, with two concrete slabs, the remains of one of the manufacture’s chimneys with a new chimney, a 24-metre-high sculpture whose base provides a room opened by four vents, and the surprise of a spiral brickwork assembly that opens onto the sky. Also a practicable sculpture whose function has yet to be invented, its double structure evokes that of the Second Cénotaphe d’Archimède (2012), a photo-based reconstruction of 16th-century English brick chimneys named in homage to the creator of the “endless screw”. By taking the spiral brick cladding on the chimneys of an English castle and reproducing it inside the lining of an industrial chimney in the French countryside, a dizzying game of echoes and references, translations and re-employments is played out.This mise en abime of historical and geographical strata finally unfolds in a new series of paintings presented in the exhibition. Entitled Bois Gnomonique (2024), it continues the artist's research on gnomons (2) and their functionalist ornamentation. Composed by overlapping and permuting ""instrumental motifs"" (triangles, circles, semicircles, etc.) taken from the bases of 17th- and 18th- century Scottish sundials, in the continuity of Abstractions gnomoniques (2019-2020), these engravings on wood bear witness to the combinatory systems at the heart of the artist's sculptural practice, applied this time to pictorial matter. Following a set protocol that nonetheless allows for chance through the overprinting of colors, they offer new variations on these motifs, like so many palimpsests. A tautochronous experience in which these witnesses to movement appear on every page in the present tense ""in equal times"".— Yoann Gourmel(1) Raphaël Zarka, Free Ride. Skateboard, mécanique galiléenne et formes simples, Éditions B42, Paris, 2021, p.90(2) “Sundial is one way of putting it, gnomon is another, and these two names for the same object say two different things. The sundial is the archaic ancestor of the clock, an instrument lacking in precision that can be swept away by the first hourglass that comes along; the gnomon, on the other hand, means ""he who knows"" and reminds us that by marking the movement of shadows, the gnomon was above all an instrument of knowledge.” Nina Léger, Zarka Fiction, Suite Galiléenne, La Villa Beatrix Enea, Anglet, 2019.",Raphaël Zarka: Tautochrone,"79, rue du Temple, 75003",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 23 May  - 27 Jul 2024

The idea is to spend some time there, leaving the sober space of the museum behind. When entering this café you walk into a mirrored interior with metallic reliefs on the walls, and with a bar counter, a small kitchen, and a toilet—whose water pipes connect Cafe Hansi directly with the gray basalt museum building.Above the entrance and on the outer walls, Schabus presents a special collection of objects that he has been acquiring for more than fifteen years. These include toy figures and music records, a pendulum clock, a canary, cups and beakers, and Hansa medicinal plaster. They all have one thing in common—they are all somehow named Hans, and are thus are like encoded signatures by the artist himself. With plenty of self-irony, Schabus plays games with one of the most common and ordinary first names of his generation.The contrast between the surrounding space of the museum and Cafe Hansi is also mirrored in the contrast between the exterior and the interior of the café itself. The outer skin is an ironical and simple wooden cladding, which contrasts starkly with the perfectly styled, minimalist, and literally crystal-clear interior. It is like entering a completely different world, whose beauty and precision are all the more noticeable due to the difference between inside and outside.The interior is a working bar, but it is not a bar like any other. It is seen specifically in terms of its status as a work of art inside a museum. The mirrors do not only make the space seem larger, they also make it possible for visitors to see the acts of seeing themselves and other users as part of an art event that is also still linked with everyday life. The way the waiter communicates is also subject to subtle instructions from the artist, while the geometrically reduced shapes of the cups is also a sign of an artistic impulse in the use of materials and forms that very consciously and very precisely deviates from conventional forms. All of this takes place without any force or exaggeration—as a scarcely perceptible balance between normalcy and show.",Hans Schabus: Cafe Hansi,"Museumsplatz 1, 1070",Tue-Sun 10am-6pm, permanent installation

While there is no record of direct correspondence between them, the Paris-based artists rubbed shoulders often enough to interpret reciprocity in their practices. They exhibited regularly with Pierre Matisse Gallery, where Dubuffet’s first solo exhibition occurred in 1947 and Giacometti’s in 1948. With singular bodies of work articulating the alienation and estrangement of a generation, the artists became icons of a postwar European vision at home and across the Atlantic.In New York, they both found acclaim and were among the roster of artists in the Museum of Modern Art’s New Images of Man (1959) curated by Peter Selz, who also organized solo exhibitions for each of them (Dubuffet in February 1962 and Giacometti in June 1965) at the museum. In the late 1950s, prior to Dubuffet’s commission to create his landmark Group of Four Trees (1969–72) for Chase Manhattan Plaza, Giacometti was initially chosen for the space. Unfamiliar with the city and unconvinced about how his figures would compete with the surrounding skyscrapers, he withdrew from the project. However, when he traveled to New York for his MoMA retrospective, shortly before his untimely death at the beginning of the following year, Giacometti made a special visit to the plaza and asked his wife Annette to stand where his sculptures would have been.Dubuffet x Giacometti is made possible by generous loans from American and European institutions, including Fondation Beyeler, Riehen; Fondation Maeght, Saint-Paul-de-Vence; and Pierre and Tana Matisse Foundation, New York, as well as from worldwide private collections. The exhibition will be accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue featuring new research by Nairne, as well as essays by Giacometti expert Casimiro Di Crescenzo and Dubuffet scholar Camille Houzé.",Dubuffet x Giacometti,"980 Madison Avenue, Third Floor, NY 10075",Mon-Sat 10am-6pm, 1 May  - 8 Jun 2024

Through his timeless still lifes, Morandi transforms mundane objects into symbols of deeper human experience, prompting reflection on the nature of existence itself. In contrast, Ralaivao’s paintings burst with energy and sensuality, capturing fleeting moments of intimacy and anticipation. His bold use of colour and dynamic compositions draw viewers into a world where every brushstroke pulses with life, inviting them to explore the boundaries between reality and imagination.Although the artists may seem like an unlikely pairing at first glance, their works share a profound reverence for the subtleties of everyday objects and a commitment to exploring the essence of perception itself. Both artists engage viewers by highlighting the compositional aspect of their artwork alongside material surfaces. While Morandi’s compositions resemble studio photography, evoking a sense of familial assembly akin to a wedding portrait, Ralaivao’s works reflect the influence of contemporary mobile phone photography, where the camera becomes an active participant in capturing moments and sparking immediate reflection and dialogue.Together, Morandi and Ralaivao weave a narrative that transcends the constraints of a single frame, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the timeless beauty of still life compositions. Born nearly a century apart, this exhibition reveals the shared differences between two artists, across generations, finding themselves in the same city, and united by a common bond: their unwavering dedication to the art of painting.“Both Ralaivao and Morandi are reductive artists, their language is quiet, the tone of their paintings cool, and it feels quite fitting that this exhibition should be a closely selected one. It offers a tantalising starter, and leaves me wanting more.” – Paul ColdwellAbout the Artists:Giorgio Morandi (1890-1964), born in Bologna, Italy, was an Italian painter renowned for his contemplative still lifes and landscapes. His works are held in numerous museums throughout the world, and celebrated for their timeless beauty and profound exploration of form and composition.Alexis Ralaivao (born 1991) is a French-Madagascan artist, living and working in Berlin. He has gained international acclaim for capturing fleeting moments of intimacy through tightly cropped compositions.

This characteristic can be seen in the work of historical artists, who are considered references or inspiration for the artist, such as Pablo Picasso and Tarsila do Amaral. In VOLUMENS, his works of vivid colors, malleable, and ambiguous forms resemble body parts, organs, biomorphic forms, and sculptural abstractions.Over the last year, the artist conceived the works presented in the show through the connections they establish with each other. Although volumetry is widely used in the paintings, the shapes that compose the elements represented have a certain malleability, as if they were metamorphosing. Thus, the paintings share similarities, whether thematic or formal, which shown together, highlight the artist's poetic journey and the developments of his pictorial investigations.In Parigi's words: “I draw and paint figures aiming to transfigure bodies and pre-established ideas, confusion of genres and the exploration of boundaries between real or simulated images. Bodies are fused and remodeled to transform the canvas or paper surfaces, where containments and expansions are negotiated within the physical limits of the support.”The exhibition includes references to artists and movements in art history, especially Surrealism, which celebrates its centenary this year. The ambiguity of the forms and their exuberant coloring give the compositions a dreamlike and absurd aspect, which is close to the proposals of the artistic avant-garde. Parigi points out that the development of the works was a kind of dive into his own subconscious: ""My work emerges from the conflict between reality and fiction. Through drawings, paintings, and performances I explore a universe of self-imagined fiction, inhabited by hybrid or androgynous figures of strange beauty, forms that inhabit the surface like living bodies that could even breathe or move.""",Rodolpho Parigi: VOLUMENS,"511 W 21st Street, NY 10011",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 2 May  - 8 Jun 2024

Cultivating her own radical sensibility in early experiments, she alluded to the virtuosity of Brassaï, Roy DeCarava, Diane Arbus, and Robert Frank. These artists set a tempo upon which Smith developed her own dexterity in portraiture, landscape, and street photography—highly attuned to the textures, geometries, and thrums pulsing through every spectrum of life. She recognized the haunting allure of an oil-slicked roadside and the liquid lightning of brass instruments in musicians’ animated hands.Smith listens through her camera, sensitive to the harmony and dissonance that enliven her subjects and surroundings. At times, it is easy to forget that she works in a static medium, since each photograph transports its viewer into the energetic nucleus of the moment she captures. Through paint application, double exposure, and low shutter speed, Smith pushes photography’s form to the point of its brim and break. Like harnessing a memory, Smith underlines the evanescent—at once vivid and obscure.About Ming SmithMing Smith (b. 1947, Detroit, Michigan) is an artist living and working in Harlem, New York. She became a photographer when she was given a camera at a young age. She was the first female member to join Kamoinge, a collective of Black photographers in New York in the 1960s who documented Black life. In 2023, MoMA presented Projects: Ming Smith, a survey of the artist’s photography from the 1970s through her most recent work. Smith was included in Going Dark: The Contemporary Figure at the Edge of Visibility at the Guggenheim Museum, and Soul of a Nation at Tate Modern in collaboration with Brooklyn Museum, Crystal Bridges and The Broad. She was also featured in Brooklyn Museum’s We Wanted A Revolution: Black Radical Women, 1965-85. Her work was exhibited in conjunction with Arthur Jafa’s A Series of Utterly Improbable, Yet Extraordinary Renditions at Serpentine Galleries, London; Julia Stoschek Collection, Berlin; Galerie Rudolfinum, Prague and Moderna Museet, Stockholm. Smith’s work is in the collections of MoMA, the Whitney Museum of Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Detroit Institute of Arts, Virginia Museum of Fine Art, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, and the National Museum of African-American History and Culture.

These images are further processed with the first mainstream 'black and white' filter on mobile photography, before being transferred on velvet and mounted on canvas, taking the form of photographic paintings. Within this framework, the artist uses repetition as an aesthetic and discursive device to examine the conditions whereby a picture becomes viral, the source of collective affect, or a symbol of obsolescence, questioning the neurosis of authenticity via successive procedures of copying, pasting, repeating – a machine of syntactic production, no longer tied to the logic of indexical image making.",Ana Viktoria Dzinic: Repetitive,"12A Vyner Street, E2 9DG",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 27 Mar  - 2 Jun 2024

Influenced by the writings of the Caribbean postcolonial theorist and poet, Édouard Glissant, she examines the complexities of cultural reinvention using motifs borrowed from nature. Her practice blurs the boundary between sculpture and performance – as evidenced by Woven Bodies, a hanging, wearable sculpture made from knotted and woven nylon cloth adorned with found objects. Moving between opacity and transparency, her choices of material suggest both resilience and nuanced fragility while weaving a rich web of intersectional storytelling. Weber’s first site-specific, public commission, Cycles of Unmasking, was displayed at Somerset House, in 2023, and her first museum solo show will open in Germany, at the Kunstmuseum Bochum, this June.The paintings of Matheus Marques Abu are influenced by his ancestry, spirituality and the daily lives of those of the African diaspora in Brazil. Focusing on the Atlantic Ocean as a site of memory, Marques Abu explores the interwoven colonial and Afro-Atlantic histories, by placing the sea, nature and the Ghanaian Adinkra ideograms as central figures within his work. Drawn to the Adinkra symbol, Sankofa, represented as a bird and translated as ‘go back and pick up’, Marques Abu sets white birds wheeling between youthful figures, iron railings and native plants afloat in a wash of green, white and blue brushstrokes.These elements form connecting links to the past while offering new pathways of interpretation for the future. Marques Abu’s expert manipulation of multiple narratives draws the viewer into a nostalgic realm where powerful dialogues between past, present and future become possible.Working mainly in photography and film allows artist Dafe Oboro to explore a multifaceted approach to storytelling. Drawing upon fashion motifs and popular culture, Oboro uses sound and imagery to contemplate questions of masculinity, movement across time and space and the socio-political state of contemporary Nigeria. Oboro aims to destabilize the often-reductive representation of Africa in mainstream media to provide a more nuanced engagement with cultural realities. The richly visual essay, Lagos Still Moves, captures mundane moments against the vibrant backdrop of the local scenery, while examining the sartorial traditions amongst which today’s Nigerians have grown up with. In the outstanding series Pour me Water, Pure Water, Oboro’s revelatory imagery frames moments of locals bathing on the streets after a long day’s work. These dynamic images of the everyday ritual of bathing underscore the essential privilege of access to running water. In 2022-23, Oboro was the winner of the Access ART X Prize by Art X Lagos, following which the artist completed a three-month residency at Gasworks, London.Emergent Energies includes photographic works by Gosette Lubondo, a rising star of contemporary African photography. Lubondo’s contemplative photographs explore memory, time and heritage. Her work is influenced by her great-uncle and her father, both renowned Congolese photographers. In her series Imaginary Trip and Land of Milk, Land of Honey, Lubondo shoots in old, abandoned buildings. In so doing, she reveals how these time-haunted places still retain vivid auras of the past. By repeatedly layering contemporary characters, including herself, within her scenes, Lubondo re-animates these emptied spaces and plays with the plasticity of time. Her composite creations shed light on the inner ‘soul’ of her selected sites, emphasising the disorienting discontinuities brought about by rapid changes in Congolese society. Here, where the mysterious past informs the present tense, Lubondo rekindles memories that invite the viewer to imagine new journeys while experiencing the emotions these atmospheric spaces evoke.Artist Eysau Telayneh creates captivating abstract paintings filled with his reflections on contemporary life in the vibrant cultural hub of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. By keenly observing his local environment, Telayneh uncovers behavioural patterns and rhythms which he transposes onto his canvases, remarking that this source of inspiration means he never stops absorbing visual stimuli. His passion for mathematics and physics adds further impetus to the colours and textures appearing in these paintings, which balance gestural strokes with geometric lines and forms to create dynamic compositions. Through the layered application of vibrant hues, Telayneh examines how colours articulate different emotions and interpretations across various cultures. Telayneh’s paintings reveal his fascination with colour as an inner expression of the exterior world, stating ‘creating art, for me, is about expressing colour.’Lastly, photographic works by Zana Masombuka - a.k.a. ‘Ndebele Superhero’ - a South African visual artist will be shown. Drawing inspiration from her upbringing in the small town of Siyabuswa, in rural KwaNdebele. Masombuka references Ali A. Mazrui’s statement that Africans need to interpret their history themselves and seek to re-invent Africa on their own terms. In her series entitled, 2009: Namba S’khambe, she explores the politics of a ‘seat at the table’ and how capitalism and inequity inform the dynamics of engagement for all institutional paradigms. The visual tones in the photographs are inspired by the YInMn blue colour, serendipitously discovered in 2009, by which Masombuka comments on power associations using the colour. Set against these layers, Masombuka uses Ndebele symbols of rebirth – the cutting of hair – to symbolise the preparation of the subject’s movement into an unknown space of existence, leaving behind projected ideas of what is, what is not, and, just as importantly, whatever lies in-between.",Emergent Energies,"24 Old Gloucester Street, Bloomsbury, WC1N 3AL",Tue-Sat 12.30pm-5.30pm, 30 May  - 29 Jun 2024

René, with her eponymous gallery in Paris, played a pivotal role in promoting abstract and kinetic art during the mid-20th century, recognising the potential of both Vasarely and Agam early in their careers. In 1955, together with Vasarely, and art historian Pontus Hultén, René curated the influential group exhibition, Le Mouvement, which ignited a fresh perspective on kinetic art. This landmark event introduced a cohort of emerging younger artists such as Agam, Soto, Bury, and Tinguely, while juxtaposing their burgeoning artworks with those of established masters like Calder, Duchamp, and Vasarely himself. Ten years later, the artists participated together in MoMA’s 1965 blockbuster exhibition, The Responsive Eye, where they exhibited alongside Josef Albers, Agnes Martin, and Frank Stella. The exhibition introduced Kinetic and Optical art to America, consecrating the movement, and inaugurating new frontiers for the study of perspective.Born in Hungary in 1906, Victor Vasarely is widely recognised as the ‘grandfather’ of Op Art and leader of the movement. Originally training in medical science, Vasarely then turned his eye to visual art, approaching it with a will of method and objectivity not dissimilar to that of a scientist. After initial infatuations with Cubism, Futurism, and Symbolism, Vasarely developed his signature style in the late 1940s, a blend of geometrical forms, colours, and repetitive patterns that examined the way human brains absorb and process visual information. In Tridim Har, 1980, Vasarely challenges the viewer’s perception of reality through a juxtaposition of several cubes in a myriad of colours, crafting an optical illusion and fracturing the perspective plane. Fascinated by technology, physics, and sci-fi, Vasarely’s intuitions and theories helped define the psychedelic culture of the 1960s, leading to developments in neuroscience, quantum physics and experimental psychology. By this time, he had created and patented his Plastic Unit, the basis of his Plastic Alphabet.Yaacov Agam was born in Israel (at the time Mandate Palestine) in 1928 before moving permanently to Zürich in 1949 and then on to Paris in 1951. In Zürich, he studied at the Kunstgewerbe Schule, under the renowned colour theorist Johannes Itten and was greatly inspired by the creations of Swiss artist Max Bill. Similarly to Vasarely, Agam was also an inventor and was interested in exploring the relationship between art and the viewer. Whilst principally a multimedia artist, he is most celebrated for his creation of the Agamograph; an artwork that incorporates several images that are sliced into strips and interlaced together to illustrate different images depending on the angle from which it is viewed. Paris, 1990-1991 is indicative of this concept as the boldly coloured picture plane is fractured in multiple surfaces and shapeshifts according to the viewer’s engagement with the work. Agam takes Vasarely’s concept of optical distortion one step further by blurring the boundaries between painting and sculpture.Today, both Vasarely and Agam are hailed as pioneering icons of Post-War Art. Their ground-breaking approaches to art making continue to inspire new generations of artists to push the boundaries of what is possible, challenging conventions and revolutionising both Kinetic and Abstract Lenticular art by redefining the way we perceive and interact with art.",Vasarely/Agam: In Pursuit of Op,"21 Conduit Street, W1S 2XP",Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, 6 Mar  - 30 Aug 2024

The exhibited artists challenge the Western canon by overtly reconfiguring renowned paintings to include Black protagonists or, more covertly, portraying figures in poses reminiscent of pre-twentieth-century European portraiture. Certain works also demonstrate a tendency among Black artists to distort, simplify, or caricature the image of a Black person – either to draw attention to negative stereotypes or to imagine Black bodies extending beyond imposed limitations.In the wake of the Black Lives Matter Movement in 2020, the exhibition places importance on voices that have historically been disregarded. Although figuration has been constant throughout art history, figurative work by Black artists only recently rose to prominence. Such work contributes to the understanding of racialised experiences and the diverse self-perceptions of Black people.This exhibition contributes to the ongoing conversations around the position of figuration by Black artists. Curator, Alayo Akinkugbe, states that “it is crucial to acknowledge that this exhibition doesn’t exist in isolation but is, in part, a response to events leading up to and since 2020 which have opened up more space for dialogues around Blackness.” Opera Gallery invites you to take part in this critical conversation with ‘The Whole World Smiles with You.’",The Whole World Smiles With You,"65-66 New Bond Street, W1S 1RW",Mon-Sat 10am-6.30pm, 29 May  - 26 Jun 2024

Since the 1990s, he has pursued a meticulous and disciplined daily drawing practice, creating works whose vivid images are filled with poetry and observation; while each individual drawing is an intimate gem in its own right, it also serves as part of an incredible over-arching and open-ended narrative. Londoño’s work has previously been shown at institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the 2013 Venice Biennale. The curator of this year’s edition, Adriano Pedrosa, also included his work at the XXIV Bienal de São Paulo, 1999, and in the exhibition F[r]icciones, 2000, at Museo Reina Sofía, Madrid.In 2014, Londoño decided to structure his year through a series of weekly themes, dedicating his daily drawings to a particular subject; the exhibition includes drawings from each of the 52 weeks. The artist selected the diverse range of subjects having looked back on his previous work over the years and identified recurring themes and topics he wished to revisit. The first weeks of the year are represented by Planos (Blueprints), Personajes (Characters), Wallpapers, and Cajas (Boxes); other subjects include El Conejo (The Rabbit), Vestidos (Dresses), Cielos Oscuros (Dark Skies), Perros (Dogs), La Línea Punteada (The Dotted Line), Jacob y el Angel (Jacob and the Angel), Canciones (Songs), Barcos (Boats), Dirigibles (Airships), and Abstracto (Abstract). For over three decades on the 19th of each month, Londoño has drawn Edgar Degas, one of his greatest artistic heroes, who was born on 19 July 1834. Week 39 is titled Le Maître Absolut, Degas (The Absolute Master, Degas) and includes three drawings inspired by the great French Impressionist.Through his lifelong devotion to drawing, Londoño’s work takes inspiration from a dazzling variety of visual and textual sources. From illustrations, paper scraps and photographs (JASL does not own a computer) to classical texts and pop songs, the artist synthesises these with a methodology born of his scientific training, and his childhood obsession with an illustrated Larousse encyclopaedic dictionary. Celebrated in his homeland, and hugely influential on a younger generation of Colombian artists, including Johanna Calle, Mateo López, Nicolás Paris, and Bernardo Ortiz, Londoño’s work can be found in museum collections including those of MoMA and the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the Courtauld Gallery in London and the Albertina in Vienna. He continues to live in his hometown of Medellín, Colombia, and for the last twenty years, he has run a weekly portrait-drawing group there, as well as printing his etchings at a local workshop.","José Antonio Suárez Londoño.

Pace,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/kiki-kogelnik-the-dance/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Kiki Kogelnik,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/kiki-kogelnik/,"This exhibition, whose title draws inspiration from the allegorical Danse Macabre, or the Dance with Death, will include works across various mediums that are emblematic of Kogelnik’s profound exploration of the future possibilities—and perils—of outer space, and her relationship to the altered and abstracted twentieth-century body. Incorporating work spanning three decades of production, The Dance showcases Kogelnik’s unique, futuristic visual language as a means in which to communicate the universal fragility of terrestrial life.Kogelnik's singular visual language of weightless bodies, geometric repetition, and vibrant, neon colours defies categorisation. Born in Austria in 1935, she relocated to New York in the early 196Os, where she was introduced to artists including Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, and Tom Wesselmann. Charged by the city's artistic vitality-set against the pervasive background of the Cold War and Space Race-Kogelnik's practice surged into a prolific phase of creative development. Alongside her distinctive 'Kiki' style of painting, her assemblages proposed mechanical augmentation of the body as a means of survival, using novel materials such as sheet vinyl, plastics, and fibreglass. A shift in Kogelnik's work throughout the course of the 197Os and 8Os saw her treatment of the female body become more pronounced, concurrent with her growing dissatisfaction of the artistic scene's 'boys club'. With dynamic fluidity across paintings, works on paper, and ceramics, her explicit commentaries on the representations of women in modern society are imbued with an irony, critique, and pessimism that diverge ideologically from the canonical Pop art of her counterparts.Pace's upcoming exhibition in London will include a suite of chromatic paintings that speak to Kogelnik's fascination with space travel and her desire to be free. Bomb for Alfonso (1962), last seen at the 59th Biennale di Venezia, Brutal in Outer Space (c. 1962-63), and Untitled (Skull) (1960-63), encapsulate Kogelnik's mixed sentiments to the burgeoning technologies of the 1960s. In these paintings, silhouetted figures and disembodied limbs hover amongst falling bombs, pink skulls, and flattened silver spheres. Any sense of morbidity suggested by their composition is offset by their gleefully psychedelic palette of teals, tangerines, crimsons, and mauves.From 1964, Kogelnik began incorporating objects onto the surface of her canvases as three-dimensional augmentation to the bodies they depicted. Artificial Man and Artificial Woman (both 1965), two paintings not seen since the artist's solo exhibition in 1965 at the Austrian Institute, New York, have recently been reassembled and will also be on view. A long, twisting hose hangs from the chest of the orange male form, who, additionally, sports four arms and a disconnected limb suggestive of a 'spare part'. In lieu of an internal organ, a clear, plastic love heart is affixed to the green wire that is encased in the piping. A similar length of tube extends from the torso of the entirely deconstructed female figure, as she floats amidst her three arms and four legs.To create these life-size forms that populate her paintings, Kogelnik traced around bodies-sometimes her own, and sometimes those of her acquaintances-in a process akin to photography that she described as 'taking'. Enhancing their mechanistic quality, the tape Kogelnik used to secure her cutouts remains delineated, suggesting that the figures and their extra limbs resemble both garments for paper dolls and integral components of a larger machine.In a large-scale sculpture included in the exhibition, titled Seventh Ave. People (1986), flat, outlined bodies produced on sheet vinyl drape on hangers that suspend from a clothing rail, perhaps suggesting that identity is something that can be slipped on or off at will. Kogelnik's first studio in New York was not far from the Garment District on 7th Avenue, whose rush of clothing racks, tailors, and designers was a dynamic source of inspiration for the artist. Uncoupled from distinctions of sex, gender, or race, these vibrantly coloured cutouts offer the joy of Kogelnik's world and sixties-era utopianism. Yet, the threat of death in this-and Kogelnik's other hanging works-cannot be escaped. Like flayed skins, these depleted bodies portend a post-atomic world that is subject at any moment to weapons of mass destruction. By fusing the imagery of memento mori with symbolically optimistic materials, like vinyl, Kogelnik's works manifest life and death on the edge of destruction.For Kogelnik, the body that would survive the future was something that could be engineered, cloned, and automated. Like her cutouts, she produced figurative imprints using anatomically accurate stamps of the body, bone structure, circulatory system, and inner organs. A body of twelve drawings included in The Dance that feature these stamps portray their eponymous Robots in narrative sequence: their creation; their ascension into space and journey to other planets; the nirvana of celestial travel and their subsequent transformation; and finally, their fall and destruction. Circles permeate these works, from the glowing spheres around which body parts orbit, to smaller, clustered beads redolent of medical blister packs.In the early 1970s, Kogelnik departed from depictions of androgynous bodies, instead sourcing her models from advertisements or fashion editorials, and focusing on the archetypes of femininity circulated in mass media. The painting On the Beach (1973), included in the exhibition, imitates the wide format of a billboard: like shop mannequins, the women in this painting model swimwear and summer dresses while holding stiff, unnatural poses. Like the ceramics also on view, their faces are mask-like. Blank, cutout eyes, boldly outlined lips, and smooth, flat surfaces assert the artificiality of the female ideal. Just as Kogelnik envisioned Space utopias, she likewise revealed the culturally constructed expectations of women's bodies as fantasy, otherwise expressed by her often-repeated maxim, ""art comes from artificial, because it is not nature.""Concurrent with The Dance, Kogelnik is the subject of a major retrospective at Kunsthaus Zurich, on through July 14, 2024. In Paris, three ceramic sculptures by the artist are included in the exhibition Le monde comme ii va (The World as It Goes), at The Pinault Collection, Bourse de commerce, on through September 2, 2024.",Kiki Kogelnik: The Dance,"5 Hanover Square, W1S 1HQ",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 24 May  - 3 Aug 2024

The show will incorporate installation and sculptures—one of which is enlivened by animatronic technology—that are imbued with an enigmatic pathos that has become emblematic of Elmgreen & Dragset’s oeuvre.As the backdrop for their presentation, Elmgreen & Dragset chose a quotation by the late Danish poet Inger Christensen:A desert can be so desolate that nobody knows it exists.Printed on the gallery’s rear wall, the sentence hovers in the sky above a desert, setting the scene for the artists’ exploration into landscapes that are more emotional than physical. The vast horizon looks like a still from a road trip movie.Forming a rhythmic structural base to the exhibition, five street signs stand evenly spaced in front of the billboard-like print, almost resembling a cluster of trees. While their shapes are familiar and universal—circles, squares, and triangles—they have no instructions, no warnings, or directions. The upper panel of each sign depicts clouds on a blue sky, whereas the lower panels are made of mirror-polished steel, reflecting the gallery and the visitors. This reflection of the space turns the signs into chameleons; they become their surroundings, they become us. We are left to find our own way.Opposite the signs, two hands made of white lacquered bronze protrude from the wall, holding a small blackbird. Upon closer inspection, viewers will notice the bird’s subtle, nearly imperceptible, breathing. It is a scene of fragility—perhaps a child trying to save a small dying creature.Next to the reception desk stand a pair of green rainboots. Perforated with circular holes and cast in bronze, they provide no protection from rain.Towards the entrance of the gallery, visitors will encounter two further artworks. A realistic figure of a boy concentrates on piecing a puzzle together. It seems as if the finished puzzle will also reveal a blue sky with clouds. Not far from the boy, a small bird’s nest sits inside a museum vitrine. Within the nest lies a tiny book entitled “How to Become a Bird.”The slightly surreal imagery in many of these artworks is a familiar feature of Elmgreen & Dragset’s practice. Since their first sculpture, a diving board piercing through the panoramic window of the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (Powerless Structures, Fig. 11, 1997), they have created numerous works that offer viewers an opportunity to experience everyday objects in new and often uncanny ways. Many might know the artist duo’s well-known work, Prada Marfa (2005), a fully stocked but permanently closed luxury goods boutique located in the middle of the West Texan desert.Before he became a visual artist, Michael Elmgreen wrote the following poem:While birds are crossing the linebetween mountain and skyYou stand on the soil onsoil so firmly pressedbecause home iswhat you were toldshould be solidYou don’t turn aroundBecause home iswhat you were toldwhile birds are crossingHome is the place you left",Elmgreen & Dragset: Landscapes,"Quai des Bergues 15-17, CH-1201",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 23 May  - 10 Aug 2024  
Palmer,London,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/land-sea-air/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Carolina Aguirre,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/carolina-aguirre/,"Land, Sea, Air brings together a group of emerging artists whose work engages with ecology and the natural landscape. The selected artists are all interested in capturing the essence of our natural world, focusing on one (or any combination) of land, sea, and air. The title’s military connotations chime with the history of the Palmer Gallery building (once a factory in which parts for the Spitfire, Hurricanes and Lancaster Bombers were built during the Second World War), and alludes to the tensions between the natural and non-natural that are present in each of the artists’ work. Land, Sea, Air celebrates the natural abundance of our planet and examines the relationship between these fragile ecological systems and human life. Humanity is inextricably linked with the natural world, enmeshed in a complex system it falsely appears to have transcended. As our weather systems grow more erratic, and our climates more inhospitable, young artists of today are perhaps more aware of this brittle balance than any previous generation.Carolina Aguirre’s textured wood board works have a geological feel. She utilises the mineral sheen of Sumi ink, the sticky, bodily gloss of shellac (made from the female Lac beetle), the smokiness of charcoal and the chalkiness of Gofun (made from crushed up seashells) to create surfaces reminiscent of cave paintings. They have an elemental, ancient aesthetic emphasised by an earthy, rustic palette.Max Boyla’s swirling, gaseous, satin canvases have an ambiguous quality which drifts between pure abstraction and natural landscape, swinging between sea and sky. As a composite material made from natural and non-natural materials, satin is the perfect canvas to think about environmental balance. His work uses material to draw attention to the contrast between sustainable and unsustainable products, and how ‘green’ and ‘un-green’ living are so often woven together in our society.Shaan Bevan typically draws turbulent seascapes that are intended to mirror the internal state of her body when she was undergoing treatment for Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. She made one drawing for each level of the Beaufort scale, attempting to capture the power of the wind and equate that with a body in revolt. Shaan will present a large-scale iron work that has been periodically sprayed with water, causing it to oxidise and form a beautifully patinated surface.Sean Savage Ferrari utilises assemblage techniques to juxtapose found materials. His hybrid works are rooted in the earth and natural materials. During an artist residency in the Amazon rainforest, he began making works from seeds, soil, nuts and berries paired with found pieces of plastic (like discarded fishing nets). Here he uses wheat stems, which are dried, flattened, and combined to make tactile sheets. These are arranged on rough-textured paper made from pulped grass clippings and framed with wood from discarded pal- lets, forging a visual narrative of re-use and recycling.Throughout the exhibition the artists repeatedly challenge viewers’ perceptions of ecologies and the positioning of human beings within environments. Connie Harrison does this by rejecting the traditional rules of landscape painting, eschewing traditional perspective in favour of a prismatic approach to composition that blossoms from a central point in the canvas. Kavitha Balasingham’s sculptural installations take the form of flowers and butterflies, engaging the natural world. The organic forms are often 3D printed and have an electrical component, tapping into a tension between the organic and non-organic.Grace Woodcock’s predominately sculptural practice is rooted in the interwoven threads between biology and sci-fi. Wooden forms often make up the basis of the works, before fabric is stretched over them and solidified through layers of primer and oil paint. Fluid, natural forms twist and ripple, using a mixture of organic and synthetic materials to echo elements of the natural environment. Finally, Action Pyramid is a sound artist who records elements of the natural world. His most recent project saw him place hydrofoil microphones under the River Lea, live streaming the sound recording on- line. In Land, Sea, Air he will present an audio recording of underwater plants during the process of photosynthesis.","Land, Sea, Air","15 Hatton Street, NW8 8PL","Tue-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 12-5pm", 24 May  - 13 Jul 2024  
Parrasch heijnen,Los Angeles,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/lois-dodd-ellen-siebers/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Lois Dodd,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/lois-dodd/,"Lois Dodd (b. 1927, Montclair, NJ) is known for her potent paintings, made en plein air, of the natural world - most often of specimens encountered throughout her Mid-Coast Maine property. In Dodd’s works, trees and branches are framed against the sky, cutting and darting across tonal grounds (Elm Tree in December, 2020); flowering plants stand at attention in bud and bloom (Mayberry, 2023 and Apple Tree in Bloom - May, 2021); seed pods and pine cones are depicted at close range, a study of their natural geometries (Dried Pods, 2022 and Pine Cone, 2023). The artist’s long-term pursuit of beauty is depicted in each work through a series of the quick-succession decisions necessitated by her single-sitting, plein air methodology.Dodd’s palette is fantastical, barely: each image seems to be rendered to express what she feels as much as what she sees during her deeply observational process. In a 2007 conversation with Bill Maynes, Dodd described her experience employing this strategy, “Not everybody seems to see the world that they’re living in… and it’s such a kick, really seeing things.” Impossibly fluorescent greens, luminous mauve, and porous aqua resonate in a harmonious evocation of the richness, the lushness, of the living world. Dodd’s paintings, encapsulations of a painter’s view of her world, put plain beauty on full display.Ellen Siebers (b. 1986, Madison, WI) makes highly atmospheric, evocative paintings, with an eye, too, toward life, nature, and quotidian phenomena. In Siebers’ works and process, memory plays a central role; rather than employing a strict plein air strategy, as Dodd does, Siebers’ paintings are often descriptions of scenes or experiences which she studied and reflected upon at length. Siebers has described this process as one which demands practice: looking and seeing - two related but distinct acts - come before rehearsing and testing her memory, all in anticipation of returning to the studio to develop and render her paintings. In works like dusk, 2024, a J.M.W. Turner-esque image of a glowing sun setting over its own reflection, Siebers’ palette calls to mind a recollection of a vista; Payne’s grey and burnt umber set the dusky stage, and a raw sienna orb floats downward, toward its counterpart below.Much as in Dodd’s works, Siebers’ paintings call a feeling to mind. In plums, 2024, cool light illuminates round fruits on an indeterminate surface, recalling the preciousness of stone fruit before spring’s arrival - a balm, and reminder of anticipated plentitude, in the barren winter months. Similarly, two moths, 2024, uses strategies of illumination - imagine a candle, excluded in Siebers’ framing, brightening the forms from below, as in Georges de la Tour’s baroque works; and, above, consider the rich, warm, evening light, “magic hour” - to evoke a sensation of awe. Siebers’ unique, trademark mode of painterly looseness, most readily visualized by conspicuous brushstrokes and striations of her brushes’ fibers, allows a viewer a moment’s glimpse into the pull of her forearm or flick of her wrist through the developing image, wrought with feeling engendered by the distance of observational memory.As Siebers considers her long standing appreciation for Dodd’s works and practice, she notes that “Observation gives way to the importance of each brush stroke, in devotion to process.” Lois Dodd and Ellen Siebers undeniably share a mutual interest in not just the fundamentals of painting but the beauty of their earthly surroundings. With an eye toward this affinity, Siebers has noted:“The impulse to create work that relates to the concept of beauty has at times felt vulnerable. Unlike historically male counterparts, when a woman is interested in beauty it is often linked to femininity or sentimentality…. However, historically when they are tied to women artists, those concepts lack intellectual rigor. For me, [Lois Dodd’s] work challenges this, never paying it any mind. This helped inspire me to consider the idea of beauty as a serious conceptual conceit.”To that end, in both Dodd’s and Siebers’ works, images of life – animal, vegetable, mineral – are rendered, often transforming the quotidian into something extraordinary. At the root, both Ellen Siebers and Lois Dodd are engaged with and participating in the millenias-long tradition of their media. Their works revel in the possibility of beauty and visual poetry - and the capacity to depict a fleeting experience or sensation - in each lived moment.Lois Dodd has dedicated over seven decades to capturing her immediate surroundings at home in Manhattan’s Lower East Side, rural Mid-Coast Maine, and the Delaware Water Gap. Dodd studied at the Cooper Union in the late 1940s. She was one of the five founding members of the legendary Tanager Gallery, among the first artist-run cooperative galleries in New York, and is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Academy. Since 1954, her work has been the subject of over seventy one-person exhibitions. Her small, intimate paintings are typically completed in a single plein-air sitting, featuring varied subjects like New England outbuildings, vibrant summer gardens, dried plants, moonlit skies, and interior window views. Dodd revisits familiar motifs throughout the year, yielding dramatically different results. As Lucy R. Lippard emphasizes, Dodd’s paintings are “like small poems composed with deceptively simple words,” resonating with viewers long after the initial encounter. Lois Dodd's exhibition is presented in cooperation with Alexandre Gallery, New York.Ellen Siebers is a painter based in Hudson, NY. She received her BFA from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2008 and her MFA from the University of Iowa in 2012. Siebers was awarded the Elizabeth Greenshields Grant (2023), Vermont Studio Center Grant (2014), the University of Iowa Quarter-time Teaching Assistantship (2009-12), the Iowa Quarter-time Fellowship (2009), and the Mildred Pelzer Lynch Fellowship (2011-12).

Stranger Things (2023), the painting that lends its title to the exhibition, shows three female characters in what seems to be a night club. However, many details in this picture tend to contradict our initial assumptions and, in a classic Hausner’s manner, leave once more the narrative ambivalent and open to interpretations. What exactly is that place with a curious painted floor? What brings these three characters together in this picture? Are the gestures between the two younger women an expression of their sexual attraction? In fact, the female characters Hausner portrays embody all genders and play various roles – like actors they explore a variety of relationships.Staging is critical in Hausner‘s work, her paintings hint at narratives beyond the frame, while foreclosing the possibility of a complete reading. Bodies are entangled, their relations imbued with a sense of intimacy and urgency in fragments of a story, comparable to film stills whose plot has gone missing, they defy clear interpretation. Narratives of exile and displacement are intimated in different forms – the unusual shaped-canvas used for Double Dip creates a salient focus on the current social disruption and points out this fragmentation – in the literal sense of the word – through the central figure which is headless. Hands reach for other hands, whether seeking help or experiencing rejection. Despite its luminously shimmering colors, the duality of the scene in Deep Water (2024) cannot divert from the drama it depicts through a boat used by migrants who might still be hidden under the beautiful blanket that covers part of its deck. The artist seems to be playing with the old saying “still waters run deep”.Three new sculptures echo the themes and figures in the paintings. In Spill (2024), a professionally attired female figure is slicked with what appears to be crude oil. A bird drenched in the same viscous black liquid perches upon her head, as she holds on to a red and white life-ring. Atemluft (2024), which means “A Breath of Air,” addresses air pollution. In Xenia Hausner’s own words: “Atemluft is a concrete image of desperation, a struggle for what we need the most in order to live. What are we losing? What have we put at risk?”. As in the paintings, these are scenes of outreach, of attempts at salvage in a turbulent world. In their ambiguous echoing of present realities, the works extend a quiet, connecting thread to the lyrical title of this year’s Venice Biennale, Foreigners Everywhere.Xenia Hausner (b. 1951 in Vienna, Austria) studied stage design at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and worked as a set designer for much of her early career.

For Fishing the World, as the title indicates, the artist remains true to her exploration of our planet. The exhibition showcases pieces from her latest series entitled Call Me Ishmael, taking its name from the opening sentence of Melville’s iconic novel Moby Dick. Imbued by the novel’s symbolism, biblical as well as fictional, the artist’s new body of work is rich in metaphors that softly slip into our imagination like a weaving.Before creating the series Call me Ishmael, Bouvier Ausländer crafted sculptural net-like structures, which serve as objects of their own as well as stencils for her paintings. For Call Me Ishmael, the artist places these grid-like sculptures onto various supports, such as maps, newspapers, tissue and Japanese paper, then sprays gouache paint over them to transfer a ghostly image, or shadow of the netting. These nets loom in variations in all the new works, resembling a moving grid that appears, fades and vanishes, similar to a fisherman’s net in the water.The sea setting and its symbolism in Melville’s novel are echoed in the recent series through the use of sprayed and diluted gouache in flowing and effusive compositions. Expressive lines and shapes capture the tumultuous atmosphere of Melville’s narrative. Rather than confining herself to the deep blue sea shade, the artist explores a spectrum of colours - pink, green, and yellow - sputtered, sprinkled and squirted onto the various media to mesmerising visual effects. As in the former series, fragments of the underlying maps or newspaper print occasionally peak through to offer yet another dimension in the work and its appreciation.The interplay of physical and psychological dimensions is central to Bouvier Ausländer’s research. The enlivened grid, or wafting net reshapes to a membrane that permeates between the image, its metaphors and our senses, between our inner and outer worlds. The narrator’s identity in Moby Dick remains elusive. Similarly, Bouvier Ausländer steps back from proposing how our planet is shaped. Instead, she invites us on a multisensory journey to fish for the complexities of our world.Sophie Bouvier Ausländer has held numerous solo and group shows in Switzerland, France and the UK. Her works entered important institutional collections such as the Musee d’Art de Pully and the Musée des Beaux-Arts du Locle.

Perrotin,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/johan-creten-strangers-welcome/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perrotin-New-York.jpg,Johan Creten,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/johan-creten/,"The following is an essay written by Leigh Arnold for Johan Creten's newest catalogue, titled Strangers Welcome, which will be released concurrent to the opening of his exhibition at Perrotin New York.A large white whale in the middle of a green sea.Johan Creten’s description of the setting for his 2023 solo exhibition Le Coeur qui déborde (The Overflowing Heart) at the Abbaye de Beaulieu-en-Rouergue poetically references the unadorned Romanesque architecture of the 12th-century Cistercian abbey (notably, the white stone that comprises it) and the lush forest surrounding it, and effectively sets the scene for his “oceanic” exhibition of recent ceramic, resin, and bronze sculptures. In literature, the “white whale” refers to the central antagonist of Herman Melville’s 1851 epic novel, Moby-Dick, which follows a sea captain’s obsessive quest for vengeance against the natural instincts of a colossal leviathan. In the years since Moby-Dick’s publishing, the “white whale” has become synonymous with an obsession that is relentlessly pursued. Such could describe Creten’s own efforts to elevate ceramics to the level of “high art” within the realm of contemporary sculpture—a pursuit he took up nearly 40 years ago. Trained as a painter, Creten’s interest in clay began when he discovered an abandoned ceramics studio as a student at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent in the 1980s. “I chose ceramics also because nobody else was working with this material,” Creten explained, “There is a place to take [it], there is a history to write with this material. You can express things. You can talk about politics. You can talk about the world. You can talk about yourself.” Creten continues to chip away at the stale hierarchies that often denigrate media associated with use value or craft, like clay—an inexpensive and messy material that requires hands and labor to manipulate (rather than the “clean” ideas of conceptual art that are manipulated by the mind). Renouncing popular taste and trend, Creten’s sculptures are a feast for the eyes, with their gestural, virtuosic glazes and sumptuous surfaces that also light up the mind with their enigmatic and inscrutable references. Creten challenges his viewers to embark on their own individual quest for meaning and interpretation.Returning to the “oceanic” metaphor that permeates Le Coeur qui déborde (The Overflowing Heart): throughout the nave of the church, sea beasts—cheeky mermaids, sinful sirens, and seahorses undergoing metamorphosis—perched on color coded ceramic socles, while gleaming gold bas-reliefs containing abstract patterns evocative of mollusks, oyster shells, snakes, or eels lined the walls of the damp and dark cellar. Within this motif, Creten exploits a play on words to great effect: the French homonyms la mer / la mère: the sea and the mother become the artist’s protagonists. Personifications of the sea as feminine abound in literature and poetry that symbolically link the seas and ocean to creation, fertility, and mystery, but also to chaos, tempestuousness, and irrationality. Through this lens, the patterns on Creten’s gold bas- relief sculptures begin to take on forms of female sexual anatomy and remind us of another play on words: in French, “la moule” (mussel) is vulgar slang for vagina. The ambiguity in these wall-based works—are they representations of la mer or la mère? —is a leitmotif found in many of the artist’s sculptures, from the Odore di Femmina series, first shown in 1991, to his series of Waves for Palissy, begun in 2004, to the more recent bas-relief sculptures Relief IV (2012) or Vulva (2017).Creten installed the Éloge de l’ombre bas-reliefs at the same elevation along the cellar walls, creating a ribbon of gold or a lustrous frieze of shimmering patterns that situates them in the realm of architectural adornment. In the context of a religious setting, gold evokes illuminated manuscripts, the halos of saints in Eastern Orthodox icons, or chalices used in the Eucharist, but here it was a stark addition given the vows of piety, poverty, and adornment the monks inhabiting this Cistercian monastery would have followed. These works also functioned to bring light into the dark cellar through their reflective surfaces. Creten purposely left this space unlit to further dramatize subtle lighting on the variegated surfaces. This strategy refers to the writings of Jun’ichirō Tanizaki (Japanese, 1886-1965), whose 1933 essay, “In Praise of Shadows” (éloge de l’ombre in French) argues that the power of beauty resides in shadow and subtlety, rather than total illumination. By limiting the lighting, Creten further emphasized the many shadows in each work, referencing taboo subjects or the many holes and crevices of the human body that can be used for sexual pleasure (a hole is a hole is a hole).Intriguingly, a single work from this series, Nr 13 (2022-23), was inset in an alcove just outside the cellar and oriented vertically, with its long sides running parallel to the walls. Unlike others from Éloge de l’ombre that are dense with patterns and lines, Nr 13 contains only three elements: two tubes on either long side, with a sphere nestled in the center. As installed in the Abbaye, the bas-relief becomes a kind of threshold, with the long tubular forms pushed aside or opened by the ball between them. In this vertical orientation it also recalls Jasper Johns’s 1958 encaustic Grey Painting with Ball in which “the upright dimension is given by a gash in the canvas, pried and held open by an intruding ball.” Johns used wooden balls in several paintings of that period to critique the masculinity typically associated with Abstract Expressionism and the notion that a painting need have “balls” to be successful. Notably Johns came up one short of typical male anatomy with Grey Painting with Ball. While Creten’s Éloge de l’ombre – Nr 13 formally resembles Johns’s painting, in the context of the surrounding bas-reliefs from the series, with their labia-like patterns and the overarching theme of the sea, the sculpture becomes representative of anatomy of the opposite sex— the slit or “gash” (each slang for vagina) formed by two tubes becomes a point of creation and mystery. Rotating the sculpture’s orientation by 90 degrees, in line with others in the series, generates even further interpretations, transforming the gleaming central sphere into an enormous pearl in the mouth of a mussel or oyster, or an eye. In that sense, the work echoes Georges Bataille’s 1928 novella Story of the Eye (l’histoire de l’œil in French), a pornographic fantasy of two lovers delving into the world of sexual fetishes and deviancy. Roland Barthes would later go on to theorize about the centrality of the eye in Bataille’s novel and its interchangeability with testicles, eggs, and other ocular objects throughout.Moving into the nave of the church, the bestiary Creten created for his 2022 exhibition at La Piscine – musée d'art et d'industrie André Diligent de Roubaix continues with new humanoid aquatic creatures. La sirène effrontée (the naughty mermaid) and bronze La Laguna (a reference to Venice, the floating city), each feature female-coded effigies holding postures reminiscent of the Madonna in prayer. Installed around these seemingly pious characters were sculptures resembling seahorses undergoing metamorphosis to something otherworldly or hybrid in form. Their arms and hands—in some cases talon-like, while in others webbed like fish fins—ape the piety displayed by the mermaids, hinting at their true nature as beguiling and dangerous sea nymphs. In medieval bestiaries, the siren was an enchantress, who seduced, entrapped, and killed incautious and unmindful men through their propensity for causing shipwrecks. In the context of La Coeur qui déborde (The Overflowing Heart), these figures relate to ideas of sin, temptation, and the lurking dead.A sense of violence permeates many of Creten’s seahorse hybrids, as exemplified best in The Sex Addict, Pump and Dump / Satyriasis (2021-23). Featuring a kind of sea satyr resting on a socle glazed in the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue, the entire composition appears to be bleeding from a deep wound at the head or neck of the beast. Red and black glazes gush down its sides in homage to the gesture so emphatic in Abstract Expressionist painting. Even the pedestal’s colors bleed, with red dripping into the yellow band. Its title reads like a short poem that breaks down in three parts referencing a form of securities fraud or financial trickery—pumping up a stock price, only to dump it to reap the artificial rewards to the detriment of the economy—bookended by colloquial and pathological terms for sexual addiction. Altogether, The Sex Addict, Pump and Dump / Satyriasis references the type of creature Creten sculpted: a mischievous male spirit with an insatiable sexual appetite.Scattered throughout all the spaces were ceramics from Creten’s Observation Points series of hybrid sculptures / stools / pedestals, that resemble traditional bases used to display sculpture and function as seating for gallery visitors. “The hope is that you anchor your audience, to look, to turn around while they sit and see the works in a different way,” the artist describes, “And today, I think one of the greatest luxuries is time, and one of the most difficult things is how to look at things, how to calm down enough to look at things.” Creten strategically installed these works to correlate to different viewpoints. He also considers the number of Observation Points in any given space and how that will affect the dynamic and experience of his viewers: with one, there is observation; with two, there is dialogue; with three or more, there is a crowd, and so on. Their portability as stools that can simply be picked up and moved, along with their flag-like appearance, transform these objects into symbols of universal migration.In contrast to previous installations of Observation Points, the Bestiarium at Roubaix for example, the colors for those installed in the Abbaye were much more discreet, in keeping with the architecture and design of the Cistercian monastery. Creten’s previous Observation Points were glazed with bright primary colors commonly found at the circus: reds and yellows; bright pinks and blues. In contrast, Cirque 10, for example, is almost monochrome, with alternating shades of pale and grey blues recalling the iconography of Jasper Johns, whether the stars from his iconic Flag paintings or the lesser-known sculpture from 1958, while also referring to the six-pointed star in the nave of the abbey. Creten’s more subdued color palate for the observation points here suggest that this is not a place of whimsy or folly, but rather a place for somber reflection and appreciation.Creten’s Le Coeur qui déborde (The Oveflowing Heart) continues in part at Perrotin, New York as Strangers Welcome in June 2024, in a markedly different space: the “neutral” white cube gallery. Transposing the exhibition from one heart to another: the heart of one of the most remote places in France to that of the bustling contemporary art scene fulfills Creten’s desire to share these works with a wider audience (i.e., to welcome strangers to his most recent oeuvre) and in many ways further solidifies his place among the ranks of contemporary sculptors. Returning to the Moby-Dick reference that opened this essay, if Creten’s “white whale” is synonymous with the “white cube” of the contemporary art scene, it would seem he has caught it. The hybrid sculptures that populate both exhibitions—sea beasts or humans, pedestals (for display or performance) or seating (for observation or contemplation)—draw analogies to the human condition and all the dualities contained within it: sacred and secular, pious and sinful, beautiful and grotesque.— Dr. Leigh ArnoldCurator at the Nasher Sculpture Center (Dallas, TX)",Johan Creten: Strangers Welcome,"130 Orchard Street, NY 10002",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 1 Jun  - 26 Jul 2024  
Perrotin,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/charles-hascoet-kobayashi-maru/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perrotin-New-York.jpg,Charles Hascoët,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/charles-hascoet/,"Do you remember that pungent citrus smell of Calvin Klein One cologne that permeated the 1990s? For New York-based Parisian artist Charles Hascoët, the unisex CK One elicits olfactory memories of hope and innocence. In his debut solo show at Perrotin New York, Kobayashi Maru, Hascoët presents Giorgio Morandi-like still lifes featuring frosted glass flasks of CK One, colorful barbell- shaped Listerine bottles, and other curios that are unmistakably of an era and its sensual pleasures promised by the famous motto of “Purity. Unity. Sensuality.” And if these indelible mass-market 90s elixirs are not nostalgia-provoking enough, a small 2018 portrait of the cult underground electronic music artist Bogdan Raczynski wearing the t-shirt ""Rave till you cry"" will send you back to the 90s “happiness and respect” Rave culture in no time!Hascoët was raised in Paris and classically trained in painting at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris, from which he graduated in 2014, a school known for its traditional, rigorous approach. He belongs to a generation of artists—perhaps one of the last—whose fine art education was realized through in-person art critiques and studio visits, with work shared and viewed up close. Painting for Hascoët and his cohort was still painterly, an experience of lingering oil paint smells in messy object-filled ateliers— and not yet flattened by pocket-sized screens, NFTs, and the promiscuous interchangeability of viewing art on social media platforms.Indeed, Hascoët’s paintings cannot be fully appreciated until you have seen the brushstrokes, forms and textures up close. In addition to his desire to follow the tradition of figuration by extending it gesturally and abstractly, the art historical references informing his work further announce that Hascoët is a painter’s painter. In this body of work alone the attentive viewer will spot references to a wide range of figurative painters such as the 19th century French Romantic Eugene Delacroix’s reclining figures and self-portraits to Richard Diebenkorn and David Park’s mid-20th century Bay Area Figurative style portraits, still lifes, rich brushstrokes and palettes.The titular piece of the show, Kobayashi Maru (2024) portrays the artist in royal blue pajamas waking up from a nightmare with his bed-as-raft half on ocean water and half on shore, while in the distance an active volcano rages. There is danger, yes, but also escape and diversion, a tension found throughout this new body of work. The title references the famous Kobayashi Maru test which first appeared in the 1982 film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and was featured in numerous other Star Trek media. The Kobayashi Maru is a training exercise that tests Starfleet Academy cadets by forcing them to make an impossible choice: they are tasked with rescuing a threatened civilian fuel ship, but attempting to do so will provoke fatal enemy attacks on their own vessel. In the film, Captain Kirk concedes that as a cadet he rewrote the rules of the exercise, hacking and reprogramming the simulation to make it possible to save the ship. Kobayashi Maru grew to take on a double meaning in popular parlance, referring both to a no-win situation as well the incongruous belief that there is always a chance, always a way out.This palpable tension between peril and escapism, between immediate threat and deferral, is further emphasized in one of the show’s largest paintings. In The Waves (2024), Hascoët depicts himself floating on troubled waters in a vulnerable wooden boat— his body as large as the boat itself—seemingly oblivious while playing on his Gameboy. In another painting, Iceberg (2024), the artist, bundled in arctic gear, poses reclined on a floating iceberg he shares with a cuddly sleeping polar bear. This composition directly references Nicolas Poussin’s Echo and Narcissus c.1627—one of Hascoët’s favorite paintings—but is clearly updated to denote the dream-like dissociative survival mechanism we use to avoid the reality of this century’s extreme climate crisis.Hascoët approaches painting—as he described to me during a visit to his Bushwick studio in late March—sculpturally. (Unsurprisingly, he began his artistic life as a sculptor.) For the artist, this means that he understands his oil paintings as masses that occupy space, and he forms tableaux that challenge two dimensionality by positioning objects and figures in unexpected and iconoclastic ways. He explained that even the space between the paintings exposed on the wall is important to him. This physicality, this spatial sensitivity, shows up not just in his finished work but also in his process. The artist uses a plumb line as he works, an old-fashioned tool used to manually measure vertical lines and the alignment of elements, determining the center of gravity of an irregular shape. (Hascoët proudly showed off his plumb line—a beautiful yellow gold cord with a curved pointed brass weight attached to it—to me like his prized talisman.) Beyond the world of fine art, plumb lines were used by sailors to measure the depth of a body of water so as to avoid shallow waters and the dangers below. In this way, Charles Hascoët’s use of the plumb line operates for me metaphorically and practically as a means to more deeply understand the artist’s work. Hascoët is a very physical painter, obsessed with recurring water themes and sculptural bodies, objects and the self in space.The self-portraits of the artist that dominate his new works in Kobayashi Maru are large in scale and may appear primarily auto-biographical and self-referential on first view, but they operate beyond solipsism, richly and metonymically, personally and collectively. Their playful and optimistic accessibility is enhanced by references to countless millennial quirks, trends and fetishes: Furbies, the little electronic hamster/owl hybrid toys originally released in 1998; techno DJs; geek and underground culture tropes; Jaws (1975); PlayStation; Super Nintendo; X-Files; Jean- Claude Van Damme in Hard Target (1993) and other retro pop culture references.Hascoët’s imaginary worlds seem to reflect our uncomfortable contemporary moment that is plagued by isolation, irrevocable environmental destruction, doomsday spirals, and collective and generalized anxiety. Yet Hascoët’s fantastical utopian scapes and escapes are rendered with much humor and nostalgia. They show him in various stages of repose, unconsciousness and play; but looming insecurity and imperilment are ever-present. These images are not just about external threats but inner psychological struggles as well.In another painting of this Kobayashi Maru series, Shiatsu (2024), a ghostly purple blob-like monster with beady red eyes is giving the artist, seen lying relaxed on a watery-blue bed, a gentle massage. This particular creature, what Hascoët described as “an inner demon of [his] darker side,” has appeared in several of the artist’s past paintings, but what differentiates Shiatsu from other works is a tone hinting to resolution: “Here,” Hascoët said, “we seem to be getting along quite well.”- Natasha Boas",Charles Hascoët: Kobayashi Maru,"130 Orchard Street, NY 10002",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 1 Jun  - 26 Jul 2024  
Perrotin,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/alex-gardner-psychic-stamina/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perrotin-New-York.jpg,Alex Gardner,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/alex-gardner/,"Gardner’s new body of work is both inherently optimistic and wholly voracious. His paintings offer the simple yet tender notion of art as solace, through encounters that are simultaneously estranged yet achingly familiar. In America, belonging can often seem just out of reach, including for Gardner himself who is bi-racial. Such is existing in a society where each perspective has its own extremities, isolating the proverbial other. When our burdens become increasingly hard to bear, the exhibition's title, Psychic Stamina, suggests, home might simply be found in one’s own head and heart.In a country which sees itself as two colors, and where civility–like an endangered species–grows increasingly rare, Gardner’s paintings open a space of reflection. Who are we and where do we go from here?Gardner’s enigmatic work is provocative and unsettling without being confrontational, as exemplified by Endurance, the artist’s foray into sculpture which is placed at the entrance of the exhibition. The bronze bench, in the likeness of a face-down individual whose body hangs between two reflective pillars, invites visitors to answer the question of how much weight can one bear alone?This is Gardner’s undeniable strength–the ability to raise open- ended questions about our everyday life, and the realities we inhabit, leaving everything up for subjective interpretation. It seems that the prone figure is enduring but we do not know how or why he came to be in this uncomfortable position. By inviting viewers to sit on the figure, the artist is asking us to consider what toll our comfort takes on others. This is just one of the many tough questions embedded in his work.Gardner’s close-up views of cropped, featureless figures are both immediate and cryptic. Many are literally and metaphorically untethered, as in Enjoying The Ride, No Prenup For The Thrill, and Leveraged (Living in The Red). In Exploding On The Launch Pad, a barefooted toddler in reddish-orange shorts and t-shirt is inexplicably rising into the air. Set against a solid yellow ground, the painting of a bare-legged brown child in shorts and a t-shirt marked by thick, drapery-like folds can also be read as a painting of tonal relationships. As in his other paintings, the color infuses the scene with an emotional tenor, in this case, childhood exuberance. And yet, the longer we look at the painting, the more ambivalent it becomes. Why is the child rising into the air? Are the children’s playroom colors joyful? Or do they bring to mind the heat of a conflagration?While the luminous monochromatic grounds of Gardner’s paintings evoke a nameless abstract, the untethered figures seem buoyant. They embody an ambiguity, between rising and falling, comfort and disaster. They evoke an in-between moment, where we cannot deduce what happened before nor guess what will happen next. This is certainly true of Jungle (We Look Different to eachother) and Leaves Falling Gently On My Corpse, where intimate moments also feel like ones of estrangement. Gardner pulls the viewer into the tight space of his paintings.By edging the contour of the figures in pink or red, the photographic effect of halation endows his subjects with an otherworldly, spectral luminosity. They exist in a world that is adjacent to ours in recognizable attire, but at the same time, is remote and unreachable. They follow an interior logic we cannot discern, as in Jungle (We Look Different to Eachother), where two identical figures appear to be pressing their faces into each other. Another figure, who is dressed like the others, appears to be standing on her hands, suggesting we are looking at a performance.Everywhere we turn in Gardner’s pastel-colored paintings, we encounter something we cannot fully fathom. This resistance to labels conveys Gardner’s desire for freedom, to not be trapped in categories or other people’s agendas. To achieve that freedom requires stamina and endurance, which Gardner clearly possesses in these remarkable, enigmatic works.- John Yau",Alex Gardner: Psychic Stamina,"130 Orchard Street, NY 10002",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 1 Jun  - 26 Jul 2024  
Perrotin,Tokyo,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/robin-f-williams-undying/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Perrotin-Tokyo-new.jpg,Robin F. Williams,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/robin-f-williams/,"Undying extends Williams’s enduring engagement with the representation of women and the construction of gender in portraiture, advertising, folklore, social media, and film. Her vivid imagery is as diverse as her source material. Known for highly stylized figures composed through layers of brushwork, marbling, airbrushing, sponging, and stenciling, Williams often employs an arsenal of tools more familiar to crafting than to easel painting. These techniques anchor the lush opticality of her images in haptic relatability, humbling the gravitas of oil painting while creating richly textured surfaces that reward careful looking.Williams herself is a close observer. While creating Undying, she recalled looking for “the painting” in films, searching for shots where story and composition crystallized into an emotional punch. The resulting paintings, based on film stills, offer themselves up as a type of fan fiction that attenuates what is otherwise a fleeting erotic exchange. The Man Who Fell to Earth (2023), Persona (2023), Blue Velvet (2023), and Thirst (2023) offer a study in cinematic convention: all feature women on their backs under hulking partners, captured from the intrusive vantage point of an over-the-shoulder shot. Blacula (2023) and Videodrome (2023) study a slightly different trope, staging women who luxuriate under the influence of sinister forces beyond the frame. They may later meet their demise, but here, they are the only girl in the world.The ambiguity of gendered pleasure and its mediation on film formed the central topic of early feminist theory. Indeed, the heyday of b-movie slashers in the 1970s was accompanied by a wave of canonical texts including Laura Mulvey’s treatise on visual pleasure and narrative cinema. (1) The essay posited that film was a visual language developed by men for men, whose very structure preclude the possibility of female agency. Scholars since have insisted on greater complexity. Carol J. Clover’s concept of the “final girl” and Linda Williams theory of excessive emotion as cathartic cinematic experience offer models of identification for audiences of any gender to enjoy horror films as embodied subjects. (2) And yet the idea of enjoyment sits uneasily with horror. Our pleasure as viewers is often proportional to the misery that unfolds on screen. For example, the “final girl” is always tortured and miraculously survives, only to be condemned to return, again and again, in sequel after sequel, to face down the killer once more. What do we extract from these female protagonists? Film theorist Linda Williams suggests that extreme violence, sex, and emotion are hallmarks of the genre, whose excesses audiences consume like the vampires they watch on screen. (3) Taken together, the works in Undying deliver a closely cropped meditation on the dynamics of the vampiric in both filmic subject and spectator alike.As with vampires and their victims, in Williams’s paintings, opposites attract. The artist plays secondary and tertiary colors off one another to undergird the pictures with maximum tension. Vermillion and teal vibrate across the canvass in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Videodrome, and Thirst. Red and green clash in Persona. Grafting the laws of attraction onto the dogma of the color wheel, Williams plays at the edge of representation: complimentary colors provide maximum contrast when paired together but result in gray obliteration when fully combined. Photorealistic as they may appear, these paintings in fact hover at the edge of legibility. One brush stroke out of place, and the integrity of the whole would collapse.Williams locates the fine line between the erotic flirtation of colors versus the gray oblivion of their total imbrication; between the only girl and the “final girl”; and between the romance of an undying love versus the horror of the undead. Despite the ambiguity of the paintings, Williams wryly points out that their source films “are all tragedies, in the end.” The works in Undying walk the tightrope between self-determination and self-destruction, snaring both fictional subjects and real-time viewers in the frisson of a suspended moment where—as in good fan fiction—another ending is always possible.-Katherine Rochester, PhD(1) Laura Mulvey, “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,” Screen 16, no. 3 (Autumn 1975): 6–18.(2) Carol J.

Young girls bask in the tranquility of North American parks and gardens. Nature is idyllic, and nothing seems to disturb the peace of the languid protagonists. Singing, playing the piano, lying on beds or lush patches of grass, striking a pose on a shopping street, or holding a bouquet of white flowers, these girls inhabit a world of serenity, luxury, and pleasure.Yet we know that the “real” world is very different, marred by aggression, violence, tension, and war, leaving little room for relaxation and personal well-being. Beeman’s vision is a Platonic ideal, depicting the world not as it is but as it should be. Over time, she began to diminish the emphasis on individuality in her subjects, perceiving them as components of a singular entity. Currently, the only distinguishing features among these figures are their attire, scale—such as the smaller stature of the little girl compared to others—and occasionally, gender, particularly when depicting romantic relationships. She posits that the world encapsulated within her work might exclude individual experience portraying it instead as an idealized realm of flawless, seamless connectivity. In this envisioned space, the notion of internal conflict or tension within individuals seems incongruous.The history of art is full of recurring faces. Beeman’s work recalls the soft, elongated features and intense gaze of the woman who haunted Sandro Botticelli’s paintings. Like Petrarch’s Laure or Dante’s Beatrice, this enigmatic woman, who utterly captivated the painter, embodies the feminine ideal. Yet there are also echoes of Amedeo Modigliani’s angelic faces with their vacant, soul-searching eyes, as well as the pre-Raphaelite paintings of Rossetti and Burne-Jones.The exhibition is titled Distant Cities. Many works contain architectural elements that serve as reassuring and threatening settings for Beeman’s figures. The city is presented as a metaphor for a future that may not necessarily be bright and from which we try to escape despite the apparent calmness of the scenes. Our relationship with this future becomes more than ambivalent, at times frightening, at times exciting. A smaller figure symbolizes the movement back and forth in time. The artist says, ""She’s a younger version of the ’others.' Sometimes, they seem to protect her. Elsewhere, she appears to be running away, and they try to dissuade her... I often think about time, experience, and that strange feeling of discontinuity that we sometimes have in life, especially during experiences of trauma and loss. Some of the paintings in this exhibition are more memory than fiction, but the line is quite blurred"".Beeman’s work is defined by its clear lines, which are highly graphic and meticulously arranged. Everything in her universe is in its place; even the flight of birds in the sky seems to follow a precise, preordained path. However, one feels that even a minor disruption could create chaos in this well-oiled machine, creating a sense of both solidity and fragility.The paintings have the delicacy of painted silk and the smoothness of marble inlays. Yet they exude a certain coldness, keeping us at arm’s length. There’s something old-fashioned about them, as though they had been painted in a bygone era—as if a major catastrophe had reshuffled the cards, turning the works into signals from another world. As the artist aptly says, ""Sometimes they wish time would stand still.""",Kelly Beeman: Distant Cities,"2bis Avenue Matignon, 75008",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 24 May  - 29 Jun 2024  
Perrotin Los Angeles,Los Angeles,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/mschf-art-2/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",MSCHF,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/mschf/,"In 1939, the Del Mar Theatre burst onto California’s cinema scene with Frank Capra’s “You Can’t Take It with You.” Throughout the next eight decades, the space has transformed and changed hands. Most recently, Perrotin Los Angeles took possession of the building, converting it into an art gallery while preserving the theater’s historical marquee. An auditorium enhanced by Johnston Marklee serves as the central gallery space, where art collective MSCHF exhibits their second Perrotin solo presentation, Art 2. The collective stages a series of installations bound by the theme of a second act. In Tinseltown, where sequels seem inevitable, MSCHF takes on the role of superhero and villain. Drop after drop, they keep returning — taking us for a joyride. MSCHF shapeshifts between art collective and fashion company, traversing multiple dimensions while collectors, consumers, gamers and friends are subjects of their performative exercises.In 2021, MSCHF acquired Fairies, an Andy Warhol ink-on-paper drawing. They reproduced 999 identical copies, mixed them with the original, and sold each for $250 at Drop #59, Museum of Forgeries. In a matter of minutes, all 1,000 artworks sold out. If their website hadn’t fully disclosed their speculative proposition of erasing provenance from this unique work, MSCHF may well be in orange jumpsuits. 2024’s art world headlines trumpet the industry’s fixation on authenticity, from the ongoing saga of Leonardo Da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi to Rembrandt’s The Adoration of the Kings. Riding on this wave of absurdity in attribution and perceived value, MSCHF transfers its online project to a gallery context. Their sophomore iteration revolves around Pablo Picasso’s Le Poisson, a carved wooden artifact that fits in the palm of your hand. Replicated 249 times, this sculpture is recast as a school of fish adorning one long wall. The bait is twofold: a collector may purchase the entire installation, guaranteeing their “catch” of an original Picasso. Or 250 frenzied fans vote with their dollars to democratize accessibility over art pedigree.MSCHF’s Drop #84 Key4All demonstrates what can happen when thousands of people across the country can access a single car via duplicate keys. While the art collective originally predicted a Grand Theft Auto competition of participants stealing the 2004 Chrysler PT Cruiser from one another, the results revealed a dedicated, caring community. Participants constantly repaired, repainted, and accessorized the vehicular protagonist as it winded its way to Truckee, California, its final resting place where it broke down. A standout of this gallery exhibition, the Public Universal Car, now a relic, is accompanied by documentation and ephemera of its almost year-long transatlantic trek. Its static state recalls Ant Farm’s infamous public sculpture, Cadillac Ranch. This work explored alternatives to corporate architecture and featured ten junked Cadillacs half-buried in a Texas field. When the Cruiser is purchased, the proceeds will allow MSCHF to place a Key4All transceiver into a new vehicle, resurrecting the project to don its treads once more.If you’re on the internet, there was no escaping 2023’s ubiquitous Big Red Boot (BRB). The boot became an overnight sensation when the Astro Boy cartoon image was realized as a seamless construction of molded rubber. We were bombarded with pictures of celebrities stylishly rocking them, then influencers, and finally, the whole wide world. In a matter of weeks, the project’s approval rating went from brilliant to despicable. Internally, MSCHF grappled with the conundrum of popularity subsuming the art project’s intention: mastering craftsmanship through the platonic ideal of exaggerated footwear. In a humorous double entendre, Bootlegs (in a series of six) is the Big Red Boot fitted with partially hairy legs, a reincarnation of an iconic image hijacked by meme culture.Another instance of the transformative power of virality brings us to a small church in the Spanish village of Borja. A deteriorating painting once known as Ecco Homo resided here for many years when a beloved parishioner took it upon herself to improve the work in 2012. However, she lacked the touch of a skilled restorer, and the suffering countenance of Jesus Christ was subsequently rebaptized by the media as Monkey Christ, Potato Jesus or Beast Jesus. While the aesthetic results were disastrous, thousands of curious internet pilgrims descended, bringing a tourism boom to the town. This meme-fied conversion of destruction to creation inspired MSCHF’s series Botched Masters. The collective purchased a handful of 17th and 18th century religious paintings, then “restored” aspects of each work, hoping to emulate the indie magic of Borja. In “destroying” the work, does their hand bring new value to the revised creation? Still to be scripted.In the fast-moving world of fashion, there are three reigning accessory categories: shoes, bags, and frames. MSCHF’s portfolio includes the first two (and there are whispers of a future eyewear drop). For their third bag venture deconstructing the luxury product, the aptly named Microscopic Handbags are tiny and only viewable by microscope. Co-opting a biomedical industry technique, MSCHF leveraged 3D printing based on a two-photon polymerization for ultraprecise micro- fabrication in liquid resin. Each of the five works produced for this exhibition salute renowned bag makers: Bottega Veneta, Gucci, Hermes, Jacquemus, and Telfar. Probing lineage and legitimacy, these artworks are the 21st century portrayal of the ancient Indian fable featuring two weavers who deceive a king by presenting him with a garment that can only be seen by the competent. Hoodwinked, the emperor parades nude in his supposed magnificent robe, with his court concurring until a child blurts out, “The emperor has no clothes.” With Microscopic Handbags, MSCHF co-stars as both weaver and child, a testament to their subversive cosplay.MSCHF proves spectacle comes in all shapes and sizes, centering their exhibition with an exclamation point, Touch Me Sculpture One More Time. Conjuring Michaelangelo and Bernini, the bronze work is a group of friends in a chaotic embrace. The tangled bodies stand on a pentagonal pedestal, edged with an LED readout flashing a set of numbers. MSCHF would like the digits to remain a mystery until the art work is experienced in the gallery.Spoiler alert: you are likely to laugh out loud.

"Perrotin Marais, Paris",Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/klara-kristalova-4/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Klara Kristalova,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/klara-kristalova/,"“I am a sculpting draughtsman and painter”: Klara Kristalova, born in 1967, doesn’t let herself be pigeonholed into categories, and even takes pleasure in defying them. Far from any conventional approach, she allows unexpectedness and singularity to emerge from the abolition of boundaries between the arts, from the exploration of undefined margins. In the mid-1990s, her artistic path took her away from pure painting and towards modelling. She approaches this discipline with a great deal of freedom and playfulness, appreciating both its shaping and its materiality. Kristalova’s ceramics arise from successive transformations. A quick drawing is soon followed by modelling, which develops this initial intention. By kneading, she reconnects with an ancestral practice. The clay is worked directly with the fingers, creating irregularities and shifting surfaces. An initial firing precedes the moment of painting on ceramic, quick and playful... Finally comes the ultimate transformation: the final firing and its unpredictability. Kristalova’s creative process incorporates imperfection, emergence and a certain amount of chance: when the kiln is opened, she particularly likes it when the colours have dripped and blended. When they nestle in an unexpected space, blurring the contrast between the purity of the white and the intentionally cold, dark colours.In the midst of this ceramic population, a few vigorous bronzes temper the vulnerability of the clay.[Beast]Beast invites us to plunge into Kristalova’s enigmatic universe. Reality blends with fiction: human or animal heads and masks rub shoulders with hybrid beings, with unusual distortions of scale. What emerges is a fantastic world where anxiety borders on humour, as with the gigantic insect in The fly’s kiss, whose flower-like proboscis delicately touches the child’s lips. An unexpected moment of tenderness is born from this supernatural kiss.Kristalova blurs the boundaries between nature and humanity. Fascinated by the connection between humans, animals and plants, she combines them at will, like playful and disturbing exquisite corpses. Man as a natural being is omnipresent: he merges into an invasive, all- encompassing nature; the plants incorporate human faces. Are Kristalova’s beings humanoid animals, or are they animalised, vegetalised humans? Probably neither: the hybrid being occupies a space between, a limbo land. Far from the classifications in which humans like to confine the world in order to control it better.The indeterminate nature of these hybrid beings places them in a fantastical universe rooted in symbolism: in front of All my thoughts or the flower-faces, we are irresistibly reminded of Odilon Redon’s Smiling Spider. These beings become “phantasms,” in the etymological sense of apparitions. Are we in another reality or are we in the world of dreams, or even nightmares, a distant cousin of the visions of Munch or Goya? Kristalova’s creatures’ non-compliance with real beings gives them the status of “beasts.” As such, they embody an otherness, a uniqueness, a difference that raises questions: the beast externalises and transposes fears, frustrations, rage and panic into its very appearance, but also expresses a form of outlet, of freedom... A strange people not unlike Gauguin’s ceramic monsters.[Vacillations]Kristalova’s hybrid beings sound out the way we look at others, our society’s complex relationship with monstrosity and deviations from the norm. What room is there for difference when smooth, standardised beauty is valued above all else? The hybrid world challenges the definition of the human, and raises the question of the definition of the body, its limits and its integrity. The transformations undergone by these imaginary bodies are sometimes tinged with a muted violence. The tree branches and roots that sprout from the bodies are as much factors of power, bulwarks against human excess, as they are potential prisons: such is the case of the astonishing Log, a young girl trapped in a trunk that is reminiscent of the piece of wood cradled by the enigmatic “Log Lady” in David Lynch’s universe. When difference calls existence into question.The eruption of plant life into the bodies of young people also reflects the mutation of adolescent bodies, bearers of a vitalistic sap. Power and fragility, playfulness and seriousness, growth and invasion are all at work in these young beings steeped in questions, contradictions and doubts. Worry mingles with insouciance, grandeur with a fragility that can be seen in the attitude of the Mouse, with his hands in his pockets. Yet adolescence is the age of all possibilities, before gender determines how an individual is viewed, before the divorce between the sexes is irrevocably consummated. There is an omnipresent nostalgia for this suspended time.The liminality of physical appearance is also the liminality of an instant: the narrative seems interrupted, without a thread to hold on to. The viewer questions both the nature of the beings and the links between them: why does All my thoughts stand apart? Larger than life, a smiling young girl perched on never-ending stick-legs, seems to move slowly and benevolently amongst the others, like a carnival monster on stilts. A timeless moment in which social norms and conventions are turned on their head. Non-conformity, freedom, distance and entertainment are always active in Kristalova’s work: in the shade of the head-flowers, a Reclining bird lounges in high heels. In Ordinary day, rabbits taunt a disgruntled wolf from the top of a tree.There is no Manichaeism in this suspended world of possibilities. The tipping point is never certain, even when anxiety wells up: is the humanoid Mouse just shy, encircled by the beings around him, or is he threatening them? The young mouse-man reflects the complexity at work in all of us, whether or not we are inclined towards darkness. Simultaneously vulnerable and powerful, he reflects the threat that man poses to the earth. His invocation by the artist is invested with a cathartic value, in the Aristotelian sense of the term: a purifying of the passions. The work therefore has an almost magical, prophylactic value.Concerned about the rise of extremes and mankind’s destructive attitude, Kristalova constructs a world that reveals the fragility of life and the complexity of the relationships that are forged between beings. The viewer is invited to question his or her perception, which changes according to his or her psychology and state of mind. “My art is about language, communication,” says Kristalova. This imaginary dialogue, the keys to which are not revealed, allows each of us to project our own feelings and anxieties... A genuine relationship that engages the individual and integrates him or her into the space of the work: art as experience, to paraphrase John Dewey.Ophélie Ferlier-Bouat, director of Bourdelle museum, Paris",Klara Kristalova: Beast,"76 rue de Turenne, 75003",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 13 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024  
"Perrotin Marais, Paris",Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/julian-charriere-panchronic-gardens/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Julian Charriere,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/julian-charriere/,"Combining installation, sculpture, film, and photography, Charrière’s projects often involve fieldwork in liminal spaces, from industrial extraction sites to volcanic calderas, from remote ice fields to nuclear testing grounds.Fossil fuels are so named because they originate from rocks buried deep in the bowels of the earth, formed over hundreds of millions of years from the decomposition of organic debris. Once extracted, these raw materials can be easily stored, transported, and burnt, making them a highly efficient energy source. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Europe experienced the Industrial Revolution, which relied heavily on hydrocarbon fuels for economic growth. The widespread use of oil, natural gas, and coal facilitated the expansion of factories, machinery, and transportation. Today, we are witnessing the adverse effects of our hyperdependence on this energy triad: its resources are far from inexhaustible, its distribution is subject to geopolitical uncertainties, and its combustion releases pollutants into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the leading cause of global warming. Long ignored or neglected, the impact of greenhouse gases on the environment is now proving disastrous. Expanding deserts, melting icecaps, acidifying oceans, eroding biodiversity, megafires, and other climate disruptions: collapsologist fantasies, dystopian imaginaries, and eco-catastrophes à la J.G. Ballard have become a reality. As the author of The Atrocity Exhibition (1970) put it, today, we’re at the mercy of an “impending Pompeii.”Fire Walk with MeIn his video And Beneath It All Flows Liquid Fire (2019), Julian Charrière displays a burning fountain as a metaphor for this coming conflagration. Presented at the opening of his first solo show organized by Perrotin gallery, this emblematic work highlights the role that fire plays in his art. By transforming the fountain motif into a symbol of our vanities, the Franco-Swiss artist reminds us that Western society entered modernity through a baptism of fire. These fascinating blazes illustrate the concept of the Pyrocene, the age in which the combustion of fossil fuels and the fires caused by droughts are turning our planet into a furnace. The same aesthetic of oxymorons is evident in Buried Sunshines Burn (2023), a series that explores the consequences of fossil fuel extraction in California, using heliography to transform aerial views of oilfields into a subtle play of appearances. Heliography, which means “writing of the sun,” is a process invented by Niépce in the early 19th century, during the prehistory of photography. The materials’ golden and silvery viscosity gives a luminous quality to the images of soil contaminated with heavy metals found in oil. There is a psychedelic sparkle in the mirages and maledictions of this black gold. Beneath the flashy surface, we are consumed by demons.Millennia Watching UsJulian Charrière is an artist who ventures into the field to better understand what’s happening to our planet. He seeks out places with ambiguous geophysical identities in the four corners of the globe, where different histories and temporalities overlap: former mining sites, radioactive zones, permafrost in the Far North, palm oil plantations, volcanic regions, and deep-sea abysses. Going back in time and into the depths of the Earth, his artistic investigations probe the speculative and narrative resources of the subsoil. The volcanic rocks that make up the series A Stone Dream of You (2023) have been combined with orbs of black obsidian, whose glassy appearance resembles staring eyes. Arranged on the gallery floor, the minerals collected in Mexico bear witness to millennia-old geothermal phenomena: movements of the earth’s mantle, seismic tremors, and magma eruptions. These chimerical beings stand in our way, staring at us from the depths of time. The reflective sculptures on the walls create further visual interplay. Coalface (2024) consists of large pieces of anthracite coal cut in half that function like distorting mirrors. Thus, the only human presence in the exhibition is the visitors’ furtive, ghostly, grotesque reflection. This optical device echoes the black mirror once used by painters. In keeping with its name, it reflected the world in black and white, isolating light intensities and enhancing contrasts. In addition to its technical properties, the black mirror has had spiritual and esoteric connotations from ancient Mesoamerican culture into the physiological research in the 18th and 19th centuries, and beyond. In the words of artist Odilon Redon, the dark yet brilliant material puts “the logic of the visible at the service of the invisible” – as if to reveal the dark side of our reflection.The Vertigo of InfinityLike the “nonsites” pioneered by Robert Smithson in the late 1960s, Julian Charrière collects soil fragments to conduct geological surveys of the material traces of the planet’s exploitation. “I’m very interested in the chemical cycles of materials, specifically the carbon cycle, which has been greatly affected by the burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution.” Inserted into a large metal grid, an imposing block of coal forms a surreal sculpture with a specially designed cavity where viewers can bury their heads. Soothsayer (2021) offers a strange sensory experience connecting us to another space-time reality. Combining scientific curiosity with a passion for the fantastic, Charrière depicts human time within the vastness of geological time. Encapsulating multiple temporalities, the programmatic, spectacular, immersive Panchronic Garden (2022) gives the exhibition its title. The word “panchronic” refers to an animal or plant organism that bears a strong morphological resemblance to an extinct species. They are also known as relict species. Panchronic Garden brings to life a garden of the third kind, where ancestral ferns reconstitute a biotope from the Carboniferous – the geological era when coal was formed. Over 300 million years ago, our current fossil fuel reserves were lush forests. With its infinitely mirrored carbon fiber floor and walls, infrared light, and sonic maelstrom, Charrière’s terrarium embraces the artificiality of our conception of nature. Sensors linked to computer systems generate soundscape that offer a glimpse into the sophisticated sensory environment of plants. The high-tech devices reveal how such living organisms perceive the stimuli of their ecosystem, a supernatural mode of communication that frees these heroes of planetary preservation from their customary silence. In the various spaces of Panchronic Gardens, time is suspended, producing a vertigo of infinity in the face of the incommensurable. Thus, for Julian Charrière, “art becomes a tool for exploring large abstractions.”An Ecological Memento MoriIn the age of the Anthropocene, where survival depends on redefining how we live in the world, Julian Charrière’s art portrays our understanding and perception of environmental issues. His work, however, goes beyond the confines of so-called ecological art and stands out for its ability to bridge the gap between conceptual approach and sensory experience, science and fiction, archaic processes and futuristic forms. The ecological crisis we are facing is primarily a crisis of sensibility. Therefore, art can play a decisive role in enriching and transforming our relationship with nature and the living. We need artworks that add emotion, symbolism, knowledge, and imagination to our perception of the world in all its irreducibility and complexity. More than an exhibition, Panchronic Gardens is an artistic and cosmic expedition.Stéphane Malfettes, director of the Subsistances, Lyon",Julian Charrière: Panchronic Gardens,"76 rue de Turenne, 75003",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 13 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

It is an act of attempted immortality on a minor scale.”Hernan BasText by Anaël PigeatThe first and the last? But what is this absurd competition? What is this divine realm where these roles are reversed? The darkly humorous subject of Hernan Bas’s exhibition The First and the Last was inspired by the Olympic Games that will take place in Paris this summer. Following his exhibition The Conceptualists at the Bass Museum in Miami, Bas wanted to take a more light-hearted approach and pay tribute to the magnificent losers he is so fond of.Bas begins his paintings or drawings by making lists of titles, which he then converts into images using photographic montages. These images are then projected onto the canvas, to which he applies acrylic paint. In his new exhibition, he presents his drawings as stand-alone artworks for the first time. He has adopted Paul Gauguin’s transfer technique, a delicate practice that consists of coating sheets of paper with ink, turning them over, and drawing on the back to leave the imprint of the strokes on the substrate – a single, too-forceful gesture can instantly ruin the whole thing. He adds up to ten layers of grey using silkscreens. Although he generally employs acrylic in his paintings, he has also experimented with oil highlights on silver strips or fragments of uniforms.Bass’s latest series is populated by a whole host of eclectic characters. Imagine the winner of one of those weekly dance contests during the Great Depression, the contestants pushing themselves to the brink of exhaustion. One character dons a T-shirt that reads, “They shoot horses, don’t they?” In an old-fashioned café, a drinker takes a melancholic sip of absinthe. And could this goldfish really be the first animal on Mars? A young man pruning branches in a bucolic forest seems busy with esoteric projects in an atmosphere reminiscent of the Blair Witch Project. Hernan Bas has been working to complete several pieces, such as his work on paper Finding the First Flock of Flamingos to Return to Florida in a Century, inspired by the recent return of pink flamingos to Florida, where Hernan Bas resides. These birds were hunted to extinction before being reintroduced from Cuba, where Bas’s family is originally from.Hernan Bas combines the idea of vain competition with the desire – perhaps no less vain – of making a mark in history. He shows us ghostly traces on the ceiling of The Eagle pub in Cambridge, created by airmen during the Second World War using wax candles, lighters, and lipstick. In another drawing, a pupil seated at a school desk engraves words into wood in front of mathematical equations on a blackboard, like so many poetic riddles: “The end doesn’t even matter,” “his own name,” “I want pizza.” And in yet another drawing, a figure has carved letters into the leaves of a succulent plant, curiously entitled the tourist tree.Hernan Bas’s exhibition carries a profound sense of the end of the world, often intertwined with elements of humor. In The Last Day that Tower Was Standing, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is seemingly saved from collapse by a tourist’s hand, akin to a holiday snapshot. A man indulges in a final, extravagant meal before an asteroid’s imminent arrival. Ailing in a hospital bed, a man prepares to utter his last words or perhaps to receive them in the form of a postcard... The presence of Picasso’s Guernica in the background of the large painting The Last Museum Guard at the Last Museum on Earth is too somber to elicit a smile. Hernan Bas doesn’t depict the accident; he hints at the impending catastrophe through ambiguous interludes.Anaël Pigeat, art critic",Hernan Bas: The First and the Last,"76 rue de Turenne, 75003",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 13 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024  
Perrotin Seoul,Seoul,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/gregor-hildebrandt-kraniche-ziehen-voruber-cranes-passing-by/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Gregor Hildebrandt,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/gregor-hildebrandt/,"Every morning, the artist is greeted by cranes flying overhead in the ceiling painting of his Berlin bedroom. Cranes never linger, they stay on the move; their flight determined by their constant migration from summer to winter habitats and back. The exhibition’s title refers to a 1957 film by Russian director Mikhail Kalatosov, The Cranes Are Flying, which begins in the early morning and shows an exuberant young couple in love dancing through the deserted streets of Moscow. They pause briefly to watch cranes migrating in the sky, at which point they are surprised by a street-cleaning vehicle and sprayed with water. But that doesn’t dampen the lovers’ spirits.Gregor Hildebrandt is a lover. He loves life, art, film and music, and he generously shares this love with the world through his art. It would be an understatement to say that music runs through his artistic oeuvre; indeed, the artist not only creates his work from sound carriers—tapes and records—but he also plays with all the registers of music in his art, with tempo, rhythm, emphasis, pauses, repetitions and cadences. And with melodies, remembered a million times over, but which never fully emerge as such in his work. He is also a supporter of musical talent and releases meticulously produced vinyl albums by selected artist-musicians on his own label.The essential difference between a painting and a piece of music is that the piece of music unfolds in time. It requires the audience to listen, to follow it closely in order to understand it. This takes a certain amount of time that cannot be regained, but offers an experience that cannot be undone. The work of art cannot be unseen either, but it presents itself in its entirety to the eyes of the viewer, the linearity of viewing is reserved for the gaze of the individual viewer, so each pictorial narrative unfolds individually.Free-standing columns of colorful painted vinyl records, shaped into bowls and stacked on top of each other, pay homage to the great classic of modern sculpture, Constantin Brancusi’s Endless Column. The records’ colors mimic the striped pattern of Gregor Hildebrandt’s partner’s mother’s sweater, thus taking up private, almost intimate motifs. At a time when it seems commonplace that music, in the form of digital files, has evaporated into the ubiquitous “cloud”, records, video and audio tapes are often seen as obsolete storage media. But in Hildebrandt’s artworks, it is precisely these media that enable the abstract pieces of music to acquire a body, to remain tangible; they represent a direct link to the musical work and the performers—as well as the legends and myths associated with them. As analog objects, they are direct impressions of events, of transmitted acoustic vibrations, which, precisely because they remain silent, open up a space for the viewer’s imagination, for subjective associations, thus forming a resonance space for a kind of inner listening.Gregor Hildebrandt’s process for creating his works actually produces two images, similar to analog photography: a positive and a negative. Sound or video tapes mounted on canvases are further processed by the artist using acrylic paint, often with gestural markings reminiscent of abstract expressionist artists. The tapes are then peeled off again and, depending on how the canvas has been prepared, the magnetic layer may or may not stick to the canvas. The removed tapes themselves form a kind of negative of the first picture and are mounted on a second canvas, forming the complementary counterpart to the first picture, both carrying the same music and signs, only inverted, like flickering mirror images or echoes of barely remembered dreams.The interplay between negative and positive is itself the subject of two new works, which consist of cassette tape racks—the paper inserted into the sleeves forming the motifs. Donna (2024) depicts the actress Natalie Portman wearing make-up for her role in Darren Aronofsky’s 2010 film Black Swan. It shows the path of an ambitious dancer in her self-destructive struggle to claim the antagonistic roles of the black and white swans in Piotr Tchaikovsky’s ballet Swan Lake, which dramatically escalates in hallucinatory episodes until the cadence, which deals with artistic perfection and self-destruction. In the ink jet print of the actress’s portrait there is a hole torn by the artist, like a large tear, through which the original titles on the cassette sleeves reveal themselves. There, the name of pop diva Madonna stands out, introducing another layer of pop-cultural references, an intensification and distillation of the portrayal of the obsessive artist.Umatmen erwünschte Lüfte dir die beruhigte Flut (2024, in awkward approximation by the author, and only for the purpose of this text: breathe in the desired air on the calm tide) is a nearly untranslatable line from the 1801 hymn dedicated to divinity in nature and the glories of ancient Greece, Der Archipelagus, by Friedrich Hölderlin. It was written in what is now Bad Homburg, Hildebrandt’s birthplace, and begins with the motif of returning cranes. Hildebrandt’s work bearing this title takes the subject of white and black swans and in turn depicts two swans facing each other, inspired by Swedish painter Hilma af Klint’s most famous painting: The Swan, Group IX/SUW, No. 1 (1915), showing a white swan on a black background and a black swan on a white background, their beaks and the tips of their wings touching. For Hilma af Klint, the swans symbolized the overcoming of a world that was deeply polarized along dualities such as good and evil, day and night, man and woman. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the artist experienced a creative phase lasting several years, during which she perceived her hand as being guided by a higher power while painting, thereby revealing an otherwise hidden perspective on the world of cosmic unification.Gregor Hildebrandt’s version turns the motif from Klint’s painting on its head, her white swan is black in his painting and vice versa, but the fundamental change hardly alters the overall impression and thus emphasizes Klint’s point. A significant difference in motif, however, lies in the fact that the artist poetically concretizes the cosmic union. The swans were not placed over the existing inlays of the cassettes, as in the case of Donna, but were cut out directly from black and white inlays. The information on the backs of the cassettes thus remains partially visible,—in what at first glance seems like an arbitrary arrangement of titles and artist, resulting in a kind of meta-poem, full of emotional confusion, dream images and chimeras, memories and fantasies. Where the beaks of the two swans meet, on the back of a cassette, there is only a single word: lover.Andreas Schlaegel (writer, artist)",Gregor Hildebrandt: Kraniche Ziehen Vorüber (Cranes Passing By),"10 Dosan-daero 45-gil, Gangnam-gu,",Mon-Sat 10am-6pm, 14 May  - 29 Jun 2024  
Perrotin Shanghai,Shanghai,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/marty-schnapf-thresholds/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SHANGHAI-PERROTIN-Photo-Ringo-Cheung.jpg,Marty Schnapf,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/marty-schnapf/,"During a recent residency at the Xenia Creative Retreat in the United Kingdom, Schnapf, who grew up in rural Indiana but now lives and works in Los Angeles, began to consider how the places we inhabit survive in us long after we part and how, analogously, something of us remains in the places we leave. He began painting Forest Chimes, a pivotal piece that sets the tone for the exhibition. In this uncanny work, figuration and abstraction converge in undulating forms that evoke catharsis and wonder. We seem to have encountered a gatekeeper, the opening chorus to an exhibition that moves through wide-ranging vistas in a sweeping exploration of human perception and expression.If Forest Chimes is the entrance point, The First Moment of Sleep is quite literally the plunge. The threshold is crossed as a figure dives into water sending fish scattering in all directions. Water, a recurring motif in Schnapf’s oeuvre, is depicted as reflective, versatile in form, and metaphorical of the subconscious mind. The title of the piece also implies a certain freedom or release.Schnapf spent several years developing performance-based installations and events, and his investigations in these mediums, particularly dance, continue to inform his work today. Importantly, Schnapf regards his paintings as time-based works. Cognizant of the audience’s role in the activation of meaning, he builds multi-layered works that unfold slowly, rewarding prolonged viewing with ever-changing revelations. In this way, Schnapf’s paintings distinguish themselves from painted images. The Thresholds are not merely illustrated ideas. They are experienced passages discovered and crossed in the process of each work’s creation. Herein lies one of the secrets to the exhibition’s distinctly mercurial quality.Schnapf’s ongoing interest in the psychological resonance of abstract space is evident in his attention to compositional weight. In Sauna, for example, he harnesses the triangular arrangement of subjects to impart a sense of stability, while the downward motion of the embracing figures evokes feelings of vulnerability, protection, and warmth. The use of triangular compositions has art historical roots across cultures and can be seen as denoting spiritual hierarchy, solidity, and balance.Schnapf’s close relationship with dance and his extensive experience working with choreographers and DJs are evident in his gift for imbuing simple gestures with powerful emotional depth. His works transcend the aesthetics of grace and composure, probing deeper into the intricacies of the human psyche. In The Funambulist a raised protective arm echoes like a repeated thought in an orchestration of subtle color variations. This is counterbalanced by a lowered, receptive arm. The tightrope walker radiates strength as both shieldman and warrior, crouching in readiness and already taking his first step from one precipice toward another.Such overlapping perceptions indicate a borderless self and a multidimensional understanding of the world found throughout the exhibition. In Traveler, a figure traverses several settings, seasons, and temporal planes. She strides, resolutely present but surrounded by a constellation of living memories and imagined futures. Half Remembered Dream portrays a woman at once sleeping, sitting, rising, and floating against a surreal backdrop. We are privy to both her dream and its imperfect recollection.With Captain of the Ship, the Thresholds cycle returns to its beginnings. This painting is unique among the works in its portrayal of a child, the ultimate daydreamer. He stands on a pool float, about to jump into the water while the world around him shifts between manifold frames and viewpoints— windows into the varied narratives that transcend traditional boundaries of time and space.Collectively, the works in Thresholds depict intense energetic gateways that must be surpassed in order for desired reactions, phenomena, or conditions to manifest. Whether it be between different places, periods, or emotional states, the paintings signify this turning point.About the artistMarty Schnapf earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Wittenburg University in 1999, specializing in Painting, Printmaking, and Sculpture. His artistic realm conjures a fluctuating space marked by sensuality and psychological depth, where dreams, desires, and memories intertwine. Figures often overlap or are depicted in various choreographed positions, encapsulated within structurally fragmented environments that both envelop and intersect them. Through the dissolution and dislocation of these elements, Schnapf captures the dual aspects of a moment: its direct representation and its imagined or potential state.",Marty Schnapf: Thresholds,"3/F, 27 Huqiu Road, Huangpu District, 200002",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 31 May  - 6 Jul 2024

Instead it is crucial for him to let his oeuvre speak for itself, to tell the viewers as little as possible about his art in advance - in this way the content can be inscribed into the works by those experiencing them through a performative gesture (or even be created in the first place). For example, our press release for the exhibition ''Bruno Jakob: My Paintings'' from 2006, had a gap between the title and the text, according to the artist's wishes.Again and Again and Again / Pump the Cyber Space shows new works on paper, painted with water, energy and brain waves as well as new paintings and a 24-hour performance. Since the late 1970s, Bruno Jakob has been exploring the idea of the invisible, the unfinished, the provisional, the precarious and the ephemeral - all aspects that are still part of his painting today. The use of unusual, even immaterial painting media or media that fade again after the brush has been applied, such as various types of water, steam, energy, brainwaves, love, pain, emotions and sound, are characteristic for the artist: colour and colour pigments, for example, are nowhere to be found in his ongoing series of self-proclaimed Invisible Paintings. This results in viewers looking at seemingly empty, naked, untreated or apparently unfinished painting surfaces.During his career, the artist has intensively explored the painting process and meta-painting, which examines and questions painting itself and the means of painting. His paintings confront us with their representational nature, their objecthood, the haptic of the paper and the canvas or even the wall itself and are both political and poetic. Daily movements, such as the everyday movement through landscapes and cityscapes, have recently gained importance in the creation of his works. The titles of the works play a central role and lend them a narrative level. Although Jakob paints figurative or abstract motifs with brushes, these are often transparent to the human eye - after the act of painting, which is often carried out as a performance - and therefore become invisible, blur or fade over time. At the centre of his work are the sensations of each individual and not a definite understanding of his works: hence the need for a blank, unwritten sheet of paper instead of an exhibition text.Bruno Jakob's works have been exhibited internationally since 1988, particularly in his chosen hometown of New York. Works by the artist have been shown in countless solo and group exhibitions (including performative works - often performed with the Swiss artist and musician Hans Witschi), including Museum Tinguely, Basel, Switzerland (2022/2015), Helvetia Foyer, Basel, Switzerland (2020), Deutsches Haus, New York (2019), Kunsthaus Zofingen, Switzerland (2017), Kunsthaus Baselland, Muttenz, Switzerland (2016), Kunsthaus Glarus, Switzerland (2015), Kunstmuseum Luzern, Switzerland (2012), Haus Konstruktiv, Zurich, Switzerland (2011) and MoMA New York (2010). In 2014, Bruno Jakob was awarded the Ricola Collection Prize, Laufen, Switzerland. In 2011, Bruno Jakob was invited to show two installations at the 54th Venice Biennale in the Arsenale and in the main pavilion (curated by Bice Curiger). Works by the artist can be found in the collection of the Aargauer Kunsthaus, Switzerland, the Ricola Collection, Switzerland, the collection of the Kunsthaus Lichtenstein or the Art Collection of the Swiss Confederation, to name a few.",Bruno Jakob: Again and Again and Again,"Rämistrasse 33, 8001","Wed-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 26 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

Every moment has only one possibility.” Interested in the immediacy of the medium, she dedicated a large part of her artistic practice to producing drawings. Known for her “body awareness painting,” Lassnig’s works on paper are intimately connected to her singular approach, translating interior bodily sensations to line and value on the page. Concerning the connection between both forms, Lassnig states, “Every drawing is a prevented oil painting, because I do not repeat a drawing in an oil painting, [my drawings] are autonomous.”Lassnig’s drawings become experimental fields for spontaneously placed lines and color fields, as in Blaue Figur auf Rot (Blue Figure on Red), 1956. These compositions take shape across a range of processes, using acrylic, watercolor, and goauche aspects to tint her pencil works on paper.By bringing to the paper what she felt, not what she saw, Lassnig’s explorations of the subjective pith within are radically observed, producing images that represent immediate sensory impressions. Parallel to her introspective analysis through self-portraiture, Lassnig also observed the outside world–works on view include abstract depictions of a garden fence from the early 1960s in Wie am Gartenzaun (Like Beside the Garden Fence) as well as a kinetic scene between predator and prey from 1996 in Le buse (The Buzzard).Now rightfully recognized as one of the most important artists of the 20th century, Maria Lassnig made her own body the focus of her art early on, long before body consciousness became a central theme of the international avant-garde. Drawings reveals Lassnig’s unflinching, acutely internal process, bringing the viewer closer to their senses.About Maria LassnigMaria Lassnig was born in 1919 in Carinthia, Austria and passed away in 2014 in Vienna. Underappreciated for most of her life, Lassnig is now rightfully recognized as one of the most important Post-War painters.From a young age, Lassnig began to explore the human figure through drawing. She studied painting at the Vienna Fine Arts Academy but found the art scene at that time to be too limiting. She moved to Paris in 1960 and then to New York in 1968, continually exploring how to represent the body as it feels to inhabit rather than how it appears from the outside – a concept which Lassnig named Körperbewusstseinsmalerei (“body awareness painting”). On returning to her native Austria in 1980, she became the country’s first female professor of painting. She also taught animation during her time at the Vienna University of Applied Arts.Her life’s work won her many accolades including the Grand Austrian State Prize in 1988 and the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement in 2013 at the 55th Venice Biennale. She has been the subject of one person exhibitions at the Albertina Museum, Vienna; Deichtorhallen Hamburg; Kunsthaus Zurich; MoMA PS1, Long Island City, New York; Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Serpentine Gallery, London; Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam; and Vienna Secession among others. Lassnig represented Austria in the 1980 Venice Biennale alongside Valie Export, and she participated in Documenta in Kassel, Germany in 1982 and 1997.",Maria Lassnig: Drawings,"35 E 67th Street, NY 10065",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 15 May  - 22 Jun 2024  
"Petzel, 520 W 25th St",New York Chelsea,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/stefanie-heinze-mortar-the-cute-ones-shouldnt-go-unnoticed/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Stefanie Heinze,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/stefanie-heinze/,"Heinze considers mortar as a site of genesis, the container of beginnings, from which raw materials are processed. Mortar can be the sound of aggression, bombardment, a foil or a threat. Mortar and pestle, a receptable for grinding ingredients, a cup for holding and crushing hard, like the grinding of teeth, or the moment infatuation becomes obsession, when yearning turns from tender to brutal. The paste which binds building blocks together, holding and distributing weight, sometimes decorative, composed of cement, water and sand. Paint is mortar, the built environment is mortar, the grind is mortar, decisions are sealed in mortar, and so is the longing for something even better and bigger and harder.Heinze starts with small-scale drawings and collages, which are translated to large-scale tracings, undergoing several transformations as her canvases take shape. Rendering her surfaces over several months, layers of line and color are suspended in scenes at once frozen and in motion. Heinze works with a sense of suspicion, disputing the power of images. Her depictions are at times plush, like her floating, -bodied cherubs, or sharp and dense, like her reckless, airborne cinder blocks. Heinze’s pictures lend expanded, fragmented associations to her subjects, both stony and swaddled, heavy and buoyant. Heinze’s works negotiate categorization, neither pure figuration nor abstraction. Language hits a limit here, reaching for the means to describe–an enzyme, a digestif–where words fail. Heinze strives for a more empirical vocabulary, generating fields of sensation.Interested in divination practices, ranging from tarot reading to online “spiritualist” influencing, the artist creates images motivated by imagined futures, drawing on both medieval and New Age “Youtubian” utopias. Influenced by the theory of the third hand in painting, the experience of transcendence which overtakes the artist at that critical point of flow state absorption, Heinze’s leans into this tradition of mysticism. Heinze allows the pieces to reveal themselves over time, creating kinetic, shifting pictures that trip expectation. Heinze builds tender worlds, in which instinct and environment coalesce in new impossibilities.About Stefanie HeinzeStefanie Heinze’s (b. 1987, Berlin, Germany) paintings display ambiguous forms that become recognizable as unexpected subjects. From disembodied body parts, to everyday objects, to animal-like figures, her subjects melt into fantastical backgrounds to create vivid visual worlds, which reveal an interplay between high and low culture.Heinze’s brightly colored, imaginative compositions are tenderly subversive in their details and symbolism, complemented with equally lyrical titles. Pencil, ink, or ballpoint pen drawings – sometimes torn and collaged into multi-layered compositions – form a basis for Stefanie Heinze’s artistic practice, mapping for the opulent language of her paintings. Testing the fine line between abstraction and figuration, Heinze is categorically unique, as she explores new senses and possibilities of representation.In the short time since studying at Academy of Fine Arts, Oslo (2012) and graduating from the Academy of Fine Arts in Leipzig (2016), Heinze has exhibited widely. She has had solo exhibitions at Capitain Petzel, Berlin (2022); Petzel, New York (2020); Capitain Petzel, Berlin (2019); LC Queisser, Tbilisi (2019); among others. She has participated in numerous group shows including at Le Consortium, Dijon, (2023); The Hepworth Wakefield, West Yorkshire (2022-23); Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami (2022); Boros Foundation at Berghain, Berlin (2020) Deichtorhallen, Hamburg (2020); Sammlung Philara, Düsseldorf (2019); Saatchi Gallery, London (2018); and Tanya Leighton, Berlin (2017).Heinze has a forthcoming exhibition at the Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in 2024 that will be accompanied by an extensive exhibition catalogue.Heinze’s works are in the collections of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Musée d‘Art Moderne de Paris; MAMCO, Geneva; Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden; Pérez Art Museum, Miami; The Hepworth Wakefield, UK; Marguerite Hoffman Collection, Dallas; The Rachofsky Collection, Dallas; Mead Gallery at Warwick Arts Centre, UK; the Delfina Collection, UK; and the Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in Turin.",Stefanie Heinze: MORTAR (the cute ones shouldn’t go unnoticed),"520 W 25th Street, NY 10001",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 3 May  - 8 Jun 2024  
"Petzel, 520 W 25th St",New York Chelsea,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/nikita-gale-nosebleed/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Nikita Gale,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/nikita-gale/,"In NOSEBLEED, the artist reconsiders this most high and far seating section, situating the viewer in an elevated, aerial perspective, from which the spectator can observe both the field of play and the crowd of neighboring onlookers. The so-called “worst seat in the house,” the artist challenges the equation of nosebleed-tier distance with disadvantage, creating a space at once above and among the action.Encountering the installation, the viewer is confronted by the nosebleed vantage point of a stadium beneath their feet, the panoramic image blanketing the gallery floor. Reproduced on vinyl, figures with arms raised foreground a blurred sea of bodies, cresting fields of light and shadow. Mounted at an angle, a mirrored surface reflects the warped image onto the audience. The spectator floats above, stepping about and around various photographic works and sculptures, while a single spotlight illuminates the space. Gale encloses the audience in a distorted arena, in which the structural and atmospheric aspects of the stadium are superimposed under, above, and back onto the observer.Gale’s walls are left completely bare, redirecting the viewer’s gaze downward. Arranged atop the vinyl floor, the artist presents four deconstructed architectural models of stadiums. Using composite 3-d printed models, broken apart by hand and reconfigured in different orientations, the sculptures draw on both existing and unrealized projects. Two failed architectural plans, the Deutsches Stadion designed by Albert Speer and the Theatre of the Masses designed by Gaetano Ciocca, are cited. Real elements are composed from Madison Square Garden and Manchester Arena, both in-operation large-scale entertainment complexes.In addition to the models, Gale presents various mixed media and photographic works placed atop the vinyl floor. The artist debuts a new series of velvet on aluminum works, evocative of stage curtains, positing the space in a lexicon of theater. A new series of photographic images are similarly arranged on the ground. Comprised of both camera-less and camera-produced images, Gale’s subjects vary: an ear, an open mouth, a packed stadium, an empty grave, a copper mine, a tunnel from a Carrara marble quarry. Bearing roads, folds, seats, and teeth, Gale’s images spiral, sink into the floor. The viewer might find a mouth open to sing, or scream, at a concert. The copper mine might resemble a stadium, where the labor of performers is likewise extracted. The audience might look down at a body in a stadium, but also from the edge of a grave.Through NOSEBLEED, Gale presents an uneasy social arena, refracting the spectacle of performance and visibility onto the audience. Privileging the nosebleed perspective, wrought with culturally stratified ways of seeing and being seen, the artist considers the stadium as both a site of heightened connection and amplified vulnerability. How are anxieties and desires expressed through collective ritual, among others in crowded amphitheaters, among ourselves in our own bodies?About Nikita GaleNikita Gale (b. 1983 Anchorage, Alaska) is an artist living and working in Los Angeles, California and holds a BA in Anthropology with an emphasis in Archaeological Studies from Yale University and earned an MFA in New Genres at UCLA.Gale’s work explores the relationship between materials, power, and attention. A key tenet of the artist’s practice is that the structures that shape attention determine who or what is seen, heard, recorded, remembered, and believed.Gale’s practice examines the ways in which silence, noise, and visibility function as political positions and conditions. Gale’s broad-ranging installations – often comprising concrete, barricades, video and automated sound and lighting – blur formal and disciplinary boundaries, engaging with concerns of mediation and automation in contemporary performance. By approaching reproduction as a mechanism that connects humans to a desire for extension and amplification through both biological and industrial processes, the artist’s work points to the ways that technology not only functions as an extension and amplification of the body but also as a means by which labor and violence are displaced and concentrated.The artist’s work has recently been exhibited at Tate Modern (London), Chisenhale (London); LAXART (Los Angeles); 52 Walker (New York); MoMA PS1 (New York); Kunstraum Kreuzberg (Berlin); Swiss Institute (New York); California African American Museum (Los Angeles); The Studio Museum in Harlem (New York); and in “Whitney Biennial 2024: Even Better Than the Real Thing” at the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York) and “Made in L.A. 2018” at the Hammer Museum (Los Angeles).The artist’s work is included in the collections at the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, California; Hessel Museum of Art, Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts; Pérez Art Museum, Museum Miami (PAMM), Miami, Florida; The Studio Museum, Harlem, New York; and Tate Modern, London, United Kingdom.",Nikita Gale: NOSEBLEED,"520 W 25th Street, NY 10001",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 2 May  - 8 Jun 2024

Working on shaped stretchers, Jorden pulls, stretches, and incises linen to wrap around convex and concave curves. Jorden often refers to landscape and qualities of light in her work, associating the exposed areas of linen with the color and texture of the sandy soil of Southern California, where she resides.  ""My paintings are improvisations, exploring qualities of reflection, energy, movement, magnetism, and light.” Jorden comments. In a recent essay, she writes that each painting begins with a proposition, what she describes as ""an impetus to begin or enter.” Propositions are basic building blocks in Jorden's work, similar to those in logic or calculus. A proposition could be a color relation, an applied mark on bare linen, the shape of a given canvas, or the relation between two separate canvases in a multiple-canvas work.  ""Another recent inspiration, especially while making this body of work is the improvisational compositions of musicians and sound artists. I’ve recently been listening to interviews with contemporary composers.

Mobilising his own subject position - a white Western male - he becomes the embodiment of this troubling industry. Wearing sculptures made from secondhand clothes sourced in West Africa, he becomes a spectre of waste colonialism. In these monstrous incarnations, his flesh remains visible: a white hand, leg or foot. In simple terms, he performs his own whiteness.For this new development in the work, the artist will divide the gallery in two:The main space will feature an installation of effigies. This consists of dozens of figurines assembled from secondhand textiles; each one a miniature icon of the Dead White Man. Presented in a kind of wrongheaded museological display, these objects reference the ritual use of anthropomorphic totems, whose curative function operates through performance. Fashioned from clothes primarily sourced in the street markets of West Africa, this installation resurrects that material - returning it to the consumer delirium of London’s West End.This ethic of resurrection continues throughout the exhibition. In the second room of the gallery, a projected video sees the Dead White Man reverse the secondhand supply chain. Rising from a Senegalese street market, he wanders the city of Dakar until he arrives at the international port. Shipped back to the United Kingdom, he then haunts the shopping malls, textile recycling plants and corporate HQs of fast fashion brands. In the process, Hutchison performs his own entanglement with the network of processes that sustain the secondhand clothing industry. In doing so, he contests its claims to charity and sustainability, presenting it instead as a form of zombie imperialism.ContextDead White Man has been in development since 2017. It began with Hutchison’s invitation to attend an artist residency at Raw Material Company - a contemporary art platform in Dakar, Senegal. Throughout the subsequent years, he returned to Dakar to produce video and photographic work, while developing an extensive collaboration with The Or Foundation, a Ghanaian activist group based in Kantamanto (the largest secondhand market in the world).Exhibitions & MediaThe first chapter of this work was exhibited towards the end of 2023 at the British Textile Biennial. This included sculpture, performance, video, installation, billboards and workshops. The work has received global media attention, featuring in The Guardian, Dazed, The Times, The Daily Telegraph, KingKong, Creative Review, Vogue Business, among others.Jeremy Hutchison (b.1979) is a British artist based in London. Working across performance, sculpture, text and video he intervenes in systems of production and consumption, perverting norms to produce crisis and absurdity.

In various states of repose, her protagonists inhabit palatial spaces with self-possession and ease, in turn demanding that the viewer reckon with the direction of their own gaze. Do these figures pose for our gratification or their own? Are their brazen stares invitations or predatory?The exhibition takes ‘Villa Venus’, the chain of brothels described in Vladimir Nabokov’s novel, Ada or Ardor (1969), as its point of departure to explore the staging of fantasy and eroticism, and broader questions of autonomy, freedom, artifice and fetishism. In Nabokov’s novel, an architect builds a chain of decadent, temple-inspired brothels across the world, realising the fantasies drafted in his late grandson’s erotic journals. The architect’s ‘parodies of paradise’ soon crumble into nefarious dens of squalor and, like the garden mazes through which patrons would access Villa Venus, this staging of another’s Eden becomes a wasteland of weeds.In her paintings, Mitsola also acts as an architect of fantasy, constructing opulent temples reminiscent of seraglios, bath houses or boudoirs for her siren-like figures. Employing the spatial logic of set design from the 1960s, Mitsola’s environments share the flatness of the stage, where a whole world can be built upon the surface of things. Up close, the onlooker, becoming aware of the performance, must accept their complicity in the suspension of disbelief, upon which all modes of fantasy rely. In the small room at the back of the gallery, Mitsola extends this element of set-building, constructing a draped, temple-like setting to house a new animation. Softened by hanging chiffon, the painted columns and caryatids from her paintings extend into this space, inviting the viewer into the imagined architecture.A rose is present in several works on display; most evidently in Mitsola’s sculpture, her nod to a scene in Ada, where the young narrator visits a shop specialising in the reproduction of antiques and objets d’art. The narrator is perturbed by the unexpected sensation of a real flower hiding among a  bunch of imitation crimson roses. In this emporium of artifice and counterfeit, the outlier is the genuine object. In Mitsola’s paintings, the viewer is led through a similar hall of mirages and double images. Interrogating the concept of utopia and its inherent contradictions, the artist builds a seductive world that situates scenes of her protagonist’s liberation within constrictive frameworks.",Sofia Mitsola: Villa Venus: The Garden,"2 Savile Row, W1S 3PA","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 5 Jun  - 20 Jul 2024

Pippy Houldsworth Gallery,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/liorah-tchiprout-what-i-corrupted-was-what-is-called-the-truth/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",,,"In What I corrupted was what is called the truth… the artist stages her miniature paintings within an intimate yet uncanny studio setting, casting her dolls as actors in a scene that is equal parts personal diorama, cabinet of curiosities, and tableau vivant. A space complete with miniature versions of real objects found in her studio - cigarettes, Jane Austen novels, ersatz Tiffany lamp, prepared canvases, and a pot of brushes - the artist plays with shifting scales to create an intimate view of her studio practice.Presented in public for the first time, Tchiprout’s dolls are central to her practice, the basis of a self-referential realm from which the artist draws her subject matter. Building upon a wooden mannequin base, or covering her own metal wire armatures, Tchiprout’s figures are animated through modelling clay, human or animal hair, and handmade clothing. These dolls form the basis of her painterly compositions, groups of figures that bow their weighty heads, emotive in their slack physicality.As Tchiprout paints the dolls they mediate her experience of painting from life. Modelled after Tchiprout herself, or close family and friends, the dolls establish a visual shorthand for the artist, a set of motifs and expressions that are distillations or signifiers of real human figures, yet are also unreal in their upholstered lifelessness, abject in their departure from their subjects. In What I corrupted was what is called the truth…, the doll wearing black is modelled after the artist and made with cuttings of her own hair. Likewise, the artist symbiotically takes on the persona and appearance of her dolls. In this way, Tchiprout’s dolls and her subsequent paintings span opposite concepts of real and imaginary, living and inanimate, forming a closed circuit of self-referential observation and world-building.Having established her practice in printmaking, the artist’s transition to painting and sculpture also bears evidence of the mark-making of her earlier monoprints and etchings. Tchiprout considers how light arranges itself across the roughly hewn surface of the dolls’ faces, shadows falling into the concave impressions of her finger-marks in much the same way that tactile gesture informs her monoprints.Influenced by themes of longing and anticipation in the literature of of Yiddish women writers such as Rachel Korn and Miriam Karpilove, and drawing from the bold female protagonists in French American author Anaïs Nin’s novels, in this installation Tchiprout’s asks whether the spatial dynamics of replicating one’s studio and oneself on a miniature scale can metaphorically relate to the exterior and interior experience of womanhood, the secret multitudes contained within. The artist blurs what is real and what is idealistic within her mimetic presentation of herself and her practice. In presenting a hermetic loop of feedback between herself and her dolls, she questions where the truth may lie in a secure image of safety and interiority.Liorah Tchiprout (b. 1992, London) lives and works in London. She received her MA from Camberwell College of Art, London (2020), and earned her BA in Fine Art Printmaking at University of Brighton (2016).

Pontone,New York,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/actions-perceptions/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",,,"Letter from the curator, Max Lust:Are we doomed to be free? Sartre would say yes, we are stuck in the paradox of choices where even the choice not to choose is nevertheless a choice, proper. Despite the mistakes I have made in my private life-choosing to live my personal life in bad faith, which I paid for dearly-throughout my professional life I have made myriad choices as a collector and curator. These choices are presented before you. This exhibition tells my personal story in the form of a gesamtkunstwerk, or ""total work of art"", a pop-up art bar. In it are art objects represented by my friends and colleagues. It comprises a cross-over of various art markets and periods that, wittingly or not, I fell in love with, ranging from Antiquities to Modern and Contemporary art to art by young, emerging artists.This exhibition is deeply personal. After moving back to New York during the height of the pandemic, and following a dramatic rise and fall in Vienna's art scene, I rebuilt my career and new life in Manhattan. Although I was born the grandson of an important collector, this was not my choice. However, it became my choice to follow in his footsteps, the sole member of ten grandchildren and two sons to do so. It was, indeed, a choice to take up the mantle and honor my grandfather's legacy, mastering what Napoleon fortuitously called the ""[ability] to master luck""! In particular, I inherited my grandfather's vim to ﬁnd the most cutting-edge art. Although the 1990s more or less remained my grandfather's cut-oﬀ, I began expanding the timeline of the family collection when I started collecting Shepard Fairey prints at the age of 17. My fascination with Antiquities began during the pandemic, while still living in Vienna. I thus inaugurated the lengthy process of teaching myself how to read Egyptian hieroglyphics, a process I would continue after moving back to New York. I fell into the antiquities market purely by happenstance, during a stroll past a shop with what appeared to be an Egyptian relief in the window. My ﬁrst thought was that there was no way that this was real. But I was surprised when I peered at the label, which read ""Old Kingdom"". And there I was with a choice-to continue walking or go inside. I chose the latter and ended up making a new friend who was kind enough to consign many of the antiquities in this show.The fact that this show transpired is a rapprochement between blind luck and intentional choosing. For instance, Allan D'Arcangelo, whose work is displayed here, is an artist whom my grandfather ardently collected and one that I, too, deeply admire. In 2018, I returned to New York to attend auctions and art fairs during the ""high art"" season. My Austrian friends and I were at the Frieze preview, walking around the various booths. It was like being hit by a ton of bricks when we stumbled on a booth dedicated to D'Arcangelo's work. This was pure luck and I espied an opportunity. As a representative of the family collection, I introduced myself to the gentleman working the booth, who was none other than Martin Friedrichs. Martin had organized this D'Arcangelo exhibition. Six years later, he went independent and founded Friedrichs Pontone. We stayed in contact with one another throughout the years and, roughly four months ago, I was displaced from my flat following a major ﬁre in my building. Martin reached out to me regarding an unrelated matter when I then pitched the concept of the current exhibition to him. He agreed and here we are. This arc is thus represented by the Allan D'Arcangelo 1965 work-on-paper from my family collection.This exhibition is idiosyncratic, including well-known and young artists. It includes friends and those whom I never had an opportunity to meet. The nexus is a network built on luck, cold-calling, complimentary drinks and discussions occasioned by art openings. This is my third exhibition since moving back to New York and my fifth-ever in New York. This show is a cocktail of art. Roughly two-thirds are works from emerging artists, one-third from my family collection, and there is a splash of antiquities. Each week, a novel drink will be introduced to be paired with a rotating cast of artworks located behind the bar. The show celebrates spontaneity, changing weekly based on various events, some public and others private. Exhibited artists and works are subject to change without reason or warning. The pairings, however, expound genealogies of influence. Philip Hinge's devotional study of feline art is paired with the fragmented Egyptian bust of Baset, the Egyptian cat goddess. This thread illuminates feline devotion spanning over two thousand years. Fox Fagan, a promising 24-year-old artist, is paired with photographer Carlotta Corpron; both engage light and its diffusion. Corpron is a pioneer from the 1940s who experimented with motile camera movements and shutter speeds, creating architectural studies influenced by Moholy-Nagy. Fagan overexposes her film negatives to light, transferring the mylar image by way of tracing. And last but not least is the performance-cum-assemblage works of Young Boy Dancing Group (YBDG), which harken back to Viennese Actionism-in particular, Hermann Nitsch's photos of Rudolf Schwarzkogler's 1960s performances. The latter is represented by a photograph from my family's collection. One of the most piercing memories from my childhood, this photo frightened me quite a bit as a child. YBDG is also nostalgic. I became acquainted with some of their members in the Vienna art world. Following a wild few evenings at a popular drag party in Vienna, we reconnected in New York.Stop me if you've heard this one before… a man walks into a bar and orders a shot. He throws it back and looks at a photo nested in his wallet. He orders another shot and, after imbibing it, again peers at the photo. After repeating this action several times, the befuddled bartender asks, ""What is the photograph of?"" The man replies, ""It's a photo of my wife. When she starts to look good, I know to go home."" Sometimes it feels like this is the reason that art openings serve alcohol. When inebriated, even the most amateurish art might uncloak its dilettante embellishments, revealing something of genuine interest. But this is not the reason to imbibe here. The drinks, like the works, are cultivated with great intentionality. If you like the show, have a drink. If you don't like the show, have a drink. If you don't drink alcohol, just have a soda. After all, you are free to do as you please.To drink or not to drink, to like or dislike the exhibition, are personal choices. But with a gesamtkunstwerk, the percipient's experience-that very moment you view and engage the art object-itself arguably becomes a moment of art, briefly imbricated in the full latticework of art objects. Like the contemporary art in the exhibition, the antiquities on view were at one point contemporary. The earliest work of art in the collection, an Egyptian ceramic from the Gerzean (Naqada II, 3500-3200 BCE) Protodynastic Period, was once new. The piece was made well over 5000 years ago, but how we continue interacting with it today becomes a part of its story. If mankind is still around in 7024 AD, these ""contemporary"" works will also be 5000 years old, indexing an ancient epoch. Is that relevant? Well, that is up to you. But here you are, presented with the choice to enjoy the art, the drinks, and live in the moment, figuring in the fold of this epoch.Featuring works by:David BufordConner ChaseMaia del EstalFox FaganAngel LovecraftLuke Libera MooreSarah MuirheadJoseph ParraBill RabinovitchPasha SmelyantsevYoung Boy Dancing Group",Actions & Perceptions,"273 Church Street, NY 10013",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 3 May  - 8 Jun 2024

Her work is rooted in a formal exploration of light, colour and space, initiated by her memories and experiences of significant landscapes and their emotional associations. The artist’s original encounter with place and atmosphere is translated into a modified visual code for us to decipher. She uses a sumptuous range of vibrant, almost psychedelic colour to accentuate a feeling of heightened perception. Her contribution to the exhibition consists of paintings inspired by such sublime geography and a ‘spatial intervention’ in the form of a wall painting.Tõnis Saadoja deploys a controlled, programmatic method. He documents his response to personal source material in two discrete sets of paintings: small pictures of skies and larger ones of architecture. He deploys a different technique for each. The skies are rendered with a full-colour palette in a naturalistic mode of representation, while the architectural subjects are graphically described in a minimal range of muted hues which emphasises flatness and a sense of cool detachment. The subtlety and nuance of his picture-making evokes a romantic atmosphere, an echo of lost summer skies.Each artist displays a strong attachment to a sense of place, articulated through sophisticated manipulations typical of their respective practises. Kongi makes a directly expressive response, mediated by compositional devices. Saadoja essays thoughtful enquiries into the controlled presentation of content.

Eversley’s presentation represents not only his first public sculpture in New York, but also the first outdoor placement of the artist’s large-scale polyurethane resin works.“Fred Eversley’s art immerses us in perceptual experiences that bring us outside of ourselves. He explores how an artwork may inhabit the world around it while simultaneously inviting us into the realms of imagination and mystery,” said Public Art Fund Artistic & Executive Director Nicholas Baume. “Parabolic Light, Eversley’s first public work in his home city, takes his series of pristine cylindrical sculptures to a new scale and context, engaging with the ever-changing outdoor environment, the effects of natural light, and the countless visitors whose attention it captures.”New York-based artist Fred Eversley is a pioneer of the West Coast Light and Space and Finish Fetish movements. With his scientific background as an electrical and aerospace engineer informing his artistic practice for over fifty years, Eversley is renowned for his vivid cast resin works that invite audience-artwork interaction through a range of sensory phenomena. Dedicated to expressing ideas about energy as a physical and metaphysical concern for all of humanity, Eversley’s sculptures center on the parabola, the only shape that concentrates all forms of energy—light, sound, and heat—into a single acoustic and optical focal point.“My parabolic forms are all about energy. They are made to reflect all the infinite combinations of internal reflections, refractions, color changes, and other optical phenomena that one can experience within a single sculpture,” said artist Fred Eversley. “Parabolic Light and its display in Doris C. Freedman Plaza resonates with my vision of an energetic outdoor focal point to attract public audiences to spontaneously pause, slow down, and engage in numerous ways with a cosmic, mystifying object.”Eversley’s presentation with Public Art Fund marks an ambitious continuation of his new Cylindrical Lens works, the artist’s first series of larger-than-human-scale, free-standing, floor-based sculptures. These recent works—which debuted at David Kordansky Gallery in May 2023—are conceptually linked to the cylindrical section sculptures the artist first exhibited in his first solo presentation at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1970. The largest work of the series thus far, Parabolic Light, is shaped as a plano-convex lens that focuses light into a single line. It acts as an optical instrument where stillness and motion appear to be present at the same time. Its geometrical mass gradually transitions its magenta hue, from rich saturation at its bottom to colorless transparency at the apex. The color saturation further shifts depending on the angle of the viewer and the direction of the sun. The sculpture obtains its luminous tone and reflective quality from its crystal-clear resin material and through a labor-intensive hand-polishing process. Parabolic Light appears simultaneously reflective and transparent, liquid and solid—a manmade form with an otherworldly, ethereal quality.Parabolic Light prompts questions about how optical and physical perceptions determine how we connect with each other and the world, communicating a kinetic, palpable sense of the mysterious presence of energy throughout the universe. The sculpture’s properties, and direct placement on the ground, entice viewers to approach and move around the work. Bending, distorting, and reflecting faces, forms, and colors, the work heightens the relationship between the viewer’s body and the cylindrical lens. This key performative facet is on full display in this outdoor work. Interacting with natural light and spontaneous passers-by, it represents Eversley’s most far-reaching and dynamic foray into the cultivation of audience-artwork interaction to date. The work's outdoor site allows for natural light to hit its surface and further generate a range of refractions and prismatic effects, connecting the viewer’s senses with the object and the environment in spellbinding ways. In this way, the sculpture expands and destabilizes multiple states of existence and perception. Straddling the scientific, metaphysical, and mystical, the sculpture functions as a portal for viewers to a world of radiant color, abstracted form, and a re-examination of one’s self and others within our surroundings.Fred Eversley: Parabolic Light is curated by Public Art Fund Artistic & Executive Director Nicholas Baume with support from Public Art Fund Assistant Curator Jenée-Daria Strand, and developed by former Public Art Fund Senior Curator Allison Glenn.ABOUT THE ARTISTFred Eversley (b. 1941, Brooklyn, New York) is a key figure in the development of contemporary art from Los Angeles during the postwar period. He synthesizes elements from several art historical movements associated with Southern California, including Light and Space, though his work is the product of a pioneering vision all his own, informed by lifelong studies on the timeless principles of light, space, time, and gravity. Prior to becoming an artist, Eversley moved to California to become an engineer, collaborating with NASA and major aerospace companies to develop high-energy acoustic and vibration testing laboratories. Eversley’s work on NASA’s second and third human spaceflight programs, Gemini and Apollo, developed his interest in the parabola, which began when he was a teen. His pioneering use of plastic, polyester resin, and industrial dyes and pigments reflects the technological advances that define the postwar period even as his work reveals the timeless inner workings of the human eye and mind.Eversley will unveil his largest Public Commission to date, a sculptural installation, titled “Portals”, for permanent display in Able’s Park, at One Flagler, West Palm Beach in early summer of 2024, commissioned by Related Companies in partnership with the City of West Palm Beach. He has also been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Orange County Museum of Art, Costa Mesa, California (2022–2023); Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts (2017); Art + Practice, Los Angeles (2016); National Academy of Science, Washington, D.C. (1981); Palm Springs Art Museum, California (1977); Newport Harbor Art Museum, Newport Beach, California (1976); and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1970). Eversley will be part of two major group shows as part of the Pacific Standard Time Art and Science Collide program 2024. Recent group exhibitions include Light and Space, Copenhagen Contemporary, Copenhagen (2021–2022); Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power 1963–1983 (2017–2020, traveled to five venues); Space Shifters, Hayward Gallery, London (2018); Dynamo – A Century of Light and Motion in Art, Grand Palais, Paris (2013); Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945–1980 (Getty Foundation, 2011; traveled to Gropius Bau, Berlin, 2012). His work is in the permanent collections of more than three dozen museums throughout the world, including Tate Modern, London; Guggenheim Museum, New York; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas; Museum of Modern Art, New York; K11 Art Foundation, Hong Kong; and Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

She made the four bronze sculptures featured in Before The End by casting carved cork and skull fragments. The mysterious figures recall ancient effigies cut into tombstones.These expressive eight-foot-tall forms, titled Feel the Hammer, Member, Mr. Stone, and Nothing Falls, appear to be emerging from the depths of the earth, or perhaps returning to the underworld, their surfaces evoking centuries of eroded sediment and stone. The exhibition’s title, Before The End, creates a sense of momentous intensity, theatricality, and subtle humor. Like the sculptures themselves, Bhabha’s influences span across time and genre, including classic cult horror films like Destroy All Monsters, H.R. Giger’s designs for the Alien franchise, and the work of artists including Giacometti, Marisol, and Basquiat.“Huma Bhabha’s eccentric characters captivate through contradiction, seemingly forged in geological time yet animated with a visceral sense of immediacy,” said Public Art Fund Executive & Artistic Director Nicholas Baume. “Before The End is set amidst the expansive landscape of Brooklyn Bridge Park, a site where natural and man-made elements converge, allowing the works to take on a profound sense of connection to the earth.”Situated in staggered positions along the Pier 3 Uplands at Brooklyn Bridge Park, Bhabha’s monumental sculptures will conjure a sense of mystery and ambiguity. Surrounded by formidable landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty, One World Trade, and the waterways and bridges between boroughs, viewers are prompted to contemplate these totemic, larger-than-life forms. The park itself also serves as a significant setting, having undergone an evolution over time that conceals the rubble of centuries of history beneath its surface.Before The End is Bhabha’s second time presenting work with Public Art Fund, following the inclusion of her sculpture, The Orientalist, in the group exhibition Statuesque at City Hall Park in 2010. She continues to push the boundaries of contemporary sculpture with her unique visual language. Bhabha’s hybrid forms seem to exist in their own parallel universe, offering visitors an opportunity to reflect upon their own time and place.Huma Bhabha: Before The End is curated by Public Art Fund Executive & Artistic Director Nicholas Baume with support from Public Art Fund Assistant Curator Jenée-Daria Strand.",Huma Bhabha: Before The End,"Brooklyn Bridge Park, Pier 3 Greenway Terrace, NY 11201","All day, every day", 30 Apr 2024 - 9 Mar 2025

He accumulated images to inform his theatre, from medieval paintings and Chinese theatre to contemporary clothing and industrial production, and also recorded social and political events and their actors – politicians, soldiers, workers and people on the street – in a collage project that played out across notebooks, journals and manuscripts. Brecht’s dramatic works were often constructed in fragments of text, cut out and reorganised as montages on large sheets of paper. Alongside a selection of these, the exhibition will display original manuscripts, made by Brecht while in exile, that document the devastation of the Second World War. With the exception of War Primer, Brecht’s image-text essay about war under capitalism, most of this material remains little-known.Twice a day throughout the exhibition, actors will lead visitors through Raven Row, performing dramatic fragments from four of Brecht’s unfinished plays from the 1920s, showing how montage and snapshot techniques played a crucial part in his conception of playwriting. Audiences will be asked to consider class conflict and poverty in The Breadshop, the excesses of stock trading in Fleischhacker, a man-made apocalypse in The Flood and a tank crew deserting the front line in Fatzer. Sets for these performances will further animate Brecht’s archive, reproducing his writing about the plays as well as research material he gathered to inform them, and revealing the profound role that visual conceptualisation played in his creative and political thinking.brecht: fragments is curated by Phoebe von Held, in collaboration with Tom Kuhn, Alex Sainsbury, and Iliane Thiemann from the Bertolt Brecht Archive at the Akademie der Künste, Berlin.

Cloth is sacred in many African societies – it is woven in the home, primarily by women, based on traditions that have been passed down over generations. Its domestic connotations provide it a texture and intimacy that other art practices lack. Yet cloth is currency as well as culture – opening the doors to division and conflict. For this reason, many of the artists in this exhibition use second-hand or natural fibers, thereby stitching their stories into larger communal narratives.Agnes Waruguru, Fiker Solomon, and Elfreda Fakoya deploy natural dyes and fibers to explore the relationship between their communities and the natural world, rooting their work in the physical landscapes they inhabit and the skills they have accumulated and internalized from other women in their lives. Layering acrylic paint and natural pigment on cotton and watercolor paper, Waruguru maps what she calls “memoryscapes” while Solomon weaves together biodegradable and natural materials such as jute to craft complex geographies that underscore the interdependence between nature and society. Likewise, Fakoya’s series, Seeds of Becoming, constructs hanging leather tapestries that reflect intergenerational lineages and the path toward self-realization.Other works in the exhibition speak to the influence of respectively Western commodities and gendered expectations, which often conflict with indigenous value systems and personal agency. In Beauty Lesson 1 - Never Clean Your Face with Water (2022), Sedireng Mothibatsela paints onto a linen canvas a Johnson & Johnson baby oil bottle, an item used by her South African grandmother that highlights the impact of globalization and the pervasive search for a Western beauty ideal. Also touching on gendered, ritualist practices, Rawan Abbas confronts arbitrary valuation systems, especially as they relate to the removal and loss of body hair. In I Cut It So It Doesn’t Break My Neck (2024), a long, winding wig made out of synthetic hair and fibers as a serpent might wrap around its prey, calls attention to the complex politics of sexual decorum in Egyptian society.While the works above investigate the impact of societal ideals, Yoma Emore creates works that illustrate complex diasporic identities. Emore’s Traveler’s Map (2023) series combines jute, a textile commonly used in traditional Nigerian weaving practices, with painted text in order to recreate new geographies out of existing maps with the goal of documenting the lived experiences of those on the margins, stories that risk being permanently erased.Gladys Kalichini challenges the prospect of erasure by promulgating new practices of story-telling and collaboration, bringing together a group of women from Los Angeles to source fabric from Downtown Los Angeles, share oral histories and explore new rituals while co-creating a new installation. In doing so, Kalichini illustrates the ways in which nurturing dormant histories have the power to generate new collective memories.By bringing these disparate artists and their respective cultural practices together in one room, this exhibition uncovers the political, social, and cultural valence of textile in contemporary African art. Soft, pliable, and unrelentingly ritualistic, textile practices reveal connections and tensions between past, present, and future that we often overlook.The artists participating in this exhibition are:Rawan Abbas, EgyptYoma Emore, NigeriaElfreda Fakoya, NigeriaGladys Kalichini, ZambiaSedireng Mothibatsela, BotswanaFiker Solomon, EthiopiaAgnes Waruguru, KenyaRele is committed to nurturing artists and cultural practitioners from across the African continent, the extended Global South, diasporic communities, and beyond.

These modifications became further translated through Havekost’s manual process of painting. The final image did not reflect a photographic precision, but rather a series of transient moments that capture an abstracted perception. The intentional ‘errors’ make the image appear more natural and visually pleasing, while the attenuated distortion transforms an instance of banality into one of harmonious beauty.Eberhard Havekost (1967–2019) was born in Dresden, Germany, the son of a sculptor and a taxidermist. As a student of the renowned Dresden Kreuzschule, he sang with the Kreuzchor and participated in international concert tours until his voice changed. After graduating in the mid-eighties, he completed his training as a stonemason. Before the fall of the wall, Havekost fled from East to West Germany via Budapest in 1989. From 1991 to 1996, he studied painting at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, finishing his time as a master student of Ralf Kerbach. In 1995, he had his first solo exhibition at Galerie Gebr. Lehmann in Dresden. Havekost received a scholarship in the mid-nineties to go to Frankfurt, where he immersed himself in the techno club scene, and later moved to Berlin where he lived and worked for the rest of his life. In 2010, Havekost was appointed Professor of Painting at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf.Havekost’s work has been presented in numerous solo exhibitions at institutions such as the Rudolfinum, Prague, Czech Republic; Museum der Moderne, Salzburg, Austria; Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, Germany; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt, Germany; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, the Netherlands and Kunstmuseum, Wolfsburg, Germany. Recent gallery exhibitions include Eberhard Havekost: Paintings 1998-2016, Anton Kern Gallery, New York, NY (2023); Zufall–Bilder aus den Jahren 2017–2019, CFA, Basel, Switzerland (2024); and Havekost meets: Hermann Glöckner (with Hermann Glöckner), Galerie Gebr.

Certainly, in respect to her previous exhibition, the strength and brightness of colour has become bolder and filled with positivity and joy which is surely related to the wonders of childhood which the artist is currently experiencing to the full. This has awakened in the artist, extremes of sensation and emotion but coupled with hope and fear. ‘Rawness, honesty and vulnerability meets protective shells that can be seen bursting open in these works’. (Araminta Blue)Nature is an ever-present in these works, particularly wind, water and light yet also birth and pain.Araminta Blue’s paintings have always featured space as much as gesture. There are moments of great intensity allied to other moments of extreme calm. Hands and legs appear out of gesture and abstraction. In ‘Red Sun’ the extended arms reach upwards to the heat and light of the red sun but within the same work there are various branches from unseen trees, everything co-existing in the same space.In ‘Sea Bed’, the gestures are denser and wilder with an arm and hand emerging from what appears to be the seabed with fishes also prominent.In ‘Sea’, the artist creates a richly and very expressively painted face, lying on her back in a maelstrom of movement and rich, lush colour that recalls Burne-Jones’s ‘Ophelia’. This iconic image also casts its shadow over the painting ‘Light Filters Through’ and ‘Sunrise’. However,there is yes aping a previous work but more a subtle acknowledgement towards the history of art and more specifically British art.The freedom of gesture, assured handling of paint and colour makes her appear to be an artist with far greater years to her career . ‘Sunrise’ is a case in point where another beautifully painted head full of strong colours is lying on what appears to be a sea, whilst above a bright sun is bringing it’s light to a new day. Whereas ‘Sunrise’ is bathed in a golden light, ‘Cold Sun’ as the title suggests is icy cold, the sun, a shining white light, with an elongated blue figure diving down away from the light.The largest painting on view is the triptych ‘Light and Time’ where, on the central panel, a reclining body is lying down, whilst on the top of the canvas a hand and what could be a long leg reach out to the first panel where a fading sun looks over a hazy landscape.The element of nature intermingled with human hands dominates the third and last part of the work. With the increased ambition of size, the artist has created a very brave and ambitious mixture between painterly gesture and empty space.There is a palpable sense of movement and of everything being in flux in these paintings with the figures nearly always reaching upwards or downwards towards the light or away from the light . The ‘energy’ the artist speaks of is readily visible and helps give the works their originality.In this, only her second solo exhibition in the gallery, Blue has produced a great leap forward from ‘Silt’, her first show. Both the freedom with which she uses space and the highly original way she has found to allow figuration to appear mysteriously out of abstraction, belie an artist who is continually trying to the boundaries of her practice.Araminta Blue was born 1990 in Cyprus. She currently lives and works in London.Blue graduated with a Master’s in painting from the Slade School of Art in 2019 and holds a BA Hons from Ruskin School of Art. She has received numerous accolades including the Artists Collecting Society Studio Prize and was shortlisted for the Chadwell Award, Derek Hill Scholarship and the Hix Award. Blue’s works have been presented in various solo and group exhibitions across the UK. Her recent works have been showcased in Christie’s and Bonhams London.Araminta Blue is interested in how the imagined space can be used as an escape and protection from our ‘reality’, whilst at the same time it can help us view the real experience with an added clarity.The oil paint is either diluted to act like watercolour, applied in washes, scrubbed with rags or thickened to a clay or cement-like consistency that is slicked and scratched. The canvas is treated like a drawing on paper: the process of making the work is open to the viewer in the translucent layers and visibly scrubbed out marks. The subjects weave together, emerging and dissolving into the canvas.Colliding different uses of paint and adapting forms help to express fragmented bodily sensation. Parts of figures are seen as fragile, vulnerable, transient - pieces are missing, absorbed into the setting. Other parts are more vibrant and energetic with intense colour. Then other areas have a sense of strength, protective armour or shell-like layers. The subjects are familiar yet unplaceable, allowing for interpretative narratives.",Araminta Blue: Sun Wreck,"37 Rathbone Street, W1T 1NZ",Mon-Sat 11am-6pm, 10 May  - 15 Jun 2024

Rather than favoring the conventional illusion of shared time and space, here each actor was filmed separately, thousands of miles and often months apart, a method integral to its story of human connection made only through effort. Adapted for a gallery setting, the work now adds new dimensions both thematically and quite literally, spreading the performances across three strategically placed screens within a space enclosed by a massive curtain (evoking the intimacy and proportions of a train car). The viewer is immersed, as in a dream of being “in the middle of the movie,” invited to physically navigate and interact with the exchanges surrounding them.As the forced spatial perspective of the single-screen cinema is dissolved, so is its temporal experience—the non-linear structure of the story particularly well-suited to a gallery environment with no set start or end time, where no one viewer’s encounter will quite replicate another’s. Unlike a movie, there is no passive viewing, only personal interpretation and discovery.“There There” demonstrates Bujalski’s versatility and forms a unique contribution to the evolving dialogue between cinema and installation work. The project is a testament to contemporary art’s dynamic and ever-changing landscape, where traditional forms are constantly being interrogated, reinvented, and expanded to forge exciting new connections.

The canvases are imbued with symbolic motifs such as aircraft, guns and open scripture that act as visual signifiers to prompt important questions around the dissemination of truth and violence. Representative of the artist’s signature style, his works are filled with contorted figures with overlapping limbs and withering bodies, whilst exploring the notion of family and the domestic setting. His subjects embody both strength and weakness. The figures proudly display their scars, symbolic of the battles they’ve conquered. Simultaneously, the translucency of their bodies displays a certain vulnerability as they’re laid bare to the viewer. A focus on portraiture and figurative painting reveals the artist’s classical education and early inspiration from traditional Ethi-opian iconography. Urgessa’s works are occupied with question around race, the politics of identi-ty, and the psychological tension hidden within domestic settings, as the artist carefully addresses these contemporary issues and confronts them in his tremendous paintings.Tesfaye Urgessa comments, “I want my figures to have almost an emotional vulnerability...

Her works often begin with pure color, whilst also incorporating, and destabilizing, images from direct observation, or sourced from art history and popular culture.Michael Igwe is an artist from Lagos, Nigeria working primarily in painting. In treating art as a critical exploration of the personal, his practice engages with the fluidity of human experience and memory.Harminder Judge’s paintings, imbued with vibrancy and depth, reference Indian neo-tantric painting, as well as the Abstract Expressionist and color field movements of the 20th century.

Presenting stories of his own life and those of friends and family, Moore weaves in multiple references to history, art, politics, and literature to complete the emotionally resonant narratives of his work.Taj Poscé thematically constructs compositions by collaging archival research materials, construction materials, and studio-based materials. Employing iconographic and symbolic motifs, his paintings are loaded with emotional rigor, spirit and imagination that respond to, reconstruct, and reclaim imagery connected to Black histories, culture, and experiences.Harmonia Rosales’s artistic practice centers on the empowerment of Black and Latinx women in Western culture. In her realist painting, she simultaneously challenges and derives inspiration from the aesthetics of Renaissance painting and Greek mythology to construct alternative narratives.SANGREE is a Mexico City–based collaboration between artists René Godínez-Pozas and Carlos Lara.

McCloud’s abstract stamped paintings combine unconventional industrial materials such as aluminum sheeting, silver aluminum butane paint, and black liquid tar on tar paper with traditional pigments and woodblock printing techniques. Transitioning from the elaborate ornamentation of previous works in this series, McCloud has simplified the design to a single, minimal repeating shape. Streamlining this process has allowed for a repetitive, though more nuanced, intuitive approach. This change reflects a newfound confidence in his artistic vision, prompting him to question the necessity of each element within the composition. McCloud also embraces a more vibrant palette inspired by his time in Mexico.As McCloud revisits his Burdened Man series, he finds himself more personally connected to the imagery, seeing his reflection in carrying the burden of life’s experiences within the works. Despite the meticulous and exacting creative process – using hundreds, even thousands, of small cut-out pieces of single use plastic to “paint” the compositions – these new figurative works incorporate abstract elements, embracing a sense of freedom in his approach to representational imagery. McCloud's flower series, on view in the front gallery, were initially begun as a daily meditative practice during the pandemic to document the passage of time. The works are constructed of single-use plastic with oil paint to accentuate the blossoms. There are also watercolors on the wax paper McCloud uses in the fabrication of his plastic paintings.As with all of McCloud’s oeuvre, material regeneration is a prevalent connection within his work. His ability to elevate industrial elements into fine art materials is consistent throughout the exhibition, serving as a linear narrative that underscores his dedication to pushing boundaries and exploring the breadth of his creativity.Hugo McCloud lives and works in Los Angeles. His work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut, The Arts Club, London, and Fondazione 107, in Turin, Italy.

Is it seductiveness or dread? Is it life or death? Perhaps things do not necessarily have to be in a state of “either/or,” and do not have to be in harmony, but embedded in a heterogenous apparatus of push and pull—existing at the same time, in the same painting.Drew Dodge’s paintings are synergetic systems, colossal monuments that house both life and death. The different motifs that build his paintings are suffused with an explicit symbolism while simultaneously existing as alluring enigmas. And yet, the divergent symbols synchronize, conglomerating into one image whose coherence has distinctness as an underlying ground.Many of Dodge’s motifs have been utilized throughout art history and are charged with meaning that he carries on while simultaneously recontextualizing it. For example, the image of the bull that has been historically used as a symbol of power and stereotypical masculinity (which has turned out to be a rather fragile, disintegrating concept) is reinterpreted by the artist through a queer lens, subverting patriarchal notions by employing an empathic and sensitive perspective. He thereby disrupts and questions societal structural issues without being overtly political; and without any systemic critique becoming too blatant. Recurring ribbons and ropes—opposing forces that are filaments of life or constraining forces—likewise reference subversive notions of power.Another recurring motif in Dodge’s exhibition work is the skull. As the ultimate representation of death and mortality, the skull resides at an intersection of animacy and demise. The artist’s similarly surreal chimeras—dog and human hybrids—which are present as protagonists in every painting often directly interact with the skull; at times they caress it, use it as a tool or instrument, or it simply acts as their companion. While the skull is a reminder of every person’s mortality, it also acts as a representative of the earthly pleasure you got to experience prior to your death.The uncanny chimeras switch in their body language, which is sometimes relaxed and calm and at other times agitated and seemingly disturbed. Their concurrent playfulness and absurdity, referencing cartoons, transports them to a psychological painterly space that is real and unreal, a dreamlike state where experiences from the physical world merge with the imaginative.Having grown up in Arizona, Dodge had to frequently drive through the desert to visit his father who lived far away from his mother. Certain landscapes in the exhibition’s paintings are reminiscent of this childhood memory that sometimes also appears as a fragmented idea, for example only through cacti, which symbolize the physical, visceral, and fleshly. For the artist, deserts are blank canvases, wastelands that are entrenched with emotions and sexuality.Dodge’s use of such enigmatic figures and symbols stem from a desire to uncover the world while letting it remain distant and opaque, somewhat milky, until it becomes accessible. His motifs are flirting with each other, echoing each other, until they become one—sexy and strange, taunting and bewitching, tumultuous and tranquil.Claire Koron Elat",Drew Dodge: Earth Song,"44 rue Quincampoix, 75004",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 4 May  - 15 Jun 2024

Freeze… on the image. Yet there’s nothing to do with photographic snaps in all of this, but rather the clash of two cultures. Firstly, that of computer software, 3D imaging, video games and a training course at an animation school—in short, the digital image and the screen, the protective barrier that a teenage Justin erected between himself and the conservative, homophobic environment of Suffolk County on Long Island.Then in 2017, he began to paint, a change of direction confirmed by a visit to the Louvre in 2019, a watershed moment that “literally changed my life and certainly my way of painting.” Today in 2024, All Sunsets Risen showcases the state of grace of this dual movement of liberation: that of leaving the screen behind, as if coming out of the closet, integrating queer culture into canvasses that speak of masculine tastes, depicted in a classical tradition. In order to appreciate just how far he’s come, one needs to take a look at Justin Liam O’Brien’s early paintings. At first, his figures were more rounded and simplified, still influenced by 3D modelling: “the way I approach light, shadow, color and form is undeniably influenced by digital images.” As time went by, his figures became more refined, as if unfolding with each passing painting; necks, wrists and hands elongated in poses that remind us of the men portrayed by Pontormo, Bronzino and Parmigianino. There are no women in this series of paintings and the generally male figures are treated with an avowed mannerist femininity. “Men are my subject, without thinking in terms of gender, but rather in terms of this belief: every painting is a self-portrait.”What does this statement entail? The word “belief” that connects these group scenes, portraits of young men, the painter’s friends, his intimate community, all linked by the depiction of hands, right down to their fingertips, hands that evoke the rhetorical expressiveness of religious paintings. Two index fingers touch, in a scene from a date in a café, a profane promise of a loving “creation.” A bent wrist, seen in a rear-view mirror, reflecting the Deposition of Christ by Pontormo or Bronzino, while a plane pulls a banner through the skies overhead, with the biblical message “There’s only one way to heaven.” Elsewhere, we see a close-up of two palms turned upwards towards the sky in a gesture known as supination.So, what is Justin Liam O’Brien’s essentially narrative painting seeking to tell us? In what or in whom does he believe? Perhaps a world of men united by the idea of redemptive love, a queer community of disciples of whom he would be the “creator.” His first exhibition at Semiose bears witness to the “honeymoon period” of this highly original world, where people fall in love as if for the very first time. When asked where the title came from, Justin replied: “On Valentine’s Day, I wrote a poem in an attempt to find a coherent vision for this series of paintings:All sunsets risen,the heavens and earth merged.Can you measure such a space?As it expands and contractsWhat about hope?Can you measure hope?”So, is it possible to measure hope? Yes, you just have to believe!Laurent Goumarre",Justin Liam O’Brien: All Sunsets Risen,"44 rue Quincampoix, 75004",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 4 May  - 15 Jun 2024

An artistic polymath, Chicago’s work is defined by a commitment to craft and experimentation, either through her choice of subject matter or the method and materials she employs.Throughout her six-decade career, Chicago has contested the absence and erasure of women in the Western cultural canon, developing a distinctive visual language that gives visibility to their experiences. To this aim, Chicago has produced both individual and collaborative projects that grappled with themes of birth and creation, the social construct of masculinity, her Jewish identity, notions of power and powerlessness, extinction, and expressed her longstanding concern for climate justice.Judy Chicago: Revelations charts the full arc of Chicago’s career with a specific focus on drawing, highlighting rarely seen works. Several immersive, multi-media elements, including an AR app, a video recording booth, and other audio-visual components, set this show apart from previous surveys of Chicago’s work. With never-before-seen sketchbooks, films and slides, video interviews of participants from The Dinner Party (1974–79), audio recordings, and a guided tour of The Dinner Party by Chicago herself, this novel approach to exhibiting Chicago’s work makes the artist’s presence felt throughout the gallery.The exhibition takes its name from an unknown illuminated manuscript Chicago penned in the early 1970s which will be published for the first time in conjunction with the exhibition by Serpentine and Thames & Hudson. Titled Revelations, this visionary work is a radical retelling of human history recovering some of the stories of women that society sought to erase, and one that Chicago never imagined would be published in her lifetime. Audio excerpts from the book can be heard in each of the galleries through an accompanying audio guide, seamlessly creating a link between visual art and written word that has occupied the artist’s practice since the 1970s.",Judy Chicago: Revelations,"West Carriage Drive, W2 2AR",Tue-Sun 10am-6pm, 23 May  - 1 Sep 2024

Caroline Achaintre, Anna Higgins, Niamh O’Malley, Aimée Parrott, Stephen PolatchThe exhibition takes its title from a term in grammar which exists beyond a familiar distinction between the active and passive voices. Although the middle voice is not formally marked in English (as it is in classical Greek and Sanskrit) it is present in our language and allows to map out a multi-specied agency, away from a human-centric assumption of mankind as ‘actors’ in an ‘inert’ natural environment. Evident in such verbs as ‘observe’, ‘witness’ or ‘partake’, middle voice suggests an efficacy that both receives and twists. That is, middle voice denotes actions where the subject is not anterior to the field of action, coming before it takes place, but rather interior to it, inextricably part of the way in which it unfolds (another example in modern language is ‘je suis n’, ‘I am born’). Distinct from an inherent hierarchy between an ‘agent’ and ‘patient’ characteristic of active and passive voices, middle-voiced expression thus acknowledges the profound entanglement of human and non-human, the simultaneity of acting and being acted upon in the world.Bringing together works by Caroline Achaintre, Anna Higgins, Niamh O’Malley, Aimée Parrott, Stephen Polatch, the exhibition explores the possibility of expressing a middle-voiced view in visual terms – locating the ineffable sense of push/pull with the external world, felt in materials, mark-making process, or in the presence of the work in space.Executed from thin slabs of clay, Caroline Achaintre’s ceramic sculptures appear to rise, ripple and coil into three-dimensional forms, as if animated by a presence. Gently bending partially dry sheets of clay, the artist is led by its physical properties, continually negotiating and responding to the inherent malleability and brittleness. In each work Achaintre impresses the surface with patterns evocative of tree barks, shells or animal skin, constructing a sense of a porous, moist, breathing being. At once seductive and strange, the glistening curves of her sculptures lock our gaze, creating an anticipation of motion and exchange.Painstakingly building his compositions by layering contrasting marks, Stephen Polatch flexes the scale and momentum of each object, creating a sense of equivalence between the human and non-human. Inhabiting familiar cityscapes, his figures are manifestly in mysterious interdependence with their surroundings, on par with plants, architecture and bodies of water. In Tulips, a flower towers over and rhymes with the bending figure, underscored by concealed letters spelling out ‘tulips’ along the bottom of the composition. Each object here appears in motion, dissolving our conceptions of causation and what constitutes an ‘actor’ in space.Aimée Parrott works into unprimed support, interweaving dyeing, mark-making and stitching together of multiple canvases, to imbue the surface with a living, membrane-like quality. Fusing sinuous lines with staccato pointillist mark-making, the works tie in suggestions of micro and marco, cellular processes, sea organisms or landscapes seen from afar, often projecting a sense of pulsating expansion. Employing monotype technique as a starting point in her compositions, Parrott balances free gestures with a lack of complete control; she says, “in beginning a painting I like to imagine just enabling it to arrive, being receptive to materials and circumstance almost like a conduit.”In Niamh O’Malley’s considered sculptures in wood, stone, metal and glass, one encounters a lure of the familiar and an impulse for touch. Warm curving surfaces combine with lucid planes and right angles, highlighting the power of materials to shift our experience of safety, communality and belonging, both in private and public spaces. Comprising a banister-like form adjacent to a delicate composition in glass and wood, Blind (2023) inflects our movement, drawing us in yet physically resisting a close encounter. O’Malley’s glass works at once admit and refract light, responding to and transforming the space around them, slowly revealing the modes of seeing along and through the translucent surface.Layering fields of colour with silhouettes and shadows of familiar objects, Anna Higgins’ cinematic works seem lit from within, evoking shapes experienced after looking at the sun or discerned in dimming light. In Night, the outlines of leaves and tree branches come in and out of focus upon extended looking, oscillating between recognition and doubt, and thus probing the veracity of human vision. Iterating marks in watercolour and chalk pastel with photographic transfers and waves of light captured through the lens, Higgins works intuitively, seeking to step beyond the rational towards the ‘felt’, conjuring a sense of affect and mysticism in natural forms.Text by Maria HinelHeader image: Caroline Achaintre.

Sim Smith,London,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/tim-garwood/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Tim Garwood,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/tim-garwood/,"The exhibition continues Garwood’s exploration of the rich possibilities of painting through diverse aesthetic strategies and materials that have become synonymous with his practice including glass, glitter, jute and lace. The paintings in this exhibition mark a moving on, or rather a moving through, his painterly language with the inclusion of further materials; dried flowers, splintered wood and plant fronds, denoting a body of work that is unconsciously but undeniably, deeply rooted in the new surroundings of his Somerset studio in rural England, with connotations of the landscape seeping into and pouring over, each abundant and encrusted surface.A painter of intuition and spontaneity, Garwood has always gathered materials from the area in and around his studio to construct paintings. Originally based in London, the materials available consisted of scraps from local fabric shops, found metal objects, shoelaces, burger boxes and articles collected from the street, dipped, sprayed and slathered with paint. Painterly invention has always been fundamental to Garwood’s practice and has developed into a new, unsuspected pictural narrative for this exhibition.“When I’m making work, I’m not thinking about re-creating something I’ve seen or felt, I’m more interested in balancing colour or material but actually, these works feel like landscapes, or the feeling of a landscape at least. After I made the painting Sky Through Naked Trees, I was lying in bed looking out of the window and I saw my painting in the landscape, I had made when I was then seeing.”– Garwood, May 2024The paintings are constructed though unbeknownst observations and memories of discoveries in the landscape, through mists, downpours and blazing suns. Structures of raindrops on a windscreen may lead to splatters of glitter across heavily painted works, fronds of fabric seem to embody burly hillsides, and gusts of wind take on forms of flurries of splintered wood seemingly soaring across the canvas. Marks that look like possible animal tracks are scratched into abundant daubes of paint and north stars appear as collaged gemstones. And yet, these wildly abstract paintings refuse to settle into a form of representational landscape and instead continue Garwood’s expansive painterly practice, constantly investigating the ways that colours exist in relation to each other, the weight and capability of his materials and the transformative capabilities of painting “…. heightening the stakes of the dramas and tensions of painting - between physicality and levity, transparency and colour, control and surrender.”– Tomas Weber, 2022The outcome is something ethereal, a capturing of an energy that is hard to explain but seemingly familiar. They feel like they have always been in existence, familiar like the seasons. Garwood speaks about the cyclical nature of the countryside, the flailing of hedges for example only happening at certain times of year, leaving roads and paths scattered with shredded tree and hedge fragments. In these works, we see leaves, plant fronds, and splintered wood embedded, suggesting feelings of seasonality and perhaps temporality, which may be enhanced by the inclusion of old watch faces collaged into the works. They emerge somewhere between the foreground and background, sometimes identifiable and sometimes obliterated by heavy layers of paint, glitter and collage. Antique keys also appear, only to disappear again, dissolving into the canvas perhaps implying the repetition and history of a life and sense of home and belonging. Many of the materials are limited - either impossible to locate at certain times or in the case of the long grass fronds, simply not alive to harvest, making the paintings part of the landscape and seasons in the most fundamental way.“The materials are not available to me at any time of the year, I wouldn’t be able to even buy them at certain times which is quite amazing today. Whether it’s a plant or an antique object, I can’t always find it, this almost always gets me hunting for something new. In one painting I have used a beaded flower my daughter made and that’s a one-off too.”– Garwood, May 2024These are not paintings that can be resolved quickly, they brew and steep, submerge and are saturated. They weather and withstand, succumb and stick out. There is a vitality in the work that speaks to a very visceral part of our being. In the absence of literal depictions, Garwood takes us to a place of memory through association, by magic almost, only a sense of a place, a feeling remembered - we can feel the wind and the water and can smell the grass, the damp and the heady perfume of fresh pollen. Elemental in their nature, they highlight moments suspended in time, in a striking portrayal of what it means to be present in a landscape that deeply imprints itself into the body.The materials in the works are numerous; poppy seed heads, gemstones, glitter, net curtain, plastic toys to name a few. They appear across works on canvas, jute and glass (a back to front technique which has been a mainstay of Garwood’s practice for some time). As many associations and connotations the new collaged materials may have, Garwood is largely unencumbered by their references, deciding on their application and positioning simply based on how they develop the construction of a painting.Whether one chooses to seek meaning in the works or whether the paintings are viewed as pure abstraction, there has been a shift in ways of looking for Garwood and ways of absorbing his surroundings that are evident. The composting of materials and layers in the paintings continue to evidence his truthful vocabulary, oscillating freely between suggestions of place, collective experience, and association. The paintings are open enough to exist in other terms, although as Garwood says, “The grass does glitter with dew, and the wind does wrap you in leaves and sticks, it’s all around you”. In this exhibition, there are no obstacles between abstraction and association, improvisation, and control, only the endless exploration, transformative capabilities and potential possibilities of painting itself.",Tim Garwood: Loud It Up,"6 Camberwell Passage, SE5 0AX","Fri 10am-4pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 16 May  - 8 Jun 2024

But now a rupture has occurred, the inevitable dislocation that takes place in homes across the world. The child leaves, the mother stays behind. You wouldn’t file a missing person’s report, but there’s an absence all the same.”In these paintings Joffe is seen in the bath, in the kitchen, in bed, sometimes crumpled asleep or deep in thought. Esme is still present, and Richard, her partner, appears asleep in bed, almost lost in a yellow duvet, one big arm exposed. The homage to Philip Guston is acknowledged by the title, Richard in Bed (for P.G.). The sequence of self-portraits also references Guston’s famous bed paintings, which Joffe was inspired by seeing at Tate Modern last winter.The title My dearest dust was suggested to Joffe by Esme, a reference to all the loss the family have experienced and to the dustiness of their home.

Choosing the exhibition title for its personal resonance. Fang explains that it is about both the ‘external and internal’, alluding to the danger presented to us and that we present to society.After moving to New York City at the age of eighteen, Fang was exposed to the gestural and expressive abstractions of Willem de Kooning, Cecily Brown and Jackson Pollock, whose drip paintings in particular opened her eyes to the possibilities of painting. Understanding it to be a bodily experience, Fang loses herself in the rhythmic flowing forms which are unpredictable yet beautifully harmonious, describing the entire process as akin to running a marathon. In this way, the cathartic act of painting facilitates the release of unrestrained emotions through the physicality of the medium. Not only do her prodigious paintings reflect the anxieties inherent to New York, but they are also an outlet for the artist’s residual childhood frustrations of feeling at odds with the strict rules in place within Asian culture.The exhibition centres on both the literal and metaphorical associations of water. The title, Dangerous Waters, refers to the tumultuous and uncertain world we live in. Yet, on another level, it highlights water as a spatially divisive body, separating continents with vast oceans, which paintings like Sea Storm or Frozen Waves 02 evoke. Drawn to repetitive organic formations, Fang’s oeuvre conjures strong oceanic associations, cautioning the viewer with undertones of danger as hinted in the painting’s titles, such as Dark Clouds 02 or Dark Forest Strolling. From the artist’s birthplace in coastal Shenzhen to the East River in New York, water holds a particular significance to the artist, a familiarity that shines through in the energy and fluidity of her paintings.Interlaced with feminity, Dangerous Waters explores traditional Chinese associations between women and water. The character Jia Baoyu in Dream of the Red Chamber (1791) said, ‘Women are like water, possessing spirituality like water, goodness like water, resilience like water, and tenderness like water.’ These feminine associations carry through into Fang’s paintings as she explores the symbolism between the two. On the one hand, women are associated with the life-giving properties of water, yet Fang also understands ‘dangerous waters’ to be an allegory for the volatility of feminine desire, both in strength and devastation. Accented with dusty pink hues, Lady’s Eardrops masterfully reflects the female experience, using shades of pinks, peaches and reds to celebrate the power of women. Indeed, the colour palette across the series carries meaningful connotations; where pink refers to female desire blue signifies water.Characterised by lyrical and bodily swirls, Yuan Fang’s paintings simultaneously envelop the viewer into an unruly web and elicit soulful contemplations on our civilisation, be that the uncertainty pervasive in today’s geopolitical climate or the broader associations surrounding water as a symbolic entity. Expanding on the multi-layered complexities of her painting, Fang explains that ‘I always wanted to depict a sense of turbulence or chaos which mimics the living condition of human beings.’",Yuan Fang: Dangerous Waters,"8 Bennet Street, SW1A 1RP","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 10am-5pm", 30 May  - 12 Jul 2024

This exhibition offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of Sherman's creative process, tracing the evolution of her seminal series in black and white from its inception to its enduring legacy. Impersonating a variety of film noir female archetypes, from the mysterious self-posessed femme fatale to the submissive, innocent girl, Sherman's ability to inhabit diverse personas challenges viewers to confront their own perceptions of self and society.The premise of the Film Stills found its origin while Sherman was studying photography at Buffalo State University. During this time, Sherman began buying wigs and clothes from thrift stores. Once she moved to New York City, Sherman briefly considered working as a makeup artist. Having studied under and worked for the experimental filmmaker Paul Sharits, Sherman was transfixed by the power of transformation through disguise. Altering factors such as age, social class or gender throughout her career, Sherman has adopted endless identities. For example, in her 1976 Bus Riders series, the artist’s interest in film, body art, and performance began to reveal itself; through the medium of black-and-white photography, the artist began to focus primarily on female roles.In 1977, inspired by low-cost storyboard snapshots she came across in David Salle’s studio, Sherman realized that involving other people in her work would not be necessary. As the Film Stills took shape, she assumed multiple roles as director, author, set designer, makeup artist, hairstylist, casting director, costume designer, and actress in her own veritable one-woman show. The photographs feature the artist in stereotypical female roles inspired by 1950s and ‘60s Hollywood and European art-house films. Presenting an array of characters, Sherman implicates the viewer in constructing the identity of her protagonist. Locations include her fellow artist Robert Longo’s apartment and her own studio. She also used every corner of her flat as an interior set, converting her home into a hotel lobby or room, a hallway, a bathroom.Traditionally, film stills are not individual frames from movies but rather purpose-built reenactments used as a tool for promotion: ‘The still must tease with the promise of a story the viewer of it itches to be told’ (Arthur Danto, Cindy Sherman: Untitled Film Stills, New York, 1990, p. 9). Sherman carefully selects the close-ups, zooming into specific expressions. She invites the viewer into her intimate photographic realm. Rooting herself within the Pictures Generation, Sherman critically reworks the female image through cinematic context, borrowing from the visual style and aesthetic universe of Alfred Hitchcock, subverting his archetypal film narrative. While some photographs portray a solitary woman, others allude to another person outside the frame or suggest the sitter is being watched or followed, creating a palpable tension. Sherman depicts the exact moment preceding or following “the decisive moment”, creating an open-ended discourse. With this series, Sherman aimed to break away from the preciousness of painting and fashion trends at the time, turning instead to low-quality prints and dressing up in old-fashioned looks from the ‘50s and ‘60s.Sherman brought the series to a close in 1980, with a total of seventy photographs, when she noticed she was beginning to repeat herself and that her work had become fashionable. Yet, even now, Sherman’s Film Stills continue to confront the oppressive influence of mass media over our individual and collective identities, particularly the notion of domination and desire imposed by the ‘male gaze’. Placing the female character within the dicta of Laura Mulvey’s influential 1975 essay ‘Visual Pleasure and the Narrative Cinema’, which discusses the female onscreen persona as an objectified subject, Sherman addresses the portrayal of women within the ‘magic of the Hollywood style at its best...[which] arose, not exclusively but in one important aspect from its skilled and satisfying manipulation of visual pleasure’ (Laura Mulvey in Movies & Methods, vol. II, p. 306).‘Desire mixed with nostalgia fuels the allure of the Untitled Film Stills’ (Amanda Cruz ‘Movies, Monstrosities, and Masks: Twenty Years of Cindy Sherman’ in: Cindy Sherman Retrospective, exh. cat., Los Angeles, The Museum of Contemporary Art, 1998, p. 4). Commenting on the gravitas of her protagonists, the artist notes ‘I definitely felt that the characters were questioning something, perhaps being forced into a certain role. At the same time, those roles are in a film: the women aren’t being life-like, they’re acting. There are so many levels of artifice. I liked that whole jumble of ambiguity’. (Cindy Sherman, quoted in Cindy Sherman, exh. cat., The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2012, p. 30).

Since the late 1990s, Cinthia Marcelle has been creating material- intensive and performative installations and video works, many of them made in partnership with Tiago Mata Machado, as poetic-metaphorical images that question conventional ways of perceiving and behaving, how we see the world and our role in it, and disrupt habitual routines and categorizing patterns. Marcelle repeatedly blurs the supposedly fixed binary opposition of concepts such as order– chaos, fiction–reality, rule–exception, submission–resistance, or inside–outside. She points out that conventions and norms are never fixed and that the meaning of things always depends on the specific perspective and context of consideration.The exhibition at Sprovieri is centered on the eponymous installation em-entre-para-perante #2 [in- between-to-towards #2] (2015/2024), which was created for her survey exhibition “Disobedient Tools” at Marta Herford Museum in 2023 and is re-staged here. It is a new version of a work that she had originally developed in 2015 for the gallery Silvia Cintra + Box4 in Rio de Janeiro.em-entre-para-perante #2 consists of a floor installation made of metal objects that are bound with black shoelaces and arranged in a grid-like formation, six “paintings” and two clipboards with fax printouts hanging on the wall.The shape of the objects on the floor suggests that they could have been employed to break open or break out of something. Here, however, they lie carefully wrapped in black shoelaces, thereby robbed of their potential function as tools. The binding and bandaging is a protective, caring gesture that gives them a cult-like quality. The once hard, cold metal tools become warm and dysfunctional objects. Their object status and thus their meaning have changed.The neutralized “tools” are framed by six painting-like works on the wall – a continuation of a line of work that runs through the artist's entire oeuvre in various forms: Single-colored, vertically striped cotton sheet of which the artist manually paints the machine-printed stripes with white paint. The vertical stripes of the fabric might evoke associations with the bars of a prison, which are seemingly canceled out by the white paint; thus, the act of overpainting appears like an act of liberation. As Cinthia lifts the contrast of the stripes, she disorganizes the fabric's defining pattern – a thoroughly political gesture, not least because of the political connotations of the colors. The width of the stripes, identical to that of the laces, also creates a connection between the neutralized stripes of the painting and those that defuse the tools. Marcelle never stretches her “paintings” on frames, in the manner typical of the Western painting tradition. Marcelle subverts the expectations of painting, which in the Western painting tradition usually takes the form of stretched canvases on frames. Instead, she knots her canvases, hangs them on two corners like drying laundry, or presents them hanging on wooden slats like flags. In other instances, they are bound together in a bundle or are tied around architectural structures. The canvas, which is traditionally a picture support, is transformed by Marcelle into a sculptural object, for example to mark something.The third component of the installation has its own title: Manifesto (2023/24). Every day the artist sends a fax to the gallery with the same image of a manhole into which a rope disappears, that is then attached to a clipboard on top of the previous day's version. Over the course of the exhibition, the dated daily printouts accumulate, whereby the image-defining black on the light-sensitive fax paper increasingly fades due to the impact of external factors. For the first time, Marcelle decided to present here not only the faxes that are arriving daily over the duration of this presentation. She is now also displaying the collection of 115 faxes that arrived and were collected over the corresponding period of its previous presentation at Marta Herford. Both Manifestos are a materialization of the temporal component of the respective work.In the creation of em-entre-para-perante, the work of the legendary Brazilian artist Arthur Bispo do Rosário was a key reference for Cinthia Marcelle. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, Bispo do Rosário spent decades in a psychiatric clinic in Rio de Janeiro, where people were admitted who were considered ""abnormal"" due to a mental disorder or alcoholism and were therefore marginalized. Over the course of nearly five decades, he created an extensive body of work in which he disassembled the uniforms of the supervisory staff and used the yarn to wrap objects found in the clinic or to embroider bed sheets. The resulting works can be read as Bispo’s encyclopedic chronicle of his view of this world and the hereafter. The utilization and distortion of uniforms become a symbolic act of liberation and the basis for the self-determined formation of new narratives. They are a manifestation of his resistance to the pressure of conformity to the normative structures of society.Cinthia Marcelle alludes in em-entre-para-perante #2 to the same metaphor of imprisonment and escape from it to reflect on how hegemonic systems of knowledge hold us back like walls of jail and determine and limit our thinking. The (visual) determinants of binary opposites, through which a certain idea or narrative is formulated and reproduced, are broken down in several ways. Clear attributions become shaky. The functionality of tools and the capacity to create order through the use of rational categories is defused.In her essay Disobedient Tools (1) (2018), Mexican author Gabriela Jauregui speaks of language as a constructive means of escaping entrenched modern, patriarchal systems of thought and dismantling them. She argues that speech is not merely a passive product of a social system and its thought structures but actively shapes this system and can bring about long-term social change. It is therefore up to us to use language as a tool, to adopt it in order to actively shape new thought patterns.Anna Roberta Goetz(1) Gabriela Jaurequi, “Herramientas Desobedientes” in TSUNAMI (Mexico City, 2018), pp.87-100.Credits:em-entre-para-perante [in-between-to-towards]The work was produced with the support of the “Marta Patronage Fund for New Art""Coordination and production: Aline TimaAssistants: Hellena Kuasne, João Leonardo Bordignon (paintings)Ava Miranda, Dominic Stephenson, Julie Mons, Michaela Tibaldo (objects)RhymesReview: Alyne Azuma",Cinthia Marcelle: em-entre-para-perante [in-between-to-towards],"23 Heddon Street, W1B 4BQ",Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, 5 Apr  - 21 Jun 2024  
Sprüth Magers London,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/john-baldessari-ahmedabad-1992/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",John Baldessari,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/john-baldessari/,"In the early weeks of 1992, Baldessari was invited to live and work in the expansive compound of the Sarabhai family, Indian industrialists and patrons of the arts, in the Shahibaug district of Ahmedabad. Members of the prominent family formally set up the residency in the 1970s, but the Sarabhais were interacting with artists, designers and architects long beforehand. Like many patrons and cultural protagonists of post- independence India, they actively engaged with foreign artists and established international networks, hoping to restrain revivalist currents and promote a new vision for the country. Following several other established artists, among them his close friend Lynda Benglis, Baldessari resided in the Villa Sarabhai, a red brick and concrete open-plan house designed by Le Corbusier in the 1950s.The rarely seen multi-panelled works that stem from Baldessari’s stay are a direct response to his new surroundings, which were inspiring and overwhelming in equal measure and had a lasting impact on the artist’s oeuvre. The collages are composed of his own photographs, some enhanced by paint; an eclectic mix of found imagery; rubber mudflaps painted by local sign painters; Formica pieces modelled after parts of local motorised rickshaws; and printed handmade paper collected from the Gandhi ashram in Ahmedabad. Immersing himself in Indian culture, the Californian photographed the bustling city at a time when India was subject to radical changes due to the emergence of new technologies, globalisation processes, and an influx of Westerners.The cleverly devised arrangements of Ahmedabad 1992 document this shift. Here, floating electronics in a futuristic cyberspace point towards the burgeoning technological revolution of the ’90s. There, a sense of motion and transition is reflected in the dominant motifs, including modes of transportation (motorbikes, bicycles, trucks), animals in movement (a cow trotting along the roadside or a bird in flight), and cricket being played or kites being flown. Also at constant play in the series is the alternating and interlacing of looking and being looked at, with several images either observing the action of street scenes or featuring a subject’s direct gaze, and sometimes both.Cornerstone aspects of Baldessari’s practice, like the mining of pre-existing imagery, fell on fertile ground in a place as visually spectacular as India. Images from magazines and the everyday are deconstructed and reassembled to stress their original ambiguity or curiousness. Figures are painted over, withdrawing the underlying information and complicating the reading of the image. Expanding on this sort of erasure, Baldessari produced the Removal Series (1995) shortly thereafter. Also employed in the present works is the use of dots to cover faces, a predominant feature of the artist’s work from the mid-1980s onward, which simultaneously draws the eye to the point of obfuscation and redirects the viewer towards other parts of the image. The resulting works, which Baldessari produced after his return to Santa Monica, expand beyond the sum of their parts and evoke the atmosphere and complexity of Indian scenery through associative juxtaposition.The artist’s signature wry humour gives way to a surprisingly raw view of everyday settings. Entered into new contexts, they are recoded and refuse immediate answers, allowing viewers to generate their own responses. The residency provided him with a unique opportunity to not only observe a new environment, which in many ways contrasted his Los Angeles milieu, but also permitted him to turn a critical lens inward for a period of self-reflection. It is the works’ contingent quality—with each element modifying the next—Baldessari’s vibrant use of colour, and the keen eye of an outsider that render the Ahmedabad series an intimate commentary on what it means to look during a moment of reinvention.John Baldessari (1931–2020) lived and worked in Venice, California. Selected solo exhibitions include Moderna Museet, Stockholm (2020), Laguna Art Museum, Laguna Beach (2019), Museo Jumex, Mexico City (2017), Städel Museum, Frankfurt (2015), Garage Center for Contemporary Culture, Moscow (2013), Fondazione Prada, Milan (2010), Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (2011), and Tate Modern, London (2009), which traveled to Museum of Contemporary Art, Barcelona (2010), Los Angeles County Museum of Art (2010), and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2010–11).

The last master and first modern, Goya’s oeuvre spanned aristocratic portraits, Rococo styled tapestry cartoons, etchings and engravings detailing the trauma of war and satirical meditations on society. His painting Saturn Devouring his Son, dominates the poster designed to accompany this exhibition, A Painting Show.The life of a painter; the journey and transition from subject to subject, period to period, the ability to tackle all manner of subjects, reaching into deep, buried recesses of the human psyche. To dig in any direction with conviction and vigour, to move freely and to really sink one’s teeth into each subject. The leaps between subject and narrative should be fluid, multiple conversations ongoing, the space between the works, subject and manner of approach speak to the capacity of painting to accommodate endless change and the vitality of painting now.Two centuries on, Saturn Devouring His Son could not feel more relevant or timely. The painting reaches deep into the human psyche, our capacity for absolute, unthinkable violence.The transition and transformation to be found in Goya’s work is close to unthinkable.

The artist’s writing flows through themes of dance, African diaspora, musical notation, literature, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and theoretical physics, invoking the guiding voices of the choreographer Katherine Dunham, composer Florence B. Price, theorist Saidiya Hartman, author Toni Morrison, and physicist Carlo Rovelli. Each of Davis’ bodies of work is a study in movement that translates photographs taken by the artist. Though composed on a flat page, Davis recognises her drawings as dimensional vessels, planes where she charts, layers, and reimagines significance.Two of Davis’ series are portrait-based: the first, grouped drawings of figures in various postures. During photo shoots for these studies, the artist invited Black women to come to her studio and improvise movement, capturing their gestures with long-exposure photographs resulting in kinetic, unbound physiques. Drawing closer to the work, portions of Davis’ essay emerge, detailing the extraordinary careers of Katherine Dunham and Florence B. Price, two trailblazing Black creatives of the twentieth century who used art to pursue individual and societal metamorphosis. As a choreographer, Dunham infused dance with her background in anthropology, using her body as a vehicle to express radical ideas about space, time, and diaspora. As the first Black female musician to compose for a national symphony orchestra, Price arranged music to navigate states of instability, transition, and freedom—such as in her rediscovered piece Clouds.Davis’ second portrait series features single drawings of figures framed with recessed mantles that display vessels of various proportions. Designed by the artist and carved by her partner, each of these sculptures was crafted from one of two types of wood: ebony from Ghana, where the artist lived for many years, and ash from Los Angeles, sourced from a tree at her home. These multimedia works can be likened to her series Text(tiles), multi-panel artworks that juxtapose portraits with woven fabrics, underscoring the etymological root of text from the Latin word “to weave.” Inserting a physical vessel into the image plane, she encourages her audience to comprehend that each dimension of the work has the capacity to hold meaning—literally and figuratively.The third series is a group of twelve drawings based on Davis’ snapshots of clouds. Building on the cloud as a symbolic muse for choreography and composition, she considers the natural formation through the lens of quantum physics. As a billowing mass made up of atomic particles, a cloud shifts between states of being solid, liquid, and gas—an element that fluctuates between the micro and macro. Drawing from Rovelli’s writings on the relativity of time, Davis’ compositions encourage her audience to question systems of artistry, science, philosophy, history, race, and gender for which meaning is assigned, not inherent. Welcoming shifting observations and evolving thoughts, her text and image reject an explicit reading.For each work, Davis arranges the text in a new formation to highlight different passages, incising the sculptural passages into a polymer plate, then embossing them onto paper with an etching press. She scores each parchment with a grid - rendering the photograph section by section - using sharpened carbon pencils for portrait works and powdered indigo pigments for cloud works. With an exacting and meticulous hand, she creates a surface that resembles an ancient rubbing, emphasising how light and dark shadows reveal - rather than conceal - essential ideas within her essay. Through the blurred focus of the body, the soft edges of the cloud, and the swelling surface of the vessel, Davis balances the rigid with the fluid; the frame and grid for each serve as structured systems wherein physical and meteorological bodies roam freely.",Kenturah Davis: clouds,"5-6 Cork Street, W1S 3LQ","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 31 May  - 20 Jul 2024

It draws on persistent themes in Judge’s work: life, death, ritual and rebirth, creating parallels between the deconstructed body and the cosmos.Judge is preoccupied with physical and spiritual transformation - a body becoming ash, material becoming immaterial, the physical becoming metaphysical. The show revisits early elements of his practice, extends recent developments in his work, and opens up new areas of exploration. His work sets into motion dialogues between Western Modernism, Indian Neo Tantric painting, American Transcendental painting and familial funeral traditions drawn from rural Punjab.The 'Ghost Dance' of the title refers to a Native American ceremony. This type of circle dance was practised to raise the spirits of the dead in order for them to fight alongside the living to reclaim land from colonial settlers. Over recent years, Judge has developed a distinctive and innovative practice grounded in an extended exploration of pigmented plaster as an artistic medium. The plaster sets – freezing a record of its creation in time – the surface is worked, polished and slowly worn away to reveal layers of colour, texture and movement beneath. This process embraces chance, and over time he has pushed it further with each new work. The results are sensual and seductive, with surfaces appearing sleek and shimmering. They have an illusory quality, seeming to hover in front of the wall, suggesting depth, evoking the idea of a portal or doorway and inviting the viewer to stay with them in contemplation.For Matt’s Gallery, Judge will work at scale, developing a monumental, enveloping expanse of material, pigment and colour for the space and setting this into dialogue with new discreet, floor-based semi-figurative works redolent of funereal urns or totems. For The Sunday Painter, Judge will combine new works on a smaller scale with a like new cadaver-like sculpture devised for their space.A processional performance between the two spaces will take place on the opening night, recalling early performance works by the artist. The exhibition is accompanied by a new essay by writer and curator Susanna Davies-Crook, building on her previous text Spectres and Portals: The Work of Harminder Judge, produced for the artist’s debut solo show in India at Jhaveri Contemporary, Mumbai in 2023.As part of London Gallery Weekend, Judge will be in conversation with Davies-Crook on Saturday June 1st at Matt's Gallery to discuss the two-part exhibition.

Firstly, a long run series of the color photographs, which was started from Homes for America (1966-67), when his analytical bent first appeared. Homes for America is a sequence of photos of suburban development in New Jersey, accompanied by a text charting the economics of land use and the obsolescence of architecture and craftsmanship. In this exhibition, half of the works are from Homes for America, and the second half is a book from Dan Graham’s New Jersey (2012). The photographs he took in 2006, occasion of exhibition and research collaboration, a series of study trips that Graham conducted with faculty from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) and other guests.A series of two juxtaposed photographs are also introduced, taken in the same suburban cityscapes in 1960s, 80s, or 2008, which show a multilayered element of repetition and difference, both spatially and temporally. A series of incorporating two mirrors to practice intersubjective realms is also introduced which started to be seen in the 1970s. Graham’s never changed interest in New Jersey, buildings, kitsch, and America can be seen through the series.Secondly, the model which shows Graham’s interest in psychology and gaze, Clinic for a Suburban Site (1978). A speculative project that raises questions about the boundaries between public and private, the concepts of “inside” and “outside,” and the “traditional disposition of the family space” according to Graham. The facade of a building in an apparently typical American suburb has been replaced by glass, while the house’s interior is divided into public and private sections by a mirror. In doing so, Graham critiques the modernist ideal that the literal transparency of glass in architecture would also lead to social transparency. At the same time that the house’s inhabitants can gaze at the environment and activity outside, they themselves become objects on display, and this concept is connected to Graham’s next development of the pavilion series.Graham’s critical engagement manifests most alluringly in the glass and mirrored pavilions, which he has designed since the late 1970s. The Two-way mirrors within the pavilion, create unexpected reflections and voyeuristic elements simultaneously watching oneself and being able to watch others. Three models of the pavilion is Graham’s last work unveiled in 2022, poised between sculpture and architecture, drawing attention as instruments of expression, psychological strongholds, makers of social change and prisms through which we view others and ourselves.Dan Graham was born in 1942 in Urbana, Illinois, raised in Winfield Township, New Jersey. For fifty years, he had spent most of his career in New York and passed away in 2022.Graham’s work has been included in exhibitions at the Red Brick Art Museum, Beijing, China (2017); the Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio (2016); MAMO, Marseille, France (2015); the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2014); the De Pont Foundation, Tillburg, Netherlands (2014); a traveling retrospective which began at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 2009 and traveled to the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota.Graham participated in the Venice Biennale in 2005, 2003, 1976 and multiple Documentas (1997, 1992, 1982, 1977, 1972). He was awarded the American Academy of Arts and Letters award, New York in 2010; the French Vermeil Medal by the city of Paris in 2001 and the Skowhegan Medal for Mixed Media, New York, 1992.Within Japan, the exhibition, Dan Graham by Dan Graham, was first presented at the Chiba City Museum of Art and subsequently traveled to the Kitakyushu Municipal Museum of Art, both in 2004.",Dan Graham,"6-5-24 3F Roppongi, Minato-ku, #106-0032",Tue-Sat 12-7pm, 28 May  - 22 Jun 2024

In the late 1980s, he started using photography, a medium he has constantly explored and subverted for the last 25 years alongside his work as a painter.The new exhibition features a series of small format photographic artworks. Fruit of his inexhaustible impulse to experiment and delve into the elusive medium of photography, these reworked images centre on a resolutely pared-back palette. The understated black and white landscape occasionally embraces hints of coral or salmon. The apparent simplicity of the colour range opens the door wide to some of the metaphysical questions that obsesses the artist: the body and the mystery of the world’s origins. “I’m interested in the idea of building a framework that refers to the female body,” explains François Rouan.Creating these photographic pieces is a complex, tedious process: he lets his models guide the staging phase before playing with techniques such as multiple exposures and photographic braiding, which he then covers with hatching, dots, tracery or tiny commas. The result is dynamic image, swinging between abstraction and figuration. Rouan’s works are strikingly perceptive, resonating with current concerns such as our relationship to images, the other side of the surface, and the role of art in reconstructing a fragmented material and mental world.The exhibition will be marked by the publication of catalogue in May 2024 featuring a text by Agnès Fabre.Born in 1943 in Montpellier, François Rouan lives and works in Laversine (France). From the beginning of his career in the 1960s, he was associated with the Supports/Surfaces movement without being officially affiliated with it. François Rouan has followed a singular path, deconstructing the traditional structure of the painting to open up new avenues in the field of contemporary painting. Following his research into collages, he produced his first braids in 1965 and from 1980 onwards extended his practice to other mediums, photographic and filmic.",François Rouan: Après-coups,"30 rue Beaubourg, 75003",Tue-Sat 10am-7pm, 4 May  - 13 Jul 2024

Since the 1990s, Michael Ray Charles has become a widely recognised artist with a pioneering approach to investigating African-American questions. He draws on his inexhaustible fund of energy and capacity to transcend linguistic, cultural and geographic boundaries to create visual archives that stand as a personal chronicle of an African-American history rooted in both terror and light, freedom and slavery, racism and humanity, guilt and responsibility. With Afrochemistry, Charles delicately juggles between idea and image to explore the way African-Americans are represented physically and the resulting moral prejudices. The figures depicted in close-up radiate a feeling of depth and truth that has the disconcertingly powerful effect of questioning our perceptions and emotional connection with others. The features Charles gives the faces, as expressive as they are static, not only offer an examination of sensitive social issues but also serve as a catalyst for social change in modern-day America.Born in 1967 in Lafayette, Louisiana, USA, Michael Ray Charles currently lives and works in Austin, Texas, USA, and Gent, Belgium.

He is a leading figure on the African contemporary art scene. In the 1990s, he swapped canvas and brushes for needle and thread as fabric developed into his favourite medium. His work combines Western modernism with African symbolism, addressing social and political issues such as religious fanaticism and social justice with a complex and shimmering palette that has become his signature over the years.The Soul of Signs exhibition covers the gallery walls in majestic hand-embroidered canvases. The artist creates them using offcuts of African Bazin fabric which he dyes then rearranges in entrancing shaded tones, from fiery red to midnight blue, emerald green to golden yellow. ""Nature is an endless source of colour inspiration to me,"" explains the artist. ""A butterfly, a bird, a chameleon or a starry sky inspire me every day to come up with new pigments.""Konaté uses fine thread to embroider mysterious linguistic symbols on his multi-hued canvases. He finds the symbols during his travels, on the rim of 16th-century Tunisian ceramics, for instance, or at the heart of Berber art museums. “These marks have their own soul because they bear within them the heritage of a culture,” explains the artist. “Today’s generations have a duty to ensure that not everything is forgotten, to make use of these keys to our past and adapt them to contemporary society.”Born in 1953 in Diré, Mali, Konaté lives and works in Bamako. He is a visual artist and major figure on the contemporary art scene of his country and the African continent. After graduating from the Institut National des Arts of Bamako in 1976, he studied at the Instituto Superior de Arte in Havana, Cuba, from 1978 to 1985. He headed the Exhibitions Division at the Musée National du Mali from 1985 to 1997 before taking charge of the Palais de la Culture in Bamako and Rencontres Photographiques de Bamako from 1998 to 2002. He then took up the post of head of the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers Multimédia ""Balla Fasseké Kouyaté"" in Bamako, Mali.

The fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and his discovery of the West led him to choose a career as an artist. He has since built an exuberant and engaged art practice on what was both a historical and personal upheaval.The series of oils on canvas with their shimmering colours, almost unbearably vivid, are rooted in the socialist realism of his childhood as well as the codes of contemporary hedonism. Ludology is based on the work of Dutch historian and cultural theorist Johan Huizinga, who contrasts Homo Faber, rational and focused on progress, with Homo Ludens, a being governed by the characteristics of play. Ludology is Bisky’s interpretation of play philosophy, lifting the curtain on the ambiguity of a society obsessed with perfection and idleness.Each painting can be understood in two different ways: is the troop of boys in protective overalls the sign of coming catastrophe or a nod to a fetishist performance? Is the clown who keeps tight hold of a bouquet of balloons going to a birthday party or playing the main part in a horror film? Does the plane wreck testify to a war zone or is it part of the decor at a desert rave party?At the heart of the gallery, several large pieces of a puzzle made of plywood and painted on both sides are arranged as an installation symbolising this double-edged narrative. What Bisky does here, including with the style and pictorial codes of the work, is to link the radical subjectivity of expressionism to the idealised realism of propaganda art and the glossy aesthetics of advertising. He also draws an explicit link between the urban world and lush tropical nature, pornography and political activism. “More and more in my work I play with signs and symbols, which have become key elements of my art over the last decade,” he explains. “I create a dialogue between them and arrange them in my new collages so they represent an ambivalent vision of the world around us, permanently swinging between utopia and disenchantment.”Norbert Bisky was born in 1970 in Leipzig, Germany. His treatment of landscapes and exploration of the portrait and narrative structure place him firmly in the tradition of great European painting. But Norbert Bisky's experiments with breaking down forms and with blocks of colour also place him on the borderline of abstract art. His figurative style of painting, conjuring up the socialist realism he experienced as a child in GDR, suggests both hedonism and chaos in its contemporary form.",Norbert Bisky: LUDOLOGY,"293 Tenth Avenue, NY 10001",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 2 May  - 22 Jun 2024

The Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange (ROCI), pronounced ‘Rocky’ after the artist’s pet turtle, foregrounds his conviction in art as a force for positive social change, along with the role of travel as a key catalyst for his characteristically experimental approach to materials and techniques.Spanning the entirety of the seven years of ROCI’s intense creative production, the exhibition at Thaddaeus Ropac London encompasses canvases, sculptures, cardboard works, neon light, photogravures and textiles, as well as an example of the artist’s earliest metal paintings. Presenting works directly from the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, this is the first gallery survey dedicated to ROCI since the conclusion of the project in 1991. The ROCI works, many of which are also shown publicly for the first time since the project ended, are contextualised with archival materials. A selection of the artist’s black-and-white photographs, taken as source material during his travels and used for the silkscreen images in the ROCI works, are also included. Together, these elements offer an unprecedented overview of one of the most ambitious and wide-reaching artistic interchanges of the late-20th century.I feel strong in my belief, based on my varied and widely traveled collaborations, that a one-to-one contact through art contains potent peaceful powers and is the most non-elitist way to share exotic and common information, seducing us into creative mutual understandings for the benefit of all. — Robert Rauschenberg, 1984Acutely aware of contemporary global tensions, Rauschenberg sought to realise a large-scale touring exhibition primarily in countries where access to contemporary Western art and freedom of artistic expression was limited or non-existent. Almost entirely funded by the artist, ROCI ultimately travelled to 10 countries outside of the United States: Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, China, Tibet, Japan, Cuba, the Soviet Union, Germany (Berlin) and Malaysia, concluding in the U.S. with the exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.Working with a small team, Rauschenberg undertook a research trip to each participating country ahead of the corresponding leg of the exhibition to visit sites of interest and meet with local artists, artisans and prominent cultural figures. He then returned to his studio in Captiva, Florida, where he translated his experiences into a new body of work, which was subsequently exhibited alongside the touring retrospective of the artist’s work and a selection of ROCI pieces from the previous countries. Each iteration of the exhibition consequently facilitated a dialogue between the participating countries through the works assembled, while simultaneously offering an overview of Rauschenberg’s practice to audiences who may have had little or no exposure to contemporary Western art.I couldn’t see clearly as an artist until I understood that it wasn’t the similarities that were important, it wasn’t the similarities that pulled things together, but it was the differences that made things interesting. — Robert Rauschenberg, 1986Meaningful contact with other cultures was an enduring source of inspiration for Rauschenberg throughout his career. He travelled internationally with artist Cy Twombly in the early 1950s and then again as a set and costume designer for the Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s world tour in 1964. He created a series of paper works with the artisans at an ancient Chinese paper mill in 1982. These travels and previous collaborations found expression in his artworks, which feature his pioneering experiments with materials and techniques and continue to inspire new generations of artists working today. It was in the course of his ROCI research trip to Chile that he began working on copper as a sign of solidarity with the Chilean people. The Copperhead-Bites / ROCI CHILE (1985) fuse artistic innovation with the artist’s desire to reflect the socio-political conditions of the people he encountered, many of whom worked in copper mines during the oppressive regime of dictator Augosto Pinochet. At the same time, the artist was cultivating his own artistic evolution, resulting in the production of 15 metal painting series over the following decade.Elsewhere in the exhibition, Rauschenberg’s use of materials gestures to continuity within his practice. For ROCI VENEZUELA he integrated three-dimensional found objects onto supports silkscreened with photographic imagery. Recalling his earlier Combines (1954–64), they blur the traditional boundaries between painting and sculpture, image and object. This non-hierarchical approach also finds expression in the ROCI TIBET sculptures assembled from everyday objects – chairs, a typewriter and a fire hydrant – as well as the cardboard boxes unfolded and arranged in a modernist cubic formation for ROCI MEXICO. In turn, hanging fabric works created for ROCI USSR recall the unstretched textile supports used for Rauschenberg’s solvent transfer images in the Hoarfrosts (1974–76) and the sewn fabric Jammers (1975–76), the latter inspired by a trip to a textile centre in Ahmedabad, India.ROCI also marked the artist’s return to direct silkscreening, a technique he had rarely used in painting since the early 1960s. While his earlier screenprinted paintings feature images taken from mass media, the ROCI works rely solely on his own photographs, which were primarily taken during ROCI research trips. Cropping, enlarging and colouring these images with ink, Rauschenberg layered them in complex compositions to draw unexpected resonances that reflect his own unique impression of the cultures and environments he encountered. Often juxtaposing these mechanically-reproduced images with hand-applied elements, such as splashes of acrylic paint and corrosives that bit into the metal supports, he further mediated the documentary material through his own artistic intervention.Art is educating, provocative, and enlightening even when first not understood. The very creative confusion stimulates curiosity and growth, leading to trust and tolerance. To share our intimate eccentricities proudly will bring us all closer. — Robert Rauschenberg, 1984At the conclusion of the ROCI project, Rauschenberg had created more than 125 paintings, sculptures and editioned objects and over two million visitors worldwide had seen a ROCI exhibition. In several of the countries he visited, ROCI was the first solo exhibition by a contemporary Western artist. Rauschenberg’s creative vision had a critical impact on a new global generation of artists, with many in China still referring to eras as ‘before-and-after Rauschenberg’.Presented in London at another moment of deep global uncertainty, this exhibition revisits ROCI to consider the power of international collaboration and cultural exchange in the 21st century. The exhibition is accompanied by an illustrated catalogue featuring an interview with contemporary artist Alvaro Barrington.I see the legacy of ROCI in part being the ability to look at other cultures, look at other countries, look at other people, and find your common humanity, and that’s what I would hope that people take away from viewing the works and the spirit of the project. — Julia Blaut, Senior Director of Curatorial Affairs at the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, New York.",Robert Rauschenberg: ROCI,"Ely House, 37 Dover Street, W1S 4NJ",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 24 Apr  - 15 Jun 2024  
"Thaddaeus Ropac, Marais",Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/sean-scully-carbon-and-air/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Sean Scully,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/sean-scully/,"This exhibition follows Scully’s recent solo presentation at Houghton Hall, Norfolk, UK, in which his drawings were presented in conversation with his paintings and sculptures. Carbon and Air will run concurrently with a solo presentation of the artist’s work at the Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest, on view until 1 September 2024, featuring several works on paper from the same series, three of which have recently entered the Hungarian National Gallery’s collection. In 2023, Scully began a new series of works in which he reimagines some of the most recognisable compositional motifs of his paintings in pencil on paper. From the densely arranged rectangular forms found in his Wall of Light series to the stacked horizontal structures of his Landline works, these familiar shapes, which are always rooted in the forms he finds in the real world, reemerge in the exhibition through intricate, meditative hatching and shading. One of the first artists to break free of the rigidity of Minimalism, Scully led the transition to a more emotional, impassioned form of abstraction, in which composition is defined by his acutely experienced impressions of the world around him. As such, the recent drawings on view are each named after the date of their making.Though known for his use of colour, monochrome also holds an important place in Scully’s palette. Born in Dublin, Ireland, his family moved when he was four years old to the grey, industrial outskirts of London. In 1975, when he arrived in New York, he began what he has called a ‘five-year love affair with Minimalism’, inspired by the city to reduce his palette back down to these same monochromes in his Black paintings. The pencil drawings on view serve as a reminder of the artist’s relationship to high Minimalism through their formal self-sufficiency, while demonstrating Scully’s masterly ability to convey light in black and white through meticulous shading, creating, as Dávid Fehér, curator of the exhibition at the Hungarian National Gallery, writes, ‘colour without colour’. Like in the drawings of Georges Seurat, an important reference for Scully, densely filled space contrasts with sparser areas in which the individual strokes of his pencil are visible to form compositional structures guided by tone rather than line. The remarkable range he finds within monochrome, meanwhile, is profoundly influenced by the force of ‘the dialectical, or the grey’ in Giorgio Morandi’s work. In some of the drawings on view, the subtle application of blue, purple or red pencil introduces touches of colour.Scully has been working with the geometric grids and blocks that are the ancestors of the works on view since the late 1960s while still a student at Newcastle University in England. However, the exhibition also presents a small selection of figurative drawings from the early 1960s – before the artist entered art school and while he was still working as a typesetter’s apprentice – in which can be found the same attunement to light and dark, portrayed through shading rather than through colour, as is found in the artist’s mature and abstract compositions. In one 1964 work, a pensive figure emerges from a sombre ground created through the application of heavy pencil strokes, the physicality of which is palpable in the finished work. In another drawing from the same decade, delicate, swirling shading forms shadows on the floor in a sun-bathed domestic scene.Drawing has accompanied Scully’s practice as a painter since the beginning of his career, and his works on paper, as Joanna Kleinberg and Brett Littmen, curators of the itinerant 2012–13 survey of Scully’s drawings which concluded at The Drawing Center, New York, wrote, ‘both paraphrase and diversify the ideas in his canvases’. Conceived as a development or extension of existing motifs – as ‘stripping the motifs bare’, as Dávid Fehér writes – rather than as studies or preliminary sketches for his paintings, the artist’s drawings turn the often implied hierarchical relationship between the two mediums on its head. Harnessing the intimacy of drawing, Scully brings his familiar typologies of work to their purest conclusion to portray the essence at the heart of the compositions he returns to again and again. About the artistBorn in Dublin, then raised in London, Scully studied at Croydon School of Art from 1965 as a mature student, and then Newcastle University from 1968, where he began experimenting with abstraction. During a trip to Morocco in 1969, he was strongly influenced by the rich colours of the region, which he translated into the broad horizontal stripes and deep earth tones that characterise his mature style. Following fellowships in 1972 and 1975 at Harvard University, he permanently relocated to New York. From 1980, he made the first of several influential trips to Mexico. The experience had a decisive effect on him and prompted his decision to move from Minimalism to a more emotional and humanistic form of abstraction. It was while in Mexico working in watercolour in 1984 that he made the first Wall of Light, inspired by the patterns of light and shadows he saw on the stacked stones of ancient walls, but it was not until 14 years later, in 1998, following additional trips to Mexico, that Scully began to create his landmark Wall of Light series. These works were shown in 2005–07 at The Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.; Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas; Cincinnati Art Museum, Ohio; and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. In recent years, Scully has also increasingly turned to sculpture, creating monumental structures that engage with the unique energy and history of their locations. As in his paintings, these sculptures feature individual rectangular sections that slot together, maintaining his ongoing interest in interlocking brick forms.Scully’s work has been exhibited in prestigious institutions worldwide, including the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Paris; Museo de Arte Moderno, Mexico City; Museum of Modern Art, New York; National Gallery, London; National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin; Philadelphia Museum of Art; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh; Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.; and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, among others. In 2015 he was the first Western artist to receive a major retrospective at the Shanghai Himalayas Museum and at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing. An exhibition of Scully’s sculptures, paintings and drawings took place at Houghton Hall in Norfolk, UK, in 2023. Solo presentations of the artist’s work are currently on view at the Ludwig Museum, Koblenz, Germany, until 16 June 2024; and at the Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest, until 1 September 2024. From 21 June 2024, monumental works by Scully will be on view in the Église Saint-Nicolas, Caen, France, as part of the Normandie Impressioniste festival, and from 22 June 2024, Château d'Oiron, Plaine-et-Vallées, France will be exhibiting the artist’s sculpture, painting and works on paper.

"Thaddaeus Ropac, Pantin",Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/alex-katz-60-years-of-printmaking/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Alex Katz,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/alex-katz/,"This comprehensive survey of Katz’s printmaking is bookended by defining early prints that shaped the development of the artist’s practice and by arresting works made within the last year that demonstrate his continuing desire to innovate more than six decades into his career. One of the works on view, Luna Park 1, was the very first print Katz made with a print house in 1965. The artist had begun experimenting sporadically with printmaking in the 1950s, making etchings, linoleum cuts and stencils, before abandoning the medium for a decade, only to return to it in the 1960s, when the Pop Art movement, to which Katz was an important precursor and contributor, was broadening definitions of artmaking to include mechanical reproduction and rendering techniques. As Katz puts it, ‘there was a place in the world for prints’.Since 1965, printmaking has continuously held an important place at the heart of Katz’s practice, and reveals a more collected, measured side to his artmaking. In his canvases painted from life, often en plein air, in the manner of the Impressionists, he is known for his ability to encapsulate his fleeting impression of a scene through quick, syncopated brushwork and a wet-on-wet technique, where the entire composition must be finished before the first layer has time to dry. The process of making a print, on the other hand, requires more intention and calculation, making for compositions that the artist describes as more ‘stabilised’ than his paintings. As such, printmaking has often served, for the artist, as a means to develop, refine and reflect on the motifs in his paintings.The works in the exhibition represent familiar imagery from across key facets of his practice, from closely cropped, cinematic portraits to glinting seascapes and leafy landscapes depicted with defined horizon lines and an extraordinary economy of means. Over the course of the artist’s career, printmaking has also served as a springboard for encountering new technical challenges and, by confronting them, achieving new results. His early experiments in silkscreening, which harnessed the medium’s predisposition to a crisp articulation of forms through two-dimensional expanses of single colours, influenced Katz’s use of planes of flat colour atop monochrome backgrounds in his paintings, which have become characteristic of his style.From the mid-1960s onwards, Katz increasingly portrayed groups of figures from the social world that surrounded him in New York. Among the works on view is an important grouping of portfolios made across the course of the 1970s and 80s and into the 90s, which bear witness to his friendships and long-time collaborations with second-generation New York School artists, poets, choreographers and dancers. The portfolios function like vignettes, both in the graphic sense, with Katz experimenting with ways to dissimulate the hard edges of his aquatints like Francisco Goya before him, and the narrative sense, representing momentary observations of the people around him and demonstrating the artist’s lifelong devotion to depicting scenes of vernacular contemporary American life.Although widely known for his use of colour, Katz began printing in black and white in the early 1970s, a practice he has continued until the present day. Several of the most recent works in the exhibition testify to the importance of monochrome in his printmaking practice. Monumental black and white silkscreens and linoleum cuts from over the course of the last decade depict figures in high contrast, several of them inspired by crowds of shoppers. Hung on end walls, these works play on the visitor’s sightlines to surround them on all sides with faces as if in a bustling crowd, a sensation amplified by the stand-alone cutout figures that punctuate the exhibition. Katz first began making cutouts in 1959 as a way to restructure the relationship between figure and background. Suspended between painting and sculpture, they exist on a two-dimensional plane, epitomising the artist’s characteristic flat aesthetic, but occupy the exhibition in three dimensions, lending it a sense of depth and movement and encouraging visitors to interrogate the way they perceive works of art in space.",Alex Katz: 60 Years of Printmaking,"69 avenue Général Leclerc, 93500",Tue-Sat 10am-7pm, 25 May  - 23 Jul 2024

He has produced more than fifty films and videos, a dozen books and countless installations of photographic material, all sharing an interest in writing histories and the search for records and objects, keeping track of their changing hands, the retrieval of narratives and missing links that have been hidden, misplaced, lost, found, buried or excavated. The act of digging itself has become emblematic of his practice while acting to restore connections lost over time, or due to war and displacement. Zaatari has dedicated a large volume of his work to the research and study of photographic practices in the Arab world and has made uncompromising contributions to the wider discourse on preservation and archival practice.Rooted in this research practice, Zaatari’s exhibition in Naples retraces the element of restitution in the artist’s work, expressed mainly through text, documents and photographs that revisit descriptions and recreate objects or ties that once existed but are now lost. The exhibition features works across many media from the last two decades, beginning with his two-hour-long video, Ain el Mir (2002), in which the artist looks for a buried letter that never reached its destination. It spans through to Zaatari’s most recent body of work, Father and Son (2024), in which the sarcophagi of two Phoenician Kings (father and son), separated since antiquity, are reunited. The project is accompanied by a series of new works on paper that look at the Mediterranean as a locus of exchange, extraction and movement across millennia.Amongst these works Archeology (2017), Photographic Currency (2019) and Venus of Beirut, (2022), and a new work, Ibrahim and the Cat, For Inji Efflatoun (2024), all engage in the process of recreating objects that have either vanished or were never produced. The brass relief Ibrahim and the Cat – made with artisans in Naples – gives new form to a forgotten photograph taken by the father of Egyptian artist Inji Efflatoun for the purpose of making a painting that was never produced.Zaatari's idea of ‘giving life to things that do not exist in the present’ also applies to the recreation of a stone monolith used to seal King Tabnit’s tomb, which was completely destroyed when his sarcophagus was extracted in 1887. All that Refuses to Vanish (2022) was made from drawings and notes left by Ottoman statesman and painter Osman Hamdi during his excavation of the Sidon Necropolis.Akram Zaatari lives and works in Beirut, Lebanon.

In her daily life, she opens herself up to communing with and closely observing the environment: the texture of lichen, a stream of water, a glimmer of moths, or the old-growth maple trees that grow beside her Vermont home. With a remarkable sensitivity to space, she beholds nature deeply, entering meditative states of unwavering attention. She sketches en plein air before returning to the studio to translate her impressions to the canvas using sustainable oil sticks. Blending her medium with her fingers, she takes a tactile, almost sculptural approach to pigment application, ensuring an uninterrupted connection between her mind and the canvas.Though her sketches involve careful observation, Pozanti doesn't seek to replicate the natural world. Rather, she aims to capture the world as she encounters it-as a sensate, dreaming, interpretive subject. As a result, her landscapes breathe with life. The painting A Dream Strayed Into Light (all works 2024), for example, features a gauzy path lined with ecstatic, jewel-toned flora, all seemingly uplifted by a gust of wind. In The Shimmering Shoulders of the World, an ambient beachscape at twilight is viewed through a fringe of undulating branches. Lips to Breathe Her Name centres on a limber flower whose petals recall feminine anatomy.“My paintings are love letters to the Earth,” the artist explains. “I make them to celebrate, remember, and immortalise the beauty of the natural world… As I exist within the world, everything in it exists within me. This feeling of oneness and the urgency to embrace it blossoms in my work.” Beneath the enchantment that characterises these paintings, however, there is an element of melancholy. By emphasising our indivisibility from nature and revelling in its beauty, Pozanti hopes to inspire care for our environment and for all that is nonhuman in our world.",Hayal Pozanti: Tender Mountain,"15 Bolton Street, W1J 8BG","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 25 Apr  - 2 Jun 2024

Working on thick grain linen with raw pigment in a distinct palette of vermillion, lilac, raw sienna, and ochre, she renders her scenes with a fluid painterly freedom that is nevertheless quiet and precise in its effect. Across her work, she recalls aspects of the Symbolist ethos, which moved between nostalgia and rupture, seeking not to capture something directly, but rather convey the sensations it produces.In her new paintings, Longe focuses on the nude. Articulated in spare, suggestive gestures, her subjects, largely women, are pictured huddled together, embracing a lover, or striding alone. Some set their gaze on an unknown distance, others stare down the viewer, and one confronts a fish. Each seems possessed by a disquieting tension that is emphasized by a shadowy apparition lurking in many of the works. Masculine in stature, the incubus perches over a scene or cradles another figure therein. Where Longe’s previous series reflect on social dynamics, depicting parties and crowds, these paintings are more personal; the artist explains that the new works look inward rather than outward. Expressive, brushy marks bring subtle notions of agitation, dreaminess, and intimacy to otherwise minimal passages of color.These paintings further explore the ideas set out in Longe’s earliest work, which emerged from her study of classical portraiture at Charles H. Cecil Studios in Florence; in her early canvases, Longe integrated and recontextualized themes and styles of old-master paintings. Here, her compositions draw from Secessionist painter Otto Friedrich’s nudes and Symbolist Ferdinand Hodler’s ominous portraits. They likewise reveal the influence of a recent trip to Oslo, where Longe was taken by Henrik Sorensen’s mural (1938–50) in Oslo City Hall (where the Nobel Peace Prize is selected), and the marginalia of illuminated manuscripts. Ushering these disparate sources and traditions into her singular aesthetic, Longe poses subtle questions about representation—who it serves, and what narratives it upholds—just as she underscores figuration’s expressive potential.",Sahara Longe: Sugar,"74 Leonard Street, NY 10013","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 2 May  - 15 Jun 2024

Kang’s practice centers on the exploration of tension, boundaries, and balance. Her paintings and sculptures negotiate a harmony between old and new, reinterpreting traditional art forms like Jeongganbo and Chunaengmu in contemporary contexts. (1) References to the four seasons, works evoking sound and movement, and the balancing of near and far views create a sense of wholeness and inevitability, asking viewers to find peace and presence in the here and now.On view in the gallery are works from Kang’s celebrated series Jeong, Mat, Narrow Meadow, and Mora, as well as two new sculpture series, Mountain and Column. For each of these bodies of work, she has developed a distinct formal vocabulary that combines traditional techniques with specific materials to create dynamic forms inspired by Korean culture yet deeply engaged with contemporary social issues and art history. Rooted in her training as a traditional painter, Kang’s works explore how, despite our many differences, we remain connected. In focusing on how ideas of the past manifest today, Kang employs the traditional concept of “Jinkyung,” or “true-view,” painting, which seeks to represent the essence of the subject through the principle of shared symbolism. In this way, her work frames what she describes as “the beautiful moment of sharing time,” assisting us in being present in a space where “we can constantly reconcile imbalances and conflicts and achieve complete harmony with each other.”* Quoted in Connie Butler, “The Subtle Smile: Suki Seokyeong Kang’s Sympathetic Object,” in Willow Drum Oriole (Seoul: Leeum Museum of Art, 2023). All quotes by the artist are from this exhibition catalogue.(1) Jeongganbo is a type of musical notation dating back to the Joseon dynasty, in which the duration and pitch of sounds are notated within a square grid shaped like the character “Jeong” (井).

Greenhouse Trellising (mixed media, paper, mounted on canvas, 2023) is rendered from a photograph of Nyandoro. Inspired by botanical illustrations, this large-scale drawing with three-dimensional forms depicts the trellised plants and their fruits to reimagine the color, texture and condition of the plant and fruit forms. Chicken Run Setup (mixed media, paper, mounted on canvas, 2023) reflects the exponential rise of small-scale poultry rearing. Pfumvudza/Maize-cob Steelers (ink, paper mounted on wood panel, 2021) depicts a grower harvesting maize.At the juncture between the Upper and Lower Galleries is the work, Corner Glenara and Nelson Mandela Hustle (mixed media, paper, mounted on canvas, 2023), capturing the vendor activity around the intersections of Glenara and Nelson that connects the highway from Zimbabwe to Mozambique. The artist looks at the colors, forms and movement of the vendors with their goods which almost look like regalia.In the Lower Gallery, Locked Chill (paper and ink on wood panel, 2021) and Panorama (mixed media, paper mounted on canvas, 2023) draw together the polarities of movement between the enforced pandemic lockdown restrictions to curb spreading of the coronavirus and depicts Nyandoro's Uncle who became stranded. Panorama captures a lone 'spirit' figure onboard a fishing boat looking through a telescope for a missing population - an allegory that attests to the reported 84% (Population and Housing Census, 2022, ZIMSTAT, 2023) of the population that left Zimbabwe to look for employment elsewhere.Commerce is another focus present in the space.

Tucci Russo Chambres,Turin,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/alfredo-pirri-fare-spazio/,,Alfredo Pirri,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/alfredo-pirri/,"The gallery’s three rooms display recent works divided into two main groups.The first, entitled Compagni e Angeli (‘Comrades and Angels’), in the entrance hall, consists of a series of 32 watercolours on paper dedicated to Antonio Gramsci. The artist created these between 2022 and 2023, in parallel with the work on a large public and permanent installation dedicated to the statesman commissioned by the Apulia Region. This set of pictorial and spatial works originates from some passages taken from Gramsci’s letters, one in particular in which he speaks of the state of the prisoner: «... In the third year, the mass of latent stimuli that everyone brings with them from freedom and active life begins to die out and what remains is that glimmer of will, which manifests itself in the reverie of unrealised grandiose plans: the prisoner lies on his back in his bunk and passes the time by spitting at the ceiling, dreaming of things that cannot be realised0. This I will certainly not do, because I hardly ever spit and also because the ceiling is too high...! » (1).On the bottom of each of these watercolours, with their vivid and sometimes metallic colours, is a reproduction of one of the covers of the notebooks that Antonio Gramsci wrote during his imprisonment in the Turi prison, printed digitally and in a format faithful to the original. The regular shapes, imprinted in watercolour on the photographic reproductions (mainly using the pad technique), allude to geometries that seem to compose and decompose before our eyes to be captured in ‘real time’, which fixes them in a pose momentarily frozen in its visible form but ready to change configuration. Within the space of the sheet, they create magnetic tensions produced by the colours that allude to architectures imagined by the free and luminous meditation of Gramsci locked up in his cell. The coloured bands are painted freely over or alongside reproductions of these notebook covers from the early 1930s, dialoguing with them both chromatically and geometrically. The covers are split between some distinguished by the seriousness of dull monochrome colours, others characterised by a mimetic reference to precious materials such as crocodile skin, and many distinguished by imaginary and exotic architectures from those distant worlds that Italy would shortly invade and try to conquer. The guiding spirit of these works therefore consists in conceiving a ‘tribute’ to the thinking of Antonio Gramsci not in a static or rhetorical manner but by highlighting that luminous way of thinking that made him a champion of freedom and one of the constant references of our civilised living.On display together with this collection is the sculpture/model of the monumental work of the same title Compagni e Angeli (‘Comrades and Angels’) that the artist created in Bari within the building housing the Polo bibliotecario Regionale Pugliese in the former Rossani barracks.The second group, exhibited in the third room, consists of five large works made with mixed techniques: watercolour on Arches paper mounted on aluminium, Plexiglas with metal inclusions, acrylic paints and varnished wooden frames. These works, unlike the first group, are more monochromatic.Their colours, originally bright and primary, are modified and muted through the constant addition of a medium grey, a neutral hue that dilutes the luminosity and brings the dominant tone back towards an indistinct and hazy atmosphere. It is as if the works were not so much shrouded in mist or vapour, but rather painted directly from these ‘materials’ that impregnate the paper backing and from which emerge circular shapes like waves of sound or water that expand in space with a heavy sound.They appear to be the natural development of the works already shown by the artist at the Gallery in Torre Pellice (Alfredo Pirri, ‘Motore’, 2019) where there was a series of watercolours that rendered the same motion of circles that extend into space dynamically through the expansive use of colour. In the works on display in the exhibition, circular inserts of pastel-coloured Plexiglas are superimposed over these dynamic surfaces, sometimes enriched (and embellished) with metallic brass or copper straws that shine on the greyish backgrounds. As if they were celestial bodies caught in their moment of greatest splendour, on the borderline between appearing and disappearing, or poetic and dreamy phrases shining with reflected light. «... for a year now, cosmic phenomena have interested me (perhaps the bed, as they say in my country, is aligned with the earth’s fluids and when I rest, the cells of the organism rotate in unison with the whole universe) ... I have been waiting with great anxiety for the summer solstice and now that the earth bows (in truth, it straightens up after bowing) towards the sun, I am happier (the question is linked with the light they bring in the evening and there’s the earth’s fluid for you! ); the cycle of the seasons, linked to the solstices and equinoxes, is something I feel as flesh of my flesh... » (2)Finally, in the smallest room, at the centre of the larger ones, tensions are decanted by hosting a solitary work, created with transparent and reflective colours applied on a Plexiglas surface that is also transparent. The work radiates into the empty space through the pure energy of colour. A solitary work for a room as silent as a chapel... or a cell.1 - Antonio Gramsci, letter 11 July 1929 to his sister-in-law Tania2 - Ibidem",Alfredo Pirri: Fare spazio,"Via Davide Bertolotti 2, 10121","Wed-Sat 11am-1pm, 3pm-7pm", 21 Mar  - 27 Jul 2024

Pegah’s bouquets center around the iconographic “crown imperial” – a flower native to the mountainous region stretching from Turkey to the Himalayan foothills. Through the flower, which comes to symbolize a distant and imaginary homeland, the viewer is invited to explore the topics of hybrid identity and diasporic experience.Viewers are pulled into the front room of the gallery by a backdrop of deep-blue walls and yellow bars. In this first space a fictional short film introduces them to Roya, a London-born painter and bus driver with Iranian heritage. Through her character, playing the role of the artist of the impossible bouquets, the viewer learns about the dissonance between diasporic imaginary and reality.In the central room of the gallery, visitors are engulfed in further interpretations of the still life, ranging from a multiperspective diptych to isolated deconstructions and a contemporary reinterpretation of the bouquet. The painted works are accompanied by selected film stills oscillating between the urban context of London and the natural hillscapes of Iran, adding interpretative tension to the circumstances under which the floral arrangements were produced historically and today.Pegah Keshmirshekan is a promising artist, who displays conceptual depth and masterful technique in her oeuvre of painting, film and photography.

Choudhury (The Courtauld Institute of Art, London) with assistant curator Kelsey Corbett (Unit), the exhibition brings together 19 modern and contemporary Afro-diasporic artists. As a mode of survival, errantry infers fugitivity as well as improvisation.The poetics of errantry offers a counter-discourse about Black cultural production, raising critical questions: how has errantry been employed aesthetically and politically as a form of Black dissent? How do incidental encounters of the itinerant or the arbitrary inform technical and formal innovations, as well as other artistic freedoms? How do the terms of disobedience and waywardness figure in the art of the Black diaspora?Newly commissioned works by Stacey Gillian Abe, Winston Branch, Jonathan Lyndon Chase, Rachel Jones, Hilda Kortei, Sola Olulode, Anya Paintsil, and Charmaine Watkiss will be on view alongside works by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Romare Bearden, Phoebe Boswell, Adelaide Damoah, Paul Dash, Miranda Forrester, Claudette Johnson, Keith Piper, Hank Willis Thomas, and Joy Yamusangie. The exhibition also presents a site-specific sound installation by Trevor Mathison (Dubmorphology and Black Audio Film Collective).If “Foreigners Everywhere”, the theme of the 2024 Venice Biennale, emphasises a multiplicity of ethnicities, genders, and nationalities, all in service of what the curator Adriano Pederosa calls a “celebration of the foreign, the distant, the outsider, the queer, as well as the indigenous”, In Praise of Black Errantry explores the significance of wandering beyond national borders or the limits of exile in celebration of artists who are, themselves, challenging conventional discourses.On view from 17 April–29 June the exhibition will be in the Palazzo Pisani S. Marina, a 15th-century palace located in the Cannaregio area of Venice and depicted in a Renaissance painting by Jacopo de’ Barbari. The palazzo previously hosted the Diaspora Pavilion in 2017 and the Croatia National Pavilion in 2015. In Praise of Black Errantry will mark Unit’s first presentation during the Venice Biennale, as part of the gallery’s commitment to research-led initiatives that nurture artists and contribute to contemporary cultural discourse beyond conventional programming structures.

Demonstrating a shift in the artist’s practice towards group portraits and sculpture, Normal Life does not only consider our relationship to our own emotions but explores our connection to society and its changes more broadly.Kim’s lifelong fascination with portraiture stems from his past career in photography, reflecting a motivation to arrest ephemerality. However, the figures in Kim’s paintings remain deliberately obscure. Devoid of idiosyncrasies, these people could be anyone. For Kim, ‘emotionless characters’ mirror the hidden side of modern society, becoming projections of the more difficult thoughts and feelings that we strive to push away. The artist is particularly interested in the singular anxiety that has grown from our rapidly developing technological age.While we simultaneously expose and mask our true selves online, we retreat from the physical world to digital spheres. This sense of isolation is reflected in Kim’s portraits in which figures either appear alone or are presented together with minimal interaction.In many paintings, figures in sombre clothing appear next to sepia counterparts. Perhaps these monochrome people reflect the internal struggle between inward and outward emotion, becoming visualisations of the thoughts and feelings we try to repress. Kim observes that many of us do not show our sadness or anxiety, hiding these negative feelings from wider society. As such, these monochrome figures seem to convey the protective mental shields with which we surround ourselves.The sculptures, new to the artist’s practice, also demonstrate what Kim defines as the ‘veiled story’ that lives inside us all. These sculptures even appear in the paintings themselves. In one image, a figure is about to hurl a sculpted bust across the picture plane, perhaps alluding to an increased resistance to honest emotion.These ideas eventually give way to a more positive outlook. In Kim’s preferred painting of the exhibition, Untitled (Trust), a figure falls through mid-air, seemingly reaching out for support. Another figure, a later addition by the artist, appears at the bottom of the frame with arms outstretched to brace the fall. Kim hints at ideas of companionship, reminding us that we are not always alone. In the end, the artist insists that these works are never based on fully formed thoughts. Rather, Normal Life reflects the vacillations of his experience and the internal monologue that weaves through his mind every day.",Heesoo Kim: Normal Life,"3 Hanover Square, W1S 1HD","Mon-Sat 10am-7pm, Sun 12-6pm", 29 May  - 3 Jul 2024

Softened through the inclusion of fabrics and wallpapers, Olson has created a total environment that is both tactile and womb-like. Viewers seem to inhabit the paintings themselves, as the artist draws us further and further into this enclosed world.Olson has always been drawn to cave environments, viewing them as theatrical landscapes onto which various ideas can be projected. Childhood memories of visits to caverns or play areas built to mimic caves inform his vision of these underground grottos that seem at once organic and simulated. In Grotto Domestic, Olson thinks particularly about time and leisure, pondering what we do when we have too much of both.In this exhibition, the artist conjures a vague image of a post-work or post-scarcity world. These cave-like spaces seemingly offer endless time as, free from societal pressures, creatures simply lounge around or become absorbed by electronic screens. The underground worlds simultaneously evoke a sense of luxury and isolation. Olson plays with a juxtaposition between streamlined modernism and seclusion, forcing viewers to question whether these are spaces of relaxation or traps that inhibit interaction with the outside world.",Jeremy Olson: Grotto Domestic,"3 Hanover Square, W1S 1HD","Mon-Sat 10am-7pm, Sun 12-6pm", 29 May  - 3 Jul 2024

Throughout history, figures as diverse as MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE and INGMAR BERGMAN have sought out their solitude on a voluntarily basis. Perhaps their persistent appeal for privacy triggers our own curiosity and imagination. That is to say, that we are presented with a closed door separating us, on the outside, with them on the inside. What were they up to, really?This pursuit of time alone, with the aim of indulging in laziness, pleasure or intellectual stimulation, is the red thread running through present exhibition. Each work, in its own way, forms a visual expression of this longing to make a ‘French exit’ - or to discreetly retreat from one’s social context.Two private drawings by SERGEI EISENTEIN are joined by one of ARMAND DORÉ’s bohemian femme fatales.

This is another way in which its unexpected rediscovery in Winstanley's paintings gradually seems more fitting the longer one looks. What else these older paintings - made by artists from their own different cultural contexts - have in common is their curious relationship to the complex act of seeing. This was, in a sense, Winstanley's great project as a painter. His works have always taken as their subject the architecture and rhetoric of looking. Placement, perspective and colour - the tools with which illusionist Western painting builds its virtual realities - become for Winstanley a means of thinking about how painting and the world do or do not come together.

Throughout their careers, both regarded the impulse to paint as being intrinsic to their broader creative drive, an embodied painting informed by and informing their accomplishments as choreographers and performers.On view across the two spaces of our London gallery, these exhibitions consider for the first time the siblings as painters in parallel. Created in New York from the late-1970s into the 2000s, selected works by Geoffrey move from the quiet intimacy of domestic scenes to the lively energy of nightclubs. Equally tender and strong, these paintings display his deeply intuitive understanding of colour, used powerfully to describe emotion as much as form. Works by Boscoe are drawn principally from the 1990s, made in Trinidad where he resettled in 1970. A focus of these paintings, characterised by their quiet intensity, is the male nude, a significant aspect of Boscoe’s work though one that was rarely exhibited during his lifetime.Together the exhibitions draw connections and invite conversations around expression, representation and style, the similarities and contrasts of brothers who, sharing creative passions, remained distinct though equally compelling characters throughout their lives.New writing by Trinidad-born writer Attillah Springer accompanies the exhibitions.The Geoffrey Holder exhibition is presented in collaboration with James Fuentes and the Geoffrey Holder Estate.The Boscoe Holder exhibition is presented with thanks to Christian Holder, Executor of the Boscoe Holder Estate.About the artistsA painter, designer, dancer, choreographer and musician, Boscoe Holder (1921–2007) was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. A child prodigy, he began painting seriously and playing the piano professionally from a young age. He later formed his own dance company, the Boscoe Holder Dancers, and in 1947 visited New York for the first time, teaching dance at the prestigious Katherine Dunham School of Dance and exhibiting his paintings. Returning to Trinidad the following year, he married his leading dancer, Sheila Clarke. In 1950 they travelled to London, which was to become their home for the next twenty years. They formed the dance troupe Boscoe Holder and his Caribbean Dancers, performing at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Holder spent the next two decades touring Europe and further afield. Later in the 1950s he produced, choreographed and costumed shows at the Candlelight Room at The May Fair Hotel, where he also formed and led his own band. Film and television roles during this time included Sapphire and The Saint. He continued to paint throughout this period, exhibiting his work at venues including the Redfern Gallery, the Commonwealth Institute, the Royal Watercolour Society Galleries and the Leicester Galleries.Holder returned to Trinidad in 1970, where he focused on painting until his death in 2007. He showed regularly in Trinidad and throughout the Caribbean. In 1973, in recognition of his contribution to the Arts, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago awarded him the Hummingbird Medal (gold) and named a street after him. He also received awards for his achievements from the governments of Venezuela and France, as well as various institutions in the US. Posthumous presentations of his work include the group exhibitions: In the Company of Alice at Victoria Miro, London, UK, in 2010andSelf-Consciousness, curated by Hilton Als and Peter Doig, at VeneKlasen/Werner, Berlin, Germany, in 2010. A new book, Boscoe Holder: Travels in Rhythm, A life of art and dance by his son Christian Holder is published by Rosenstiels in spring this year.Geoffrey Holder (born 1930, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago; died 2014, New York, USA) was a painter, photographer, choreographer, director, costume designer, dancer, actor and composer. Following the lead of his older brother, Boscoe, Geoffrey made his debut appearance with the Boscoe Holder Dancers at the age of seven. In 1953, invited by choreographer Agnes de Mille, he relocated to New York City, where from 1955–1956 he performed as a principal dancer for the Metropolitan Opera Ballet before embarking on a career in film, which included roles in Doctor Dolittle and the Bond movie Live and Let Die, and later television. His first solo exhibition in New York was held in 1954. By 1956 his work as a painter was recognised with a Guggenheim Fellowship. In New York, Holder found a muse in his wife-to-be, the distinguished dancer, actress, and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade. The couple married in 1955, travelling the world – including a period spent in Paris working with Josephine Baker – eventually settling in Lower Manhattan. During the 1970s Holder won two Tony Awards for his direction and costume design for the Broadway musical The Wiz and received multiple awards for his direction, costume design, and choreography.Solo exhibitions have been held at venues including James Fuentes (2024: curated by Erica Moiah James, Los Angeles, USA; 2022: Pleasures of the Flesh, curated by Hilton Als, New York, USA); New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, USA; Mexican Cultural Institute, Washington, DC, USA; National Arts Club, New York, USA; Far Gallery, New York, USA; Griffin Gallery, New York, USA; and Randolph Gallery, Houston, USA, among others.

Sze will take over the gallery with a new moving-image installation and present a suite of new paintings in surroundings that bring the mise-en-scène of Sze’s New York studio to a nearby Venetian apartment, uncannily evoking a sense that the artist has just stepped away from her place of work.Sze’s latest video work transforms the gallery with an array of ever-changing projections suspended throughout the space. Carefully composed, the projections invite the viewer to visually navigate the work, forming a personal narrative by journeying from one image to the next. Interested in shattering the singularity of an image, and in dismantling any hierarchy of visual material, Sze’s installation questions the nature of looking and underscores how images are fundamental to memory.On view in the salon rooms of an apartment opposite the gallery, Sze creates a total environment with a series of paintings presented within a simulation of the space in which they were made. Again considering the perception of images, Sze’s enquiry is one of orientation: how does one locate oneself in a painting, and how can a painting’s effect be one of disorientation? Compositionally complex, the works incorporate both art historical strategies and digital techniques. These are paintings that reward the act of looking: the eye is always engaged in a process of putting the paintings together and taking them apart.A sense of discovery and indulging the pleasure of being lost rather than arriving at a destination has informed all of Sze’s oeuvre, and the experience of Venice as a place, its unique invitation to wander, is echoed within the exhibition. All of the works on view incorporate imagery – even if layered and hidden – that Sze has captured or created in the city.About the artistFor the past thirty years, Sarah Sze has developed a singular visual language that challenges the static nature of art with a dynamic body of work spanning sculpture, painting, drawing, printmaking, video, and installation.Born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1969, Sze lives and works in New York. Sze represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 2013 and was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2003. The artist has exhibited in museums worldwide, and her works are held in the permanent collections of prominent institutions, including Tate, UK; M+ Museum, Hong Kong; MUDAM, Luxembourg; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; the Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.

Waddington Custot,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/beyond-surrealism/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",,,"Emerging as a transformative force from the avant-garde roots of Dada in the early 1920s, Surrealism evolved as one of the most influential artistic movements of the 20th century. Spreading internationally, it came to represent, above all, an art of juxtaposition and the coalescence of disparate elements with a witty or dreamlike logic. ‘La carmagnole’, a 1927 painting by Max Ernst (1891–1976) depicting an otherworldly scene populated by dancing, distorted figures, illustrates the Surrealists’ belief in metamorphosis and transformation. These fantastical elements are picked up by Lucas Samaras (1936–2024) in his Photofictions, a series of hallucinatory self-portraits and psychedelic compositions that conjure enigmatic scenes, while the amorphous sculptures of Barry Flanagan (1941–2009) blur the boundaries between human and animal, reality and fantasy. The bodily form and texture of Flanagan’s ‘The Voyager’, 1984, eerily echo the figures in Ernst’s painting.Often employing symbols and hidden meanings, the work of the Surrealists articulated profound messages and emotions. Bill Woodrow’s (b.1948) unexpected combinations in ‘Half King, Whole Fish’, 1988 and ‘Clockswarm’, 2001 have the viewer scramble for concealed messages, while the playfully disturbing paintings of John Wesley (1928–2022) combine seemingly unrelated objects to create a sense of irrationality and surprise. An important reference point here is the relationship of image and object considered by René Magritte’s (1898–1867) painting ‘The Treachery of Images’, 1929, often referred to colloquially as ‘Ceci n’est pas une pipe’, today residing in the LACMA collection. Patrick Caulfield’s (1936–2005) great admiration for Magritte is revealed mostly clearly through ‘Night Pipe’, 1992, its titular subject matter a direct reference to Magritte’s masterpiece, and ‘Evening Paper’, 1999, which exemplifies the artists’ shared interest in the eeriness of empty interior spaces.Giorgio de Chirico (1888–1978) also uses spatial dislocation to create mysterious scenes that prompt viewers to scrutinise the boundaries between reality and the imagination. ‘Piazza d’Italia’, 1960, a typically disquieting piazza painting, with classical arches, perspective and angled light, is paired with paintings by Allan D’Arcangelo (1930–1998) and Mimmo Paladino (b.1948). D’Arcangelo’s ‘Landscape with Three Trees’, 1968 defies conventional perspective and lighting, whilst Paladino’s enigmatic sculptures draw on mythology and architectural elements to resonate on a deep psychological level.Jean (Hans) Arp (1886–1966) was interested in exploring the subconscious mind. He employed chance – arranging pre-cut biomorphic forms where they fell – to create ‘automatic collages’. These organic forms are echoed in the sculptures of Paul Feeley (1910–1966) and David Annesley (b.1936), who in the 1960s termed himself a ‘neo-Surrealist’, because for him ‘abstraction’ meant to abstract from the figure. The fluid, curvilinear forms that populate the paintings of Landon Metz (b.1985), made with a free-flowing dye that charts its own path, continue this Surrealist interest in automatism into the 21st century.‘Beyond Surrealism’ affirms the enduring potency of Surrealism to kindle the imagination of the creative mind. While these artists did not term themselves Surrealist and could not be termed as such, this exhibition explores the ways in which the artistic practices they pursued were made in part possible by the Surrealist artists that came before them.",Beyond Surrealism,"11 Cork Street, W1S 3LT","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 29 Apr  - 15 Jun 2024

Embodying a poignant sense of transience and reflection, her paintings navigate an ambiguous territory between abstraction and figuration, shifting between the sentimental and melancholic, the uncanny and strange. Lancaster’s recent body of work depicts anonymous women set within pastoral landscapes, as part of her ongoing engagement with archival and discarded ephemera she sources from online auction sites, flea markets and junk shops. While rooted in a longer lineage of artists pushing the psychological boundaries of figurative painting, she is interested in subverting the gendered nature of this art history. Divorced from their specific context and time, Lancaster’s subject matter appears like a dreamlike vision taken from a shared consciousness, where figures reveal themselves to the viewer, both haunting and alluring, creating a sense of connection between the lives of the lost and the nameless - and our own. In this new body of work, Lancaster delves further into the physicality of her materials, refocusing and transforming how paint and image interact with one another. The works explore the interplay of liminal space, and the physical aspect of the paint becoming an entry way for illusion. The result of which is work that is transcient, with figures that ebb and flow as if through a distant memory or a fleeting dream.

Split across the gallery’s upper and lower floors, taking the form of two distinct installations, Drift presents viewers with a spellbinding view of the visual rhythms that constitute the ebb and flow of various cityscapes. Through painting and photography; etching, silkscreen print and slide projection, Stawarska reveals how one fashions a personal relationship to place―layering histories of memory and movement, absence and restitution via patterns that wrap horizontally and vertically across the gallery walls.About the exhibitionDrift builds upon Stawarska’s signature artistic approach―of self-exploring cities, allowing herself to get lost, only to return―a practice akin to that of flaneur. Often accompanied on these journeys with discreet recording equipment; the recordings are adapted, shared with select listeners, annotated, and re-exposed to the world in multi-layered form, revealing the contradictions within the geo-politics of a given urban sphere. What exists in the interstices? This process of revelation is what Stawarska calls the act of “inner listening”.On the ground floor, Stawarska presents works that are largely inspired by the maritime hues, the abundant humidity, and air of a coastal city that evokes memories of an Andalucía. Here, dreams unfold as a horizontal line, in various shades of blue, green and lilac extends across the four walls of the gallery, punctuated by large paintings and small monochrome prints. A triptych, Found Boat, Lost Memory - New Iteration, 2024, hand painted over a silkscreen print, leans against the longest wall. Playing with scale and placement, Stawarska invites the viewer weave and observe from multiple sightlines as their eyes linger across long stretches of coloured paper to small, postcard-like images. Pause for breath, and look up, and one will find paper cascading from the ceiling to the floor―agile, robust, permanent.Speaking of Stawarska’s work, the artist, author and curator, Dr. Omar Kholeif, Senior Curator and Director of Collections, Sharjah Art Foundation, recently noted, “Everything that I know about paper I learned from Magda. I have spent years trailing in her footsteps―in print rooms and dark rooms, and back into print rooms through to installing onto gallery walls. What I have learned is that the paper presents a kind of boundless possibility―it listens, feels, responds, unlike any other medium”.An abandoned fishing boat, Some Boats Wait Forever 2024 sits in juxtaposition to the tiny photo-etchings of fishing baskets, which serve as both as vessels of confinement and protection.This play with multiple cityscapes continues downstairs. The film, which visually takes place in Łódź and sonically in Bologna and Pisa, revolves around a paired conversation with the painting of torn tarpaulin in Venice. This scene interleaves with a slide projection of shop carts and stalls, wrapped in fabric on a city street in Sharjah, UAE. Deploying her aforementioned process of ‘inner listening’.Stawarska invited local researcher and architect, Souraya Kreidieh, to examine a soundscape composition without detailed context, but for a series of prompts for annotations. These evocations are looped into slides forming a tapestry that tessellates and refracts as the clicking sound of the looping slide carousel, echo the call and response of two voices reading fragments of Gertrude Stein’s Ida, a restless traveller, who also enjoys the privilege of rest.Opening hours during London Gallery Weekend: 31 May and 1 June: 11pm - 6pm, 2 June: noon - 5pmMagda Stawarska (b. Poland, lives and works in Preston)Magda Stawarska’s multi-disciplinary practice combines moving image, sound, traditionally made silkscreen prints and paintings on paper. She examines how rhythms in sound affect our ability to decode the visual; how the process of what she describes as “inner listening” and intimate listening to a soundscape of place impacts the ability to understand one’s personal relationship to a city, and how the trauma of loss, passed from one generation to another, translates to the architecture within a city.Stawarska was recently the subject of a two-person exhibition, 'Plaited Time / Deep Water' along with Lubaina Himid, curated by Dr. Omar Kholeif at Sharjah Art Foundation (2023) travelling to MUDAM, Luxembourg in 2024. Stawarska’s recent group presentations include, 'A Fine Toothed Comb', curated by Himid, HOME, Manchester; 'Rewinding Internationalism', Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven and Villa Arson, Nice (2023); 'INVISIBLE NARRATIVES: New Conversations about Time and Place', Newlyn Art Gallery, Penzance, (2019), 4th International Biennale of Casablanca, Morocco (2018); 'Sounds Like Her' curated by Christine Eyene, New Art Exchange, Nottingham, York Art Gallery, York, and Gallery Oldham, Oldham (2017-2020).In 2020 'Bracka 40' was purchased by the Arts Council Art Collection.

Inspired by the light of Provence in contrast to the dark weather of her home base in Chicago, Letinsky began a series she titled Who Loves the Sun in which she used natural light together with artificial light to provide her images with a radiant glow. Her subjects included borrowed objects such as a ceramic vase and glassware from La Maison that may have belonged to Maar. The detritus left behind from other artists-in-residence, as well as flowers and weeds growing nearby also found their way into her images. Yet, her photographs are not necessarily about what objects appear within them but rather about the medium of photography itself.Letinsky explains, “I make pictures of very ordinary things in a way that destabilizes and questions the camera’s authority while also indulging in its sexiness, solicitating a visual pleasure that is tethered to other senses.” Letinsky complicates the singular point of view of the camera by building frames within frames and precariously positioning objects in relation to one another. In reference to her innovative picture spaces, Letinsky notes, “Cezanne’s still lifes described objects from multiple perspectives so as to refer to perception being a constantly shifting process. I try to harness this, to articulate that we’ve two eyes and are ambulant living beings.”Through her work, Letinsky questions what is necessary to make a photograph that is considered “good.” Dissonance and interruption are components of her language in which objects’ perspectival positions are abstracted and gravity is elided. By working with objects associated with the home, she makes images that evoke tenderness and project an uneasy and fragile beauty.The exhibition title, For, and because of... refers to the incommensurability of things, suggesting that there is not a concrete metric by which to measure or to reckon with life events. Letinsky notes, “So the show, the work, is for, and because of the wars, because you never called me back, for the rain that watered my garden, because the train was late, for my sons, because flowers bloom…”Laura Letinsky (born 1962, Winnipeg, Canada) received her BFA from the University of Manitoba in 1986, and MFA from Yale University’s School of Art in 1991. Her work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, New York; J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; The Denver Art Museum; The Photographers Gallery, London; and Mumbai Photography Festival, India. Public collections featuring Letinsky’s work include the Art Institute of Chicago; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Museum of Fine Art, Houston; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Yale University Art Gallery; and Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography.Letinsky has received numerous awards, including the Canada Council International Residency (2014); Richard Driehaus Foundation Award (2003); Anonymous Was a Woman Award (2002); and the Guggenheim Fellowship Award (2000).

Deliberately subverting traditional photographic representation, the images in Midnight Swim explore time, memory and experience in nature as subjects, combining past and present in a multi-faceted approach. Graf’s work conveys his experience of nature as both ecstatic and entropic, with vegetation decaying and blossoming simultaneously.The exhibition presents photographs from two of Graf’s ongoing series, Hallucinations and Telepathic Jungle. Made with a 4x5 large format camera, the Hallucinations photographs record multiple exposures of a canopy of wisteria taken over a summer day as the light changed. Planted at his childhood home the summer he was born, the forty-year-old wisteria vine has functioned as both a touchstone and metaphor for Graf throughout much of his career. Placing colored gels over the camera lens to accentuate a tone, a sense of the day or a particular association with a mood or memory, Graf explains, “The chromatic vapor of memory is constantly swirling; these stand as testaments to the layered sensations of being engulfed in that canopy, which still feels as magical and sublime as when I was a kid.”Telepathic Jungle arose from years of experimentation with the photographic medium and its materials. Inspired by a single photograph of invasive vines growing over maple trees, Graf created a weaving maze of nature in all its unruly and merciless beauty. Exposing the negative to multiple flashes in the darkroom along with color gel filters, he then developed the large print in a handmade wooden trough, agitating the paper to create drips and visual stutters flecked across the paper. A second unique photogram is Midnight Swim, an image taken of crashing waves illuminated by a full moon. Combining seawater with photographic developer, Graf poured the mixture over the print while exposing the image onto the paper. A swirl of ultramarine blue, deep green and dark umber hues activate the image keeping it in constant motion, imbuing breath and life into the artist’s memory of the experience.Born in 1982, Bryan Graf received an MFA from Yale University in 2008 and a BFA from the Art Institute of Boston in 2005. His work has been exhibited at the George Eastman Museum, Rochester, New York; Institute of Contemporary Art, Portland, Maine; and DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park, Lincoln, Massachusetts. Graf was the recipient of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (2015) and the Maine Arts Commission Project Grant (2019). He is the subject of several monographs: Wildlife Analysis (Conveyor Arts, 2013); Moving Across the Interior (ICA@MECA, 2014); Prismatic Tracks (Conveyor Arts, 2014); Broken Lattice (Conveyor Arts, 2015); and Debris of the Days (Conveyor Arts, 2018).
