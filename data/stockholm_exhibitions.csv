This latest work process has progressed slowly and it has unfolded in just a few rooms, mainly in my studio and on the glass veranda of our house, but also in an old basement space beneath the bank office in Kivik, where a small gym has been set up. Being of advanced age, I go there every week in the hope of staving off death a little longer. On Sundays, I go with a friend. Over the past years, she has only a few times asked me about the progress in the studio. She knows it’s a sensitive topic and she doesn’t want to intrude. During one such rare inquiry, I found myself saying that this exhibition is dedicated to my daughters. I don’t often talk about my work, but sometimes, in a brief exchange like this, it can be clarifying to hear my own thoughts.On Thursdays, I go to the gym alone. When I’m there by myself, I occasionally get ideas for new works. They come as small and light rewards, but then take considerable time to execute. While the practical work in the studio is underway, I enjoy filling my mind with thoughts. For example, I can easily recall my father, the girls’ grandfather. He fell ill and unfortunately passed away a year or so after turning sixty. So, he was around the age I am now. He probably made peace with his fate, but I remember him being worried about me. I had a psychosis a few years earlier, and I think he feared I might fall ill again. Moreover, I was now pursuing a career as an artist. How would I manage? ”I’m sure it will be fine”, I reassured him one evening while turning on the news. That particular evening, there was a segment about careers and future prospects. It turned out that the absolute best combination at that time was to be a man and to educate oneself to become a doctor. The worst-case scenario was being a woman, choosing a career as an artist. Since my father was a doctor and I had just changed path to become an artist, the situation was quite hilarious, and we laughed for a long time. It was liberating for both of us.I belong to the frightened lot. Before school age, I didn’t really perceive myself that way. I mostly sat at home, drawing by the kitchen table, while my mother tinkered with her own crafts beside me. She provided me with pieces of cardboard and paper, and I got new colourful crayons as soon as the old ones ran out. I felt safe and encouraged. It wasn’t until I started school that my existence was shaken, and I was filled with a strong unease that I couldn’t quite put my finger on. School was supposed to be so much fun, but my voice faltered when I tried to speak in the classroom. I withdrew to avoid revealing to others how scared I was. One morning, the teacher handed out a blank sheet of white cardboard and a new box of pastel crayons to each of us, along with an instruction to draw whatever we wanted. I immediately got to work in the same way as I did at home, and soon I had drawn a large princess filling my entire sheet. She had black hair, a crown and a magnificent dress in three tiers. Red lips and rosy cheeks, ball fringe trims and ribbons. I had given her everything. She was absolutely radiant. ”You draw so beautifully”, the girl in the next bench suddenly exclaimed, standing up to get a better look. Soon, more curious classmates came forward wanting to see as well. They did not say much, but I distinctly felt that this language was helpful and empowering to me. And the children around my bench had seen with their own eyes that one should never disregard a wallflower.I work on my art in intervals. A work effort lasts a few years and is followed by a long pause. Restarting the artistic process often feels difficult and somewhat repulsive. Everything that could go wrong and all the hours of work awaiting. The doubts. Will I manage? When the work starts to flow, the safe feeling from the kitchen where I sat and drew beside my mother often returns, and the confidence I managed to muster to give life and form to the princess. It’s as if I find my way to a deep and life-giving extra breath. The unconscious probably guides me, but on the surface, thoughts flow freely as my hands gently shape the material. A piece of wood, a bit of fabric or a string of yarn.More than thirty years have passed since I sat and laughed on the couch with my dear father. He might have died again if he could see how well everything has worked out for me. Richard still by my side, three lovely daughters, a beautiful house and a studio with a stunning view. Established as an artist, but perhaps most importantly for him, a mental state without further concern. Except for still being fearful. Maybe I wouldn’t have been able to convince him regarding my art. Perhaps he would have muttered something about not understanding. But the exhibition, opening here, doesn’t primarily aim to appeal to the since long departed, and the artworks in it are not to appear as questions or answers. It’s a song I want to sing.A love song.For my girls.–Mette BjörnbergMette Björnberg was born 1963 in Gothenburg, Sweden, lives and works in Södra Mellby, Sweden.
