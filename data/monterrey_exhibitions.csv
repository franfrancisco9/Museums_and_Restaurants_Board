By uncovering these vulnerabilities, the artists invite us to reflect on our imperfections and how they shape our relationships. The visual landscape fluctuates between intimate and isolating moments, charged with atmospheric intensity.Through an alluring dialogue of opposing perspectives, the artists examine profound themes of the human experience, including gender, identity, and the intricate relationship between the body and its environment. Inspired by the duality of the essential self and the physical world, the exhibition provides a profound exploration of the inherent complexities of existence. Drawing upon modernist influences, the work boldly challenges conventional norms and perceptions, offering a fleeting glimpse into a realm intertwined with our deepest psychological vulnerabilities.The featured characters challenge conventional notions of beauty, existing beyond societal norms and free from the constraints of traditional perspectives. While surreal, each artwork encapsulates a utopian ideal that transcends societal expectations. By defying gendered assumptions and societal conventions, the individuals depicted find a sense of freedom, authentically existing within a realm of boundless possibilities. Yet, amidst this liberation, a subtle unease lingers, hinting at the inherent imperfections and complexities that define our shared reality.This powerful exhibition reminds us that perfection is neither achievable nor desirable. By embracing our imperfections, we can forge genuine connections with others and cultivate empathy and mutual understanding. The featured artists challenge us to view vulnerability as a strength and to break down barriers to build more authentic relationships in our personal lives offering a poignant reflection on the complexities of human imperfection and vulnerability.Their work encourages viewers to confront and challenge their personal truths while also celebrating the appeal in embracing one's flaws. Beyond a mere exploration of art, this exhibition is a profound meditation on the human experience in an imperfect world.","MYSELF, WHEN I AM REAL","Lázaro Garza Ayala pte 436, San Pedro Centro Garza García, N.L., 66230",By Appointment, 4 Jun  - 7 Sep 2024  
MARCO,Monterrey,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/adeline-de-monseignat-enceinte/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Adeline de Monseignat,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/adeline-de-monseignat/,"The Seedscape installation is developed within the orographic limits that surround the city of Monterrey and is nourished by Monseignat's recent maternal experience. In this sense, the work suggests the protection of the uterus at various levels and from various perspectives. In the first instance, through exuberant native vegetation, the artist approaches sculptures related to the procreative female womb, which unfold into seeds containing life; from another place, these structures appear contained and limited by the walls of the museum's outer courtyard. In a broader vision, this landscape, in constant movement, is created concerning the five great mountain ranges surrounding the city, turning concatenated systems into the central disruptive axis of the proposal.The recurring selection of materials in Adeline's artistic practice, such as marble, gravel, and vegetation, seems to be discursively related to the vulnerability of the human body. Hence, the author has titled this exhibition under the French term Enceinte, which refers both to the action of ""bringing life inside the womb"" and to the space inside a container, in this case, directed towards the heart of the building. Finally, it is important to specify the synergies of layers that stand out in this project: the city, the museum, the sculpture garden, the vegetation, and the seeds – sculptural elements – seem to reinforce the feminist position of Monseignat, who makes this visual universe around human creation.- Taiyana Pimentel",Adeline de Monseignat: ENCEINTE,"Juan Zuazua, Padre Raymundo Jardón y, Centro, 64000",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 30 May  - 11 Aug 2024
