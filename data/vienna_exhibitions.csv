Galerie Eva Presenhuber Vienna,Vienna,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/josh-smith-studio-news/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Josh Smith,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/josh-smith/,"In 2019, just before the dawn of COVID, Smith was interviewed by Ross Simonini for ArtReview in his studio warehouse in New York City, a multi-level live-work space and library with a lettuce garden in the basement. Even before the lockdown began, Smith had been living in isolation for years, rarely leaving the house and avoiding interviews as he focused on paintings for a major exhibition in New York.Since the pandemic, Smith has emerged transformed as a new public persona. On Instagram, his presence suggests that he is an art-world ambassador, and on YouTube, he hosts an ongoing lo-fi series called Studio News, in which he discusses his artistic pursuits and sometimes nothing at all. It is ‘straight man’ comedy, sprinkled with revelations about his inner life, all mixed up. It is the kind of unblinking deadpan that often looks back at you from Smith’s paintings: a sincere satire.On the occasion of his new show Studio News at Galerie Eva Presenhuber in Vienna, Smith reached out Simonini and asked to do a second interview to follow up on their initial conversation and respond to its heavy, introspective tone.Ross Simonini Did you want to do a revised interview because your personality has changed since our first talk?Josh Smith Yes, I was in a dark place at that time, but not so much anymore.RS I feel like I can see that with your new use of Instagram and YouTube.JS It’s all been positive. I’ve met a lot of people, exposed myself to new opportunities, and have been able to play around with how people see me.RS Would you say that you post things for other people or yourself?JS Well both. It’s for anyone. I like archiving little things. I like the way the grid looks. How the platforms preserve the content. Often times I post things that I know people won’t particularly like. People want art but that’s not always what I can give. I want human stuff as well. I think of it all as an art project. It’s a new medium for me. It’s the same way I think about my paintings. I’m excited about YouTube now.RS You have a program called Studio News, which is sort of an ironic title.JS Because nothing happens in the studio.RS There is no news.JS Never.RS Do you enjoy being a public persona now?JS Fortunately, not too public. It makes me self-conscious but I like that feeling. Making art makes me feel self-conscious too.RS Showing or making?JS Making. In the studio I have anxiety about changing. I get turned off by the idea of doing the same thing over and over again. But it’s nerve wracking to change... You do that too, change what you make.RS I do. It’s tricky. People want you to stay the same, like a brand.JS If you want to change you have to lean into it. You have to hammer it hard. I don’t want to be an artist who makes the same thing over and over and this body of work illustrates another change.RS They feel new to me in many ways. Your images seem to dance across the canvas now. How do they feel new to you?JS I’m taking away the figure, ground relationship, the background and foreground. It’s all over. The stencils negate the expressionist qualities. I worked and hoped for this.RS But you are making the stencils.JS Yes, I cut them. I make them myself.RS Do you think about the word “pop”?JS Yes, sometimes. Most art is pop art now. It’s the kind of time we are in. Things are all on social media, which is pop. I want to make pop art, but I don’t want to do Warhol.RS The last show was all red paintings.JS Red is repulsive. It’s also alluring. During that time red was everywhere in my studio. And I left the stencils out of that show intentionally. It’s a power color, but I did it. Now I’m pushing against that. That’s what I do. Often, I am reacting against the past show or reacting to anything. This helps make my work feel alive.RS When did you make these paintings?JS I made these in the late fall, early winter... But I don’t understand what they mean.RS I’d never ask you that.JS I know you wouldn’t. I think they are somewhat self-portraits. They are collections of things around me. Collections. That could be a good title. That gives it value, or a way for them to connect.RS It’s like you’re building a vocabulary and then constructing sentences.JS It’s exactly that. That’s what I did. I used my vocabulary to make sentences.RS They’re simple, archetypal images. Most people have a relationship to these things.JS The ladder is something I painted in college because it’s neutral. And I love the eagle, the rope...all of it.RS Do you see this vocabulary as Halloween-y?RS My work does get Halloween-y sometimes. It’s what seems to happen. Maybe it is a search for an inner child. Not being such an adult about things.JS Do you plan your paintings?RS Not right now. A lot of times I don’t. I only want to paint. The stencils allow me to relish in that idea. When I would start these, I had the ingredients, but I didn’t know what I was making. This was a new way to work. I hope the viewer can clearly tell how the paintings were constructed.RS That seems generous, to allow people into the process. Do you think these paintings document the change in your personality?JS I hadn’t thought of it but the work is much more buoyant. It’s less heavy, especially compared to red paintings. Those felt menacing, toward me. These feel more open-ended. I try to make all my paintings open-ended. I come up with an idea and make it function. A lot of my ideas are terrible. Starting with a terrible idea is something that I find challenging. I appreciate the challenge. Maybe terrible is too harsh of a word, but I like working uphill.RS What percentage of your work makes it to exhibitions?JS It depends on what’s going on. On average, 50% of things that I start. I try different things out. I start in the dark and end in the light.RS Is it important that your paintings express how you feel?JS Yes. Ultimately, it’s about how honest I am with myself. For the most part, I am an expressionist. Whether I like it or not. But I don’t think many people will see the paintings like that. I hope people put their own feelings into a painting, rather than think of me.Ross Simonini is an artist, writer and composer living in Los Angeles.Josh Smith was born in 1976 in Okinawa, Japan (his father was in the military) and, after a number of relocations, grew up mostly in eastern Tennessee, US.

You, with your names!Every thing needs its name, you say, and you fail to realize that giving a name is always a form of taking.The name is brutal.It tears the thing out, roots and all, and moves it to another place. I know it only too well:Every name is a transplantation.Mum brings 1000 snails to heaven every day, she says. I think heaven is very big.In the watering can is poison for the snails. We are frugal and only have one.The forest is full of spruces like the garden with snails, both are not from here.The forest needs us humans, says the farmer and starts the chainsaw, it's a pity that the forest has had to live without us for so long.Shot 5 birds last week, all were ringed, starting to collect rings - am the only one with this hobby at the moment.Hammered 80 nails into the spruce, I wonder when it will die?That's the way it is.But I grow into your names and out of them.Where the names end, I begin to speak.(Text excerpt: Lea Wintterlin Quotes: Karl Karner)The biomorphic sculptures of Karl Karner in his new exhibition ""Fichtengrau"" at the Kandlhofer Gallery greet visitors in a larger-than-life and almost intimidating manner. Resembling fantastical-futuristic life forms (or landscapes?), these works, made of aluminum and bronze cast, exhibit finely branching structures and an organic surface, leaving behind a highly fragile impression.The reference to nature, particularly botany, is obvious, as the artist clearly names each work in relation to it. The resilient spruce serves as the namesake for Karner's nearly three-meter-high sculptures, titled ""Fichtengrau"" or ""Fichtengrün."" While evoking a clear image, the exhibited works only partially reflect this image in an altered form. Despite vaguely resembling dead trees in their vertical arrangement and barren appearance, the unconventional, almost bizarre forms of the sculptures immediately disrupt this clear image. They are based on concrete references from the animal and plant kingdom, such as mushrooms, branches, tree bark, or vineyard snails, which the artist combines into grotesque sculptural growths through casts. Additionally, fragmentary references to human intervention are hinted at when the individual elements are assembled into artistic assemblages. The idea of choreography becomes apparent when observing the sculptures.From a distance, the figurative silhouette of the objects initially comes to the forefront, only to reveal upon closer inspection a multitude of diverse organic forms, inevitably drawing the viewers' gaze into the depths of surreal landscape scenes. These are partly patinated and partly covered with clay slip by the artist. The result is an aesthetically homogeneous overall impression that almost gives the sculptures a classical appearance. From their observer position, humans gaze upon an artistic amalgam of our reality, distorted almost beyond recognition, frozen in the moment of its creation. Karner's reflections on the interplay between humans and nature seem to materialize in the sculptures: starting from the concrete motif of the spruce, which, as a particularly robust tree species in the 20th century, was predestined for reforesting forests, the full extent of human mismanagement of the past decades is vividly brought to light. In the face of climate change, tragically, the spruce is one of those tree species most severely affected by global warming.It is an observational glance at our present rather than a clear critique that Karner undertakes here – pessimism is foreign to the artist; rather, delicate signs of hope become discernible as individual shoots sprout from the underground of one of his sculptures. Karner has prepared the ground of specific works with seeds, the watering of which he personally undertakes.Consequently, during the exhibition period, the sculpture will undergo a metamorphosis that symbolizes the human potential to counteract the damage already done by showing mindfulness towards nature and not remaining indifferent.Text by Sergey HarutoonianAbout the artistKarl Karner (b.1973 in Feldbach, Austria) lives and works in Feldbach, Austria. Karner studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna under Professor Heimo Zobernig.Karner positions his work between the disciplines of visual arts, performance and dance theatre. Within his practice, Karner continuously discusses bodily perception and the concept of corporeality itself. These are not only related to the human body, but can yet be understood as a wide discussion of object, materiality and space. In the artist´s installations and art environments, viewers frequently become players. Such participative impulses accentuate the irony inherent in these artworks.",Karl Karner: fichtengrau,"Brucknerstrasse 4, 1040","Tue-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 11am-4pm", 12 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

Using photography and collage, works emerge through stages of exploration, materialising as three-dimensional structures. These monolithic forms, or geological artefacts, generate a new perspective on the passing of time and our appreciation of the landscape.Permanence of Space brings together a series of works that culminated from a trip to Carrara in Italy. This exhibition raises questions surrounding context and artistic intention. The artist’s work asks the viewer to be attentive to what is happening beneath the surface, our impact upon that natural world and how we appropriate it for our own purpose.Amy Stephens was born in London 1981, graduated 2005 at the University of Reading, BA (Hons) Fine Art and 2008 with an MA in Fine Art at Chelsea College of Art and Design, London.",Amy Stephens: Permanence of Space,"Brucknerstrasse 4, 1040","Tue-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 11am-4pm", 12 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

As Benjamin Buchloh aptly remarks, he pursued his studies as cultural studies, a method of artistic intervention—long before this trend in art became widely established.A New York Times critic once observed in consternation that Dan Graham, an Aries, made no distinction between Ludwig Wittgenstein and Britney Spears—even referencing their zodiac signs. And Sebastian Egenhofer states: “Graham's humor is an assent to the instability of the subject, whose masks are set up around an empty center, a lack, a hole (…).”The exhibition will be accompanied by a publication of significant texts by and about Dan Graham, focussing on his truly unlimited activities and influence in the field of art and culture, with texts by Ute Meta Bauer, Dieter Bogner, Sabine Breitwieser, Helmut Draxler, Sebastian Egenhofer, Zdenek Felix, Andrea Fraser, Kim Gordon, Dan Graham, Franziska Hausmaninger, Robin Hurst, Kasper König, Mieko Meguro, Christian Meyer and Jeff Wall.",Dan Graham – Optics and Humor,"Eschenbachgasse 9, A-1010","Tue-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 11am-3pm", 12 Apr  - 6 Jul 2024
