Almine Rech,Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/gwen-oneil-over-the-ridges-and-through-the-passes/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Gwen O’Neil,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/gwen-oneil/,"“Over the ridges and through the passes,” Gwen O’Neil’s first exhibition with Almine Rech presents a series of new paintings inspired by unique weather and light conditions endemic to southern California. Like many West Coast-based artists—notably those associated with the Light and Space movement such as Larry Bell, Mary Corse, and Dewain Valentine—O’Neil seeks to capture the combination of natural and artificial factors responsible for southern California’s dramatic environment. Acknowledging that the fiery sunsets and hazy glow associated with Los Angeles are largely the result of air pollution, O’Neil’s paintings are as foreboding as they are dazzling.Channeling painters like Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, O’Neil composes her compositions—typically swirls, curls and waves of intense and varied colors—out of individual daubs of paint. Placing different colors next to each other on the canvas (rather than mixing them on a palette), O’Neil creates hazy volumes that seem to pulsate as we fix on them. Up close, these abstractions, which she bases on natural forms ranging from the tiny spirals inside seashells to massive murmurations of birds, break down into individual marks, like a digital photograph disintegrating into pixels. A constant push and pull between micro and macro perspectives in O’Neil’s work keeps the viewer’s eye coming back to the surfaces of her canvas—as do seemingly errant touches of color that “pop,” instead of blending with the surrounding hues. Unexpected dashes of hot pink or chartreuse, for example, disrupt the illusion of distance or volume. The effect recalls similarly surprising painterly flourishes found in landscapes by Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh or even Joan Mitchell. Similar to the blazing, almost neon orange sun in Monet’s famous Impression Sunrise, 1872, certain aspects of O’Neil’s compositions seem intended to emphasize the materiality of paint itself.In addition to light effects, O’Neil has found inspiration in natural phenomena like starling murmurations and, most recently, the Santa Ana winds. Her paintings translate the dizzying patterns created by thousands of birds flying and swooping into colorful swirling compositions that communicate a sense of awe, but also danger. Stunning though they are, starlings are an invasive species. With this in mind, O’Neil’s paintings can be understood not only as appreciations of the birds’ incredible synchronized configurations, but also as a kind of alarm bell signaling a potential threat to the ecosystem.The works on view in Paris continue O’Neil’s exploration of California’s infamous Santa Ana winds, a likewise duplicitous marvel she has been painting since 2023. These strong winds are the bearer of beautiful clear skies and dry weather, but also have the potential to cause massive destruction. Warm, dry air creates prime conditions for forest fires, which is why Native American tribes have referred to these intense storms as “devil winds.” In addition wreaking havoc on the natural landscape, the Santa Anas are associated with all kinds of strange reactions in humans ranging from physical ailments, like headaches, to psychological ones, like depression and anxiety. In paintings like Canyon Vibrations and Mountain Pass (all works 2024), O’Neil captures both tangible and eerie effects of this force of nature.As an East Coast native who grew up between New York City and East Hampton, O’Neil initially worried she might find California’s lack of seasons perturbing. Indeed, fall foliage, winter snow, spring blooms and summer heatwaves, have been replaced with wildfires, flooding, and sea-level rise. With an acute awareness of her immediate surroundings, O’Neil has developed an artistic practice that documents and raises questions about the effects of human caused climate change on her own backyard. Resonating well beyond, her paintings are deceptively beautiful warnings about the precarity of our planet.— Mara Hoberman, art critic",Gwen O'Neil: Over the Ridges and through the Passes,"64 rue de Turenne, 75003",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 11 May  - 14 Jun 2024  
"Almine Rech, Matignon",Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/tom-wesselmann-monica-with-wesselmann/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Tom Wesselmann,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/tom-wesselmann/,"""At first, I thought of modeling for Tom as just a job. A starving artist, so to speak, coming to NYC needs some work to support her art, and I was lucky enough to land a job working as Tom Wesselmann’s model. That was the starting point, and it was amazing in itself. Later, I would become an assistant, mixing his paint, keeping his records, helping him manage his clients and his sales, singing his country songs, and being his friend. At first, it was not a steady job, being just the model, but later by adding in studio work, it became my permanent gig. And little did I know I was entering history.I am both a painter and a songwriter so when I started modelling for Tom I was used to having eyes on me, as a front singer in a rock band and modelling for art classes for my fellow artists. There is a kind of synergy that takes place in those situations. You are no longer just you. You are part of a whole experience. The ego subsides, presence appears, and transformation occurs. The other band members plus the audience become part of the whole process; the artist and model become collaborators. You enter into an honest dynamic that is bigger than you.When I met Tom Wesselmann, through my new friend and neighbor Candy Spilner, who was already working for Tom as his solo assistant, I knew that he was famous. But I was also in the limelight, albeit on a much smaller scale, playing shows at CBGB, Peppermint Lounge, Danceteria and all those cool NYC venues. I thought I had made it somehow. That is the innocence or maybe arrogance of youth.Because of the work I was doing, and my naïveté, I took to Tom as a fellow artist. And he let me in as though we were equals. I believe it was this casualness and his humility that made us comfortable together. I didn’t know enough to be intimidated, and he found no need to intimidate me. Looking back, I think he was even intrigued by this very nonchalance on my part. Looking back, I am embarrassed at my boldness.In the 80s Tom was having a renaissance along with a world that was changing. There was something in the air. We all knew it, but when you’re in it, it’s hard to see. NYC was reinventing itself and so was Tom.Tom was very clever as well as creative. He was excited and itching to incorporate his new idea – the development of the laser cut metal pieces. Something about me matched the process. He was already testing this new medium when I arrived on the scene. His wife and favorite model, Claire, was busy raising their children, so Tom was using various other models after her. But he was looking for someone longer lasting. Someone who would represent this new stage of his artistic vision. I became that person.Once, Tom told me that he would’ve met me whether Candy had introduced us or not. In his mind, it was fate.I would arrive at Tom’s studio, and he would hand down the key to me on a fishing pole through his window, knee bent, foot against the window casing, dressed in his khaki corduroys and blue work shirt, his consistent studio work clothes.I will never forget that place, 231 Bowery 2nd floor. It was recently demolished, and now it is only a memory. On the ground floor was Daroma, an Israeli company that sold restaurant equipment. But the building housed other artists, and Tom was on the second floor. After going through the outside industrial door, I would take a walk through the dark, dank, dusty hallway, walk up the steps and enter into the bright lights of a very busy artist’s loft. It was a dream to me, with the smell of oil paint, images everywhere, and an excited stillness. Tom’s everyday worktable that he would use for preparatory work was now set up as a model stand to the right next to the wall. When I first met Tom, I was only posing for portraits. He would ask me to move my mouth this way and that, tilt my head or smile, and he would draw and sometimes photograph my face. There were only a few drawings that came out of these.My real work came when he later asked me to model nude. I was reluctant at first, since we had become friends, so that seemed tricky, but I decided it might be a good job, one that I already knew how to do, and it could fuel my own creativity.So, I said yes, and we committed to our work as artist and model. It would last on and off for many years to come, pretty much until the end of his life.Tom had a Chinese robe for me to wear as I was preparing to model, one that he often used in his work. I never got over feeling nervous when I first took off this robe. There was a choice, either to become naked or to become sacred. I chose sacred, and Tom went along.This space that we entered is very hard to describe. It was charged with a kind of intense yet safe force, and we both sat in that field of intensity and worked. The constant was the flow of country music wafting in the background. The sessions were long, lasting his full workday, and they were tough for the model. There was hard work going on.Sometimes Tom would ask me what I was working on and we would start to talk about art or music. He always wanted to know where we were playing, what I was writing about, what I was painting, what I was doing, although he never came to the gigs. He never went anywhere. He worked and went home. Still, it seemed natural (in hindsight, amazing) that he was genuinely interested in my work. He honestly treated me as a fellow artist as I sat there with him, alone and vulnerable.Although these sessions started out animated, they became quite quiet by the end. And no matter what, I was aiming at making him succeed in his drawing. I was concentrating on that energy between us, trying to keep him interested in his work, drawing a body as though it were supernatural, something meaningful, worthwhile, more than it was. Something that would matter. We were both after something more than a nude woman as seen by a man. It was unspoken, but we both knew. This wasn’t going to be carnal; this would be magical. This would be art, and it would be something new and made in metal. All of this was exciting for him. And it was my job to keep it that way.A whole bunch of drawings would come out in one session. He would churn out maybe 15 drawings each time. I would have to invent four or more new poses for each sitting. And while I would be getting into place he would have a vague idea, recline, sit, or wear this necklace, or just move my arm up or down, head this way or that. I never brought a prop. If there were any other features, a hat or beads, they came from him. Tom was always kind and gentle to me during these sessions. He mostly would exclaim that he couldn’t capture the beauty. Although that was nice to hear, I wanted him to say, “Got it!” So, we kept working. He never said those words, but later on many of these drawings became major works.My time with Tom goes deeper than our work as artist and model. We laughed and painted and visited and sang songs. He was my boss and followed the boundaries, but I knew that he loved me. And I loved him as well. As an assistant he treated me as such, but as a person he thought of me as more than that. It was unspoken but felt.One thing is for sure. He loved that I was a singer. He loved that I wrote songs. That was where I was different, where I became an angel to him. I could sing.""— Monica Serra",Tom Wesselmann: Monica with Wesselmann,"18 avenue Matignon, 75008",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 7 Jun  - 20 Jul 2024

While inspired by these historic references, McCaw confronts the question of what a photograph is and what its elements – time, light, lenses, photo-sensitive paper – can be.Experimenting with large-format cameras and with various printing processes, Chris McCaw began building his own cameras in 1995. The artist equips his large-format cameras with powerful lenses typically used for military surveillance. Instead of film, McCaw inserts expired fiber-based gelatin silver photo paper directly into the camera. Pointing the lens at the sun, McCaw makes recordings ranging from thirty seconds to as long as 84 hours. The sun, intensified by the lens, scorches its path across the paper while creating a solarized image of the landscape or seascape below – a “direct positive” image made in-camera, without an intervening negative. Seeking to extend the duration of his photographs, McCaw has made four trips to the Arctic Circle in summer when the sun never sets to document the “midnight sun.” Throughout his work, these burned lines and holes are tangible traces of the act of making each photograph: marking time, recording location, mapping weather conditions and channeling light. The minimalist skylines or horizons, where visible, evoke for their part the transitory nature of the elements in the locales where McCaw chooses to photograph: the desert, the sea, or the mountains.Describing his work as being more of a collaboration between artist and subject, McCaw explains, ""… not only is the resulting image a representation of the subject photographed, but the subject, the sun, is an active participant in the printmaking… both creating and destroying the resulting photograph.""Born in 1971, McCaw’s work has been exhibited at institutions including the National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C.), the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston and the Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), the J. Paul Getty Museum (Los Angeles), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York), the Chrysler Art Museum, (Norfolk), the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C), the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington D.C), the Victoria & Albert Museum (London, UK), among many others. McCaw is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Andy Warhol Foundation's New Works Grant and Alternative Exposure Grant, as well as the Emerging Icon in Photography award from the George Eastman House. The artist lives and works in Pacifica, California.The exhibition is complemented by a book entitled ""Marking Time"", published by Datz Press.

The flattened-out, rotated, hieroglyph serves as a vehicle and support for everything else that makes the paintings paintings: color and gesture, speed and light, chaos and kitsch, etc.A cut-out acrobat becomes ensnared within the articulations of a rotating sign-apparatus, or perhaps leaps out and escapes. Almost a dance, almost an allegory. In the paintings, these two figures combine sometimes to form an abstract monster. Using a technique invented in Los Angeles by Albert Oehlen, Spaulings adheres these hybrid sign-creatures directly to the wall with rubber cement, like giant stickers.

It initiates processes of transformation and is transformative itself, which may at first appear counterintuitive to its static appearance. The passive, mute, and durable world of objects and physical matter that one encounters in her work becomes a place of dynamic processes and shapeshifting, where the stable appearance and order of things are profoundly transformed.

Continua,Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/yoan-capote-espinario/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Yoan Capote,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/yoan-capote/,"Taking an emotional approach to our world, the exhibition presents a selection of works exploring a variety of themes, but always linked to the artist’s socio-political reflections, such as migration and borders, the dialectic of life and death, control and freedom of expression. Essentially inspired by his personal experiences and their link with the social environment in which they are lived, Capote is constantly seeking to translate the complex emotional and psychological conflicts of the individual into the physical experience of his work.The name of the exhibition, ESPINARIO, comes from the small statue the “Spinario”, of a boy pulling a thorn from his foot, taken from a legend that inspired many artists from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. This type of statuary dates from the 1st century BC and depicts a young shepherd removing a thorn from his foot. The best-known example of this theme is on display in the Hall of the Triumphs in the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome. The singular, graceful pose of this figure, caught in an unusual gesture, made it one of the most admired and copied works of the Renaissance. With a vitally important message to deliver, the shepherd boy only stopped to pull the thorn from his foot once his mission had been accomplished. While the foot was a symbol of freedom and mobility in ancient traditions, the thorn embodied obstacles, limitations and pain.The use of this myth in Capote’s work follows the characteristic metaphor of the artist as messenger, and shows his own involvement in the transmission of our shared ideas and feelings. In this way, the artist takes on the pain of the world around him, expressing it through his art and relieving people of their pain.Many of the works in the exhibition are new, and are the result of a sensitive examination of contemporary human behaviour, affected by power structures, the fragmentation of the family sphere, conflicting ideologies, fake news and censorship. The artist’s use of precise symbolism is informed by an in-depth analysis of the various inner psychological conflicts we face, individually or collectively, in many parts of the world today.Capote is presenting a new series, Sentimientos Encontrados, based on electrocardiograms collected by the artist from various Cuban individuals, expressing the fragmentation of Cuban society caused by grief and frustration. The use of these techniques manifest the artist’s turn towards abstraction in his artistic language. Made from saw blades, the rhythms of which are based on heartbeats taken from the electrocardiograms of various people in Cuba, the work evokes different ways of feeling and thinking about reality.A similar creative process led to the development of Espinario (síndrome de Procusto), practically echoing the name of the exhibition itself. Based on a work created by the artist in 2003, in which he tried to graphically represent the sound of his voice when he uttered the word “ silence ”, Espinario develops in greater depth his work on the transcription of sound as a creative material. This time, the graphic shapes of the word “ freedom ”, pronounced by many different people, are assembled in a grid pattern to create an aggressive and sharp surface, similar to a bed of thorns. On the other hand, in Lacerante (Paisaje de nostalgia), the artist received the voice files of several Cuban migrants saying words about their experience. Words like: Exile, uprooting, exodus, sadness, farewell, nostalgia, exile, melancholy etc. All these words were cut in bronze with green patina and brown rust corten steel in the size of trees in a maquette. Then all together fixed on an old wooden create a forest.Purification (struggimento) (2024) is a work made specially for the exhibition. Throughout PURIFICATION series Capote recycles and reworks chains, barbed wire fencing, handcuffs, and other metal detritus into alternate shapes and dimensions, there are moments of deconstruction, tension, aggression, and control. All this work process is shown at the gallery in a video that documents the sequences of actions and that contents the most powerful meaning on the work.The new works in the exhibition are presented in dialogue with earlier works by Capote, such as Speechless (2019), Autorretrato (estudio de resistencia) (2019), Obediencia (2019), in which the artist, through the representation of different parts of the human body, dilute the representation of individual experience in a collective empathy, or a social allusion.About the artist:Yoan Capote was born in Pinar del Río, Cuba, in 1977. He graduated from the National School of Art in 1995 and from the Higher Institute of Art in Havana in 2001.He has received distinctions such as the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship (2006), the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Prize (2006) and the Vermont Study Center Fellowship (2002). At the 7th Havana Biennial (2000), he was awarded the UNESCO Prize, together with the DUPP artists’ collective. His work was part of the group exhibition at the Cuban Pavilion at the 54th Venice Biennale (2011) and at the Sydney Biennale (2022).

Her paintings, approached as landscapes, stem from layers of colors on panels commonly used in construction. She discovered this construction material by watching her father work and developed a desire to experiment with the material while subverting traditional painting on wooden panels. These “panels” are both solid and transformable, giving Barbana Bojadzi the freedom she seeks: she can reuse them by reclaiming construction waste or decide to rework her old works, creating a flow of permanent evolution.Barbana Bojadzi strives to capture an immediate perception of our world without having to interpret gestures, traces, and figures in time. Reflecting the inherent humility and simplicity of her work, her technique is rooted in the search for recurring patterns, which she will use and reinterpret. She draws inspiration from music, whether through simple themes sung repetitively in reform music or focused on experimentation and improvisation. She develops the same relationship with her paintings. The humble and common material used in her works is subjected to slow and repetitive gestures and to external “accidents” that the artist constantly integrates into her practice. Paint drips are incorporated into her compositions, and natural forces like the wind can influence the shape of the panels, sometimes breaking them and forcing the artist to reduce and rework them. Painting mostly outdoors, Barbana Bojadzi is forced to compose her works in the face of contingencies and to push her experimentation further.She views painting as the confrontation of different levels of language, leading her to use multiple layers of colors and materials, painting and “sculpting” the surface to reveal its stratifications. These landscapes are thus built and rebuilt over time, through additions or removals of material, to reveal their wounds, traces, and changes. To see Barbana Bojadzi’s works, one must be able to pause: to contemplate them, taking the time to observe every detail and corner, discerning a new detail, a new complexity.The edge of the work often reveals the color of the original material, allowing those who know it to identify it. By working on several works at once and almost constantly using already used panels, the artist gives free rein to her freedom. The works can thus be assembled like pieces of a puzzle or divided into several pieces, infinitely nourishing the artist’s creative process. Seeking to liberate and free her gesture, she goes as far as to create her own tools and instruments of work, to be constrained neither by the material nor by the elements with which she will transform it. Her artistic practice is therefore primarily a formal search for freedom.About the artist:Born in 1996, Barbana Bojadzi is an artist originally from Kosovo who currently lives and works in Provins, France. She graduated from the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 2021, with honors from the jury. At the Beaux-Arts, she was mentored by Dominique Gauthier, Nina Childress, and Dominique Figarella.In her artistic practice, Barbana Bojadzi is particularly interested in the memory associated to gesture, the idea of imprint, and its relation to Time. Her artworks are characterized by the accumulation of layers, colors, and textures, thus creating a stratification of meanings and materials, where the image emerges by a mechanism of extraction. Barbana Bojadzi is always seeking new technical processes, highlighting used and reclaimed materials that reflect the humility and simplicity we find in her work.Barbana Bojadzi recently won the Khalil de Chazournes Prize, awarded by the Amis des Beaux-Arts de Paris, as well as the 2023 Sisley Prize for young creation, and one of her works is now part of the Société Générale Art Collection. She was also part of many group shows, including “Société Générale Art Collection” at the Société Générale Tower, Puteaux (France), “Felicità” at POUSH, Aubervilliers (France).",Barbana Bojadzi: Ordered Fields,"87 rue du Temple, 75003",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 2 Apr  - 28 May 2024

After studying at the Académie des Beaux-Arts and a long spell as an illustrator, he chose the cultural vibrancy of Paris to pursue his investigation of perceptual-sensory dynamics.“The Euphoria of Colour” (“L’euphorie de la couleur”) presents the highlights of Carlos Cruz-Diez’s artistic career, exploring his theory of colour through some of his most emblematic works.The landmark works Fisicromía 54 and Fisicromía 55 (1962) and Objeto rítmico móvil manipulable (1956) represent the beginnings of the artist’s research into the dissociation of the binomial of form and colour and the fragmentation of the plane, research that the artist approached in order to transcend the notions of the purpose of art.This exhibition presents five of the eight proposals developed by the artist, based on three colour conditions (subtractive, additive and reflective), each of them responding to different colour behaviours.The Couleur Additive (1959) is based on the radiation of colours. When one colour plane touches another, a coloured line appears at the point of contact. And yet this virtual colour is not in the medium. By isolating this optical phenomenon, Cruz-Diez obtains what are known as “chromatic event modules”, responsible for the continuous transformation of colour.The Physichromie (1959) are structures designed to reveal certain circumstances and conditions related to colour, changing according to the movement of the viewer and the intensity of the light, and thus projecting colour into space to create an evolutionary situation of additive, reflective, and subtractive colour. The movement of the viewer or the light source creates a series of chromatic variations.The Inductions Chromatiques (1963) are closely related to the phenomenon of after-image, or retinal persistence. In other words, the retina of the eye, after gazing at a coloured plane for a certain length of time, retains, even after the observer has looked away, an image of the plane – but now in the induced colour or complementary colour. Inductions Chromatiques make visible a phenomenon that can only be captured momentarily and in very specific circumstances. The colour that appears is and is not – it has a virtual existence – but is just as real as the pigments used.Induction Chromatique à double fréquence (2018) on the long wall of the corridor is one of the monumental works whose format relates to the architecture of the space. The viewer’s movements around the work, as well as the viewing distance and luminosity, reveal with greater force and precision the chromatic changes and effects that appear and disappear in the course of the dialogue generated between the viewer and the work, making walking an aesthetic act.The Chromointerferences (1964) result from the superimposition of parallel lines (modules of chromatic events) modulating the colouring of the work according to the distance from which the viewer looks at it. Created during a silk-screening project focusing on Couleur Additive, the artist overlaid a transparent sheet of plastic and observed the colour interferences. These cause blurred vision and generate colour ranges that are invisible on the original medium.The Pyramide Chromointerférente (2007) creates a situation of immateriality, revealing the transfiguration and ambiguity of colour. By projecting moving chromatic interference modules onto the volume, the pyramid becomes transparent and virtually changes shape and condition.The Transchromies (1965) are based on the behaviour of colour by subtraction. Transparent coloured slats are used at different distances and in a specific order to play on the intensity of the light and the ambient colour. The resulting modular transparency allows the viewer to see partially through the colours.About the artist:Cruz-Diez’s work has been the subject of numerous solo and group exhibitions around the world. His works can be found in the following prestigious collections: Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York;Tate Modern, London;Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris;Centre Pompidou, Paris;Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne; Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), Los Angeles;Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebæk, to name but a few.Among the many awards he has received are Friend of Human Rights, International Solidarity for Human Rights, Miami;Penagos de Dibujo Prize, Fundación Mapfre, Madrid; Officier de l’Ordre national de la Légion d’honneur, Paris; Gold Medal, Americas Society/ Council of the Americas, New York;Gold Medal, Norwegian International Print Triennial, Oslo;Honorary Doctorate posthumously, Central University of Venezuela, Caracas.In 2005, the Cruz-Diez Foundation was created, a non-profit organisation founded at the initiative of the artist and his family, dedicated to the conservation, dissemination and promotion of his artistic and conceptual legacy.From summer 2023, a number of institutions joined forces with the family, the studios and the Cruz-Diez Foundation to celebrate the centenary of the 20th century’s last thinker on colour. A major retrospective at the Centre Pompidou Málaga is now open until September 2024.Galleria Continua’s representation of the artist, which began in 2022, also led to the production of the book Color en el plano / Color en el espacio, published in 2023.",Carlos Cruz-Diez: L’Euphorie de la couleur,"87 rue du Temple, 75003",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 2 Apr  - 28 May 2024

The artist’s first solo exhibition in Japan and his largest ever in Asia, Afro-Mingei centers on the cultural hybridity that informs Gates’s work, combining Black diasporic culture with Japanese craft traditions. Together, the exhibitions in France and Japan present interrelated aspects of his wide-ranging oeuvre, bridging both the works’ individual significance and the modes of public address that are fundamental to his practice.Made with roofing material of bitumen-infused polyester mats known as torch down, these complex, collage-like compositions of layered and juxtaposed color bear the marks of flame and tar used to bind them together. These transformative processes are charged with significance both as vital infrastructure that usually goes unnoticed and as the artist’s familial legacy. Included in the exhibition at Le Bourget is the tar kettle that he inherited from his late father, a professional roofer. For Gates, working with tar is a means to produce art that engages with modernist abstraction as well as modes of craft and labor, while serving to commemorate his father.For the first time, Gates incorporates words into his tar paintings, using large stencils to apply them and competing with the scale of billboards. “1-800 ROOFING” is a slogan that advertises a fictive company, reinforcing the artist’s conception of art as a collective endeavor. In addition, he incorporates silkscreened imagery from the archives of the Johnson Publishing Company, the Chicago-based publisher of Ebony and Jet magazines, which Gates has preserved in their entirety through his Rebuild Foundation. The silkscreened image of a singer signifies the central role of Black music and musicians in defining American culture.",Theaster Gates: Black Mystic,"26 avenue de l’Europe, 93350",Tue-Sat 11am-6pm, 13 Apr  - 23 Jul 2024

Her pictorial cosmology, which is concerned with what it is possible to express, or to make visible, is in no way an off-the-ground phantasmagoria. Indeed, Lucie Picandet has chosen to root her work in the organic nature of the body, which links us to all living things. This organicity is beyond the grasp of language, but certainly not beyond the effects of speech, as psychoanalysis teaches us. How can we restore the reality deficit filtered through language, logic and discursive reason? By symbolically giving a voice to fictional, non-human entities such as parasites, radiolarians, bats, gorillas and octopuses, Lucie Picandet conjures up a relativistic space that could accommodate the multiplicity of worlds (...) Lucie Picandet's ambitious project to connect us to a ""bodily perception"" unfolds with humour, tenderness and fantasy.She has been doing this ever since she wrote a poem with the evocative title ""Le Grand Tanneur"" (The Great Tanner) in 2006, and deploys this approach in paintings whose organic forms refer to landscape, taking uson a journey through a large imaginary body. Flattened by a series of cuts inspired by the shapes of anatomical plates, these bodies, open like coats, house multiple worlds whose capillary effects always occur on the edge of the landscape, on the boundary between the exterior and the interior. In these ""interior landscapes"", Lucie Picandet uses topographical analogies that borrow from ecology, the notion of earth and humus, and from medicine, through notions of cosmetics and symptoms, surface and depth, healing and repair. By paying homage to the figure of the earthworm, or the parasite, she turns our attention to the gestation of living forms that takes place beneath our feet, or that of the vast microbial world that our bodies harbour. Her 'hospitable landscapes' welcome the evils of the earth and transform them into exuberant flora. In the ""mythical subterranean city"" of Agartha, painted in 2022, and of which the cave painted this year is perhaps an extension, ""the drops of sweat from our sick world fall to find a place of choice, they are set like precious stones"". Lucie Picandet's work seems to be entirely influenced by the Platonic notion of the ""Pharmakon"", revived by the philosopher Jacques Derrida to reflect on the paradoxical dynamics of written expression. It is both a source of ills and cures, a poison and a remedy, an outlet that is as addictive as it is liberating.So, within this imaginary pharmakological universe, animated by inter-species solidarity networks, she imagined it Incarnatrices. “Unlike carnivorous plants, they allow spirits or ideas to pass through their long, nourishing stems to form, take shape and blossom into brilliantly beautiful flowers.” “They are life machines, halfway between a totem (or sceptre) and an alien. They express (...) the mystery of Greek phusis : that by which life grows”. Should we put Lucie Picandet's multi-dimensional, multi-directional glasses on our nose, they will reveal how the extraordinary meticulousness of her paintings is a poetic incitement to suspend the many technological constructions that take us away from the sensitive world, and to enter fully into a nature that is also profoundly our own, to carve out its future with the strength of renewed wonder, and without fear of its desires.Marguerite Pilven",Lucie Picandet: Charnières,"33 & 36 Rue de Seine, 75006",Mon-Sat 10.30am-7.30pm, 29 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

Red, pink and blue flowers with generous, open petals. Animals too. Carp, cranes, peacocks. Various plants.These are familiar motifs. These are the patterns found on Manila shawls, embroidered stoles closely associated with Spain but whose origins are more complex. Historically made in China, they were shipped between the 16th and 19th centuries on the galleons of the Spanish Empire via the Philippines and Mexico, before finally arriving in Spain to become a traditional folk accessory and a typical symbol.In a double movement of deconstruction and illumination, Pilar Albarracín has chosen to use them as motifs for a series of recent works called Almas Robadas « Stolen souls » in English, isolating them and reproducing them on paper on a large scale. Then in her studio turned into an embroidery workshop - a medium familiar to the artist born in 1968 in Seville - a metamorphosis takes place. Busy around the large drawings, a makeshift sewing workshop covers the backs of the painted flowers and animals with thousands of pins that precisely follow the coloured lines and contours.They redraw them by piercing the paper in a repeated, almost ritualistic gesture. Literally pinned, the motifs change in meaning, nature and appearance.Imitating the fabric, their steel second skin is both captivating and unsettling. This duality is part of their story and is embodied in the space: the works can be seen on both sides, presenting two opposing facets. Two different visions of the same reality. One seductive and violent, the other harmless and neutral. It is a question of point of view.If you look up, you will see another equally ambivalent sight in the form of the installations Rompimiento de gloria I and II from the Lujo Iberico series (2001). Their title refers to the technique used in painting and high relief from the Renaissance to the Baroque period to separate the earthly and celestial worlds. Here Pilar Albarracín has fun linking them together, with the humour and irreverence that characterizes her work. Hailing from Sierra de Aracena where the emblematic Iberian Pata Negra is made, the artist transforms the gallery into a sumptuous delicatessen, hanging from the ceiling a set of dark velvet pieces in the shape of chorizo and blood sausage, which she considers to be her version of Proust’s madeleine cakes. It is a way of coming to terms with a given cultural heritage, of playing with it and combining the vulgar with the sacred by dressing everyday sausage in fabric worn by kings and religious dignitaries.« Alta Tensión », her new exhibition at Galerie G.P & N. Vallois, is something of a melting pot. A melting pot of different worlds, traditions, eras and dominations. Pilar Albarracín goes back in time and history, revisiting established narratives, codes and clichés that forge cultures and identities, assigning and fixing people and ideas.She pins them down, turns them around and questions them with genuine gentleness and intensity.Barbara Soyer",Pilar Albarracín: Alta tensión,"33 & 36 Rue de Seine, 75006",Mon-Sat 10.30am-7.30pm, 29 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

From then on, natural energy sources (the wind, water, light, gravity), their beauty and unpredictability, would be at the heart of his creative process.Thanks to a series of decisive encounters, Susumu Shingu gradually developed his sculptural vocabulary, imbued with poetry and technicality, contemplation and humanism. Striving for ever greater lightness and harmony with nature, the artist develops his materials over time. Marvelling at the infinite variation of natural forms, Susumu Shingu has never ceased to gather precious lessons from them, attempting to give form to the elusive, to the depth and fleeting nature of the universal breath.The natural world around me is a constant source of inspiration in all its varied movements, and I still draw on it today for ever new principles. The more I observe nature, the greater my joy, and when the finished work comes to life, connected to the energies of nature, I see it as the birth of new life, and it is then that my joy reaches its fullness. This Earth – our planet – is for me a home full of mysterious charms where I find inexhaustible treasures for my creation.– Susumu ShinguLa Caravane du Vent, created in 2000, took 21 sculptures to 6 places around the world, chosen by the artist for their emblematic winds, extreme climates, unspoilt nature and unspoilt populations: the rice fields of Sanda in Japan (June 2000), the uninhabited island of Motukorea in New Zealand (November 2000), the rocky desert of Tamdaght in Morocco (April 2001), the green steppe of Undur Dov in Mongolia (June 2001), and the dunes of Cumbuco in Brazil (November 2001). During this year-long journey, the artist and his wife explored the planet among the Maoris, the Mongols, the Sami, the Berbers…In 2006, the gallery dedicated its first exhibition to the artist, Sculptures du respir, followed in 2009 by Planet of Wind and Water, in which the artist presented a model of his project Breathing Earth, a self-sufficient village powered by the natural energies of wind, water and sun; a place of inspiration, exchange and creation for artists, scientists and children… This project was the subject of the film Breathing Earth – Susumu Shingu’s Dream, by director Thomas Riedelsheimer, whom first came to the gallery in 2006.Whether intended for interior or exterior spaces, Susumu Shingu’s work it is at once profoundly terrestrial and human, as well as in constant rotation in the Void, like an unfolding Galaxy. Earthly, because of the variety of shapes, colours and movements that characterise them and in which our planet abounds; human, because of the particular charm that they embody, giving each of them a specific android character. Galactic, because their grace and slow, precise movement play with the orbits of air, water and light, giving us a sense of the infinitesimal measure of Space-Time. Playing with gravity and driven by the breath of the elements that provide their choreography, these sculptures unfold in perfect balance and osmosis between Matter and Void, like technological spaceships seeking to enter into a profound dialogue with Mother Nature.– Véronique Jaeger, Vaisseaux terrestres, in the exhibition catalogue for Spaceship by Susumu Shingu, Mudam Luxembourg, 2018-2019Following on from the 2012 exhibition Au-delà du Temps at the gallery and as part of the FIAC Hors les Murs programme, his work Sinfonietta of Light, an aerial ballet of ten pairs of wings animated by water and wind, was installed in the large octagonal basin of the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris. In 2014, his Wind Museum was inaugurated in Sanda’s Arimafuji Park in Japan, a true natural setting where the artist lives and works, between Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto. Twelve of his sculptures are installed there, including the emblematic Satoyama windmill sculpture. In 2018, the Cosmos exhibition was held at the gallery in conjunction with the exhibition Spaceship at Mudam Luxembourg, which honoured this world-renowned artist with his first exhibition in Europe featuring some fifteen works, including La Caravane du Vent.In 2019, to mark the 500th anniversary of Leonardo da Vinci’s death and the start of construction of the Chambord castle, a major exhibition initiated by the gallery was devoted to him at the Domaine national de Chambord: Susumu Shingu, une utopie pour aujourd’hui.Chambord is not only made of stone, but it is also of air. The stone breathes and is reflected in the water. Everything is still except for the reflections. And then Shingu creates movement. With his sculptures in water and wind as mysterious and light as the silhouette of the castle.– Renzo PianoThe ecological dimension of his creations finds a perfect echo in an area entirely dedicated to nature; like Da Vinci, Susumu Shingu is inspired by the question of flow and perpetual movement. He makes numerous preparatory drawings and sketches. Like those of the Florentine master, they show a great attention to detail, to form and material, and an essential dreamlike dimension. The exhibition also includes Susumu Shingu’s most important work: Atelier Earth, a model of the utopian village he designed, powered by natural energy. An artistic and cultural centre, this village is designed in part for children, allowing them to discover art through their five senses. “A place where we can reflect on the future of the Earth, in collaboration with artists, musicians, writers, academics, philosophers, engineers and scientists from all over the world,” writes Shingu. This dream project, which the artist has been developing for years, will be inaugurated in 2024-2025 in Arimafuji Park, which already houses his Wind Museum.Susumu Shingu doesn’t limit himself to a single field of artistic expression, he also explores the world of theatrical creation: in the 90s, he wrote and directed a theatre piece, Kippis and his friends, which takes place around his Water Tree. The play tells the story of extraterrestrials who discover Earth and question the meaning of human presence. The artist is also known for his many works for children, published by Gallimard Jeunesse. Reflecting deep inspirations found in nature, these books, sometimes created in the voice of his puppet alter ego, Sandalino, are veritable invitations to travel.Shingu’s artistic career has been marked by frequent collaborations with renowned designers such as Issey Miyake, Jiří Kylián, Tadao Ando and, above all, Renzo Piano. Over time, a true creative complicity has developed between the two artists: in 2016, three sculptures by Susumu Shingu were installed at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Centre in Athens, designed by Renzo Piano. In October 2021, the architect inaugurated a residential tower with panoramic views overlooking the Hudson River in the Soho district of New York with a new sculpture by Susumu Shingu, Rainbow Leaves, marking the tenth collaboration between the two. From July to September 2023, the Nakanoshima Art Museum in Osaka paid tribute to the dialogue and friendship between the two artists with an exhibition entitled Parallel Lives.For this exhibition, his fifth at the gallery and his first in France since 2019, Shingu presents four new sculptures. Reflection of Rainbow is undoubtedly the most spectacular: like his large-scale water sculptures, this work is animated by a perpetual movement arranged by the multiple spillages of liquid that set the elements of the sculpture in motion, in a mechanism that is as precise as it is fluid. This consummate art of combining engineering technique with artistic imagination is reflected in the aerial movements of La Pace, which continues to glorify the luminous face of a world that despite everything, is serene and at peace. For Shingu’s creations neither weigh nor pose, like a bird’s wing evoked in another wind sculpture, Catch and Run, while the Japanese master’s most recent work, Menuet, reminds us that flight is undoubtedly the state closest to dance, and to music… These four new sculptures resonate in the exhibition with a group of older works that are characteristic of the artist’s subtle art: white or yellow aerial effusions, or Petit Bois, made up of graceful stems that sway slightly in the slightest breeze. The exhibition will also be accompanied by drawings, sketches, and studies that illustrate Shingu’s creative process and his unique way of deploying the two-dimensionality of his sketches in space.",Enchan-Temps: Susumu Shingu: Le Souffle d’Ici – L’Eau de là [The Breath of Here – The Water Beyond],"5 rue de Saintonge, 75003",Tue-Sat 10am-7pm, 2 Mar  - 13 Jul 2024

At once monumental and intimate in scale, his work recalls post-Minimalist sculpture that alludes to North America’s industrial past. Drew transforms accumulations of raw materials such as wood, glass, plaster, and cotton to articulate various overlapping themes: the cyclical nature of life and decay and the erosion and regeneration of nature from time. His surfaces surge with intrinsic energy, with a tension between the formal structure of the grid and the unruly energy of nature that is both creation and destruction.Drew’s second exhibition at Galerie Lelong, Paris, will highlight a new site-responsive explosion installation and a series of “core” works that include glass and painted plaster. Each new material offers Drew a new canvas of possibility of reinvention and extension and at the same time, the re-purposing of materials gives them new energy and meaning. Drew adapted the site responsive explosion to reflect Lelong’s historic 18th century environment. “The adaptability of the work is the life of the work,” says Drew, and the relationship and reinvention of the sculpture to site is a challenge he accepts.Drew’s most recent solo exhibitions have been at Yorkshire Sculpture Park (2023) and the Amon Carter Museum (2023-2024).

In the early 1960s, her association with leading figures such as the painter Asger Jorn and the writer Guy Debord, both initiators of the Situationist International, quickly brought her and her paintings and prints to the European avant-garde scene of the time. In 1962 she launched the magazine The Situationist Times, which she ran until 1967 with great strength of character, bringing her into contact with a large number of artists.Influenced in her early years by the colourful energy of the Dutch Cobra painters, she quickly moved on to explore, in a highly personal way, playful themes as well as poignant subjects such as war, migration and the emancipation of women. In recent years, her work has been widely recognised internationally through gallery exhibitions in Europe and New York, and in museums such as the Stedelijk Museum and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Abattoirs in Toulouse, and the Cobra Museum in Amstelveen.Her engraved work (lithography, silkscreen, etching, digital printing) spans six decades and remains relatively unknown, particularly in Paris, even though this is where many of these prints were produced.

They are striking for their diversity of materials, shapes and colours, and can be interpreted on several levels. Verboom’s sculpture is often associated with the notion of hybridisation, insofar as she brings together seemingly distant or even opposing elements to create new forms: parts of musical instruments, mechanical objects or anthropomorphic representations combine in a poetic narrative that arouses the viewer’s curiosity. This sculpture is, however, anything but anecdotal. There are numerous references to roots, both personal and collective, as well as to the history of art (witness the Madonnas series, and the references to Bourdelle and Maillol in the new works). Verboom places artistic gesture and technical experimentation at the heart of her practice: porcelain is sometimes enamelled, sometimes matt, and contrasts with crystal, which in the latest works evokes the milky whiteness of alabaster.For her first exhibition at Galerie Lelong & Co. she is presenting four Achronies, superimposed elements of different shapes, colours and materials that rise up in columns and evoke “cores”, cylindrical samples of soil that help us to better understand the geology and archaeology of a place. These are intimate, contemporary archaeologies, where we find superimposed the modelling of a clockwork mechanism, a double portrait of Virginia Woolf and Simone de Beauvoir, a Merovingian capital, an element from a flute, etc. In conversation with these totem poles, small-scale sculptures, figures and high-reliefs in clay and glass will also be shown.Upon graduating from the Paris École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts (2009), Verboom joined the De Ateliers artist-in-residence programme (Amsterdam, 2009/2011). Her recent solo exhibitions include Megaron, Wentrup Gallery, Berlin, 2023; Pistillus, le Voyage à Nantes, 2023; Chryséléphantine, La Verrière - Fondation d’entreprise Hermès (Brussels, 2023); Peptapon, Le Carré Centre d’art contemporain (Château-Gontier, 2021); La Vitrine, FRAC Île-de-France (Paris, 2020) and Lectio Difficilior Potior, at the Musée de l’Abbaye de Sainte-Croix (Les Sables, 2015).

Marian Goodman,Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/rendez-vous-no1/,https://www.galleriesnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Marian-Goodman-Gallery-Paris-1.jpg,,,"From the street, through the window of the 66 space, the sculptural cloud of Portrait (The Concept-Artist Smoking Head, Stand-In) (2016) by Nairy Baghramian invites visitors to discover the exhibition. The title of the photograph echoes the artist's reflection on the political potential of sculpture, which, through its formal and material characteristics and its specificities of presentation, embodies theoretical ideas and principles.At the entrance of the space, the photograph Makunaíma (1971) by Lothar Baumgarten features another portrait; that of a figure from Amerindian mythology, embodied by the artist himself wearing a cardboard mask topped with feathers. This mythical figure, known to Baumgarten through the writings of ethnologist Theodor Koch-Grünberg, enabled him to explore the concepts of identity and otherness.The sculpture Clara 1 (2018) is emblematic of the synthesis operatedin Leonor Antunes' work, in which natural materials and artisanal techniques draw inspiration from prominent figures, particularly female, of modernism in architecture and design to create a reinterpretation of sculpture. The work in teak wood and cotton cord pays subtle homage to Cuban-born designer Clara Porset (1895-1981).With Untitled (Somalia/L'Ange de mer, L'Hydre ou Serpent Marin, Le Marteau, La Tête du Marteau séparée du Corps) (2022), Anri Sala proposes an unprecedented encounter between an 18th-century engraving and an abstract drawing he made in ink and pastel. The diptych, part of the Untitled (Map/Species) (2018-2022) series, premiered at the Rotonde de la Bourse de Commerce in Paris, alongside the presentation of his film Time No Longer.It's a romantic rendezvous that Annette Messager's work suggests, except that in Les amoureux (2016), small, intertwined dolls wrapped in black aluminum foil, hang from a butcher's hook. Emblematic of the small assemblages she creates with a variety of materials, the sculpture evokes the duality of the amorous relationship, both comforting and dangerous.Longtime friends Tacita Dean and Julie Mehretu collaborated on a major installation in 2018 entitled Monotype Melody (ninety works for Marian Goodman), in which they each created 45 monotypes, including Found Postcard Monoprint (Wolverine Mine) and Monotype #16. While Dean enhances an old postcard with color, Mehretu draws her singular marks in black ink and spray.Giovanni Anselmo's interest in the Earth's force of gravity and energy, in our connection with the cosmos, and in the boundary between the visible and the invisible, the finite and the infinite, infuses his entire practice. His monochrome graphite drawing on paper Particolare del lato in alto della prima I di Infinito (1975) reveals a 'visible and measurable detail' of the concept of infinity, in the form of a fragment of the letter 'i'.Niele Toroni's work/painting delivers no message; for the artist, what's important is what's on view: n°50 imprints repeated at regular 30 cm intervals. Applied not on a monochrome support but on the pages of an Italian sports gazette, the imprints are intended to re-actualize our visual experience, since according to the painter, each n°50 brushprint is never the same. For Toroni, painting is first and foremost an ""apprenticeship in vision.""Renowned for his sculptures and installations that use the physical presence of light to investigate the elusive nature of language and perception, in 2019 Cerith Wyn Evans creates the limited edition, T=R=A=N=S (plane). Its circular void cut into a stretched canvas directs the subtle interplay of light and shadow towards an immaterial drawing projected onto the wall. A deceptively simple device, the void becomes a floating chiaroscuro that animates the monochrome work, in a renewed way on each edition.Through his work, Adrián Villar Rojas explores the conditions of a humanity on the brink of extinction, tracing the boundaries of a post-anthropocene time turned in on itself, in which past, present and future converge. The work on paper From the series La fin de l'imagination (VI) (2020) was conceived from drawings of posters from his past exhibitions, which after being folded, crumpled, covered or enhanced with colored pigments, modified with pan-human stencils, are transformed into a hybrid image, political propaganda or battle flag of a futuristic conflict.For Giulio Paolini, the ""act of exhibition"" can be likened to a rendezvous, in which the works on display constitute a visual narrative that visitors are invited to follow in the same way as the artist himself. Paolini's Per Oscar Wilde (2017) perfectly focuses his aesthetics and thinking on art and its representation, on the figure of the artist and the viewer's gaze. In his complex composition in homage to Oscar Wilde, Paolini borrows and fragments the image of the painting A Private View at The Royal Academy (1881) by William Powell Frith, which depicts a social visit to the museum in Victorian times; the author of The Portrait of Dorian Gray is identified among the visitors.Interested above all in the unpredictable nature of photography, James Welling has been involved since the outset in a variety of investigations into materiality, abstraction, spatiality and color, the latter playing a central role in his work since his first chromatic experiments in the 1970s. With the Degradés series of photograms from 2005, of which Degradé IPMG (2005) is a part, it is in the darkroom that Welling obtains vibrant colors from colored light.A photographic diptych by Dan Graham, Robert Smithson, Union City, N.J.;Woman Cleaning, Saint-Jein plein, Antwerp, (1968;2000) features the last fictional encounter in the exhibition, between his friend the artist Robert Smithson, a major figure in contemporary art, and an anonymous woman cleaning a window. Graham's photographic collages focus on architecture and urbanism, in the tradition of his Homes for America project (1966-1989).",RENDEZ-VOUS Nº1,"79 & 66 Rue Du Temple, 75003",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 3 May  - 1 Jun 2024

Since 2019 he has been able to enter the various sites of CERN, the world's largest particle physics center, located on either side of the French-Swiss border near Geneva.On the first floor of the gallery, several meter-long photographs reveal monumental scientific structures that constitute CERN's Prévessin-Moëns and Meyrin sites. Beam Line Zone 1, Beam Line Zone 2 and ProtoDUNE, each detail infrastructures in Hall EHN1 (Experimental Hall North area 1), the organization's largest building. These panoramic immersive views show complex, visually unintelligible structures that resemble immense technological “landscapes.” Their characteristics and colors are almost reminiscent of sculptural installations. Marked by the absence of any humanity – reminiscent of the deserted New York City streets Struth photographed in the 1970s - these constructions are nonetheless the product of human genius. Like the cathedrals of their day, they represent one of mankind’s greatest technological achievements, enabling us to investigate the origins of the universe.On the lower level of the gallery, works that capture the intricacies of CERN’s mechanisms, such as Magnet 2 and X-ray Telescope, are shown in counterpoint to the Containers series, originally scattered throughout CERN's various halls, and recently the subject of interest to the artist. In contrast to the imposing infrastructures presented on the first floor, these pictures, taken from an omniscient perspective, are smaller in scale and represent remnants of technological discovery. Within the containers, materials and objects are layered, having been temporarily discarded, for potential reuse in future experiments. This random detritus, taken out of context by Struth, becomes an ordered composition that frames the accumulations as if they were artworks in themselves.In the final room of the exhibition, the CERN works give way to Animals, another group of photographs taken at the Leibniz Institute for Wildlife and Zoo Research (IZW) in Berlin, where Struth has been visiting regularly since 2016. The IZW's mission is to study the diversity and evolution of the world's wildlife, both free-living and captive, and in particular the anthropogenic impact on species and their ecosystems. Once again, Struth points his lens at activities little known to the public: the laboratory's researchers, just hours after the natural death of an animal, methodically dissect it to analyze the causes of its demise. Each work shows, against a solemn dark gray background, an animal's remains before dissection, like a prelude to a kind of ritual. These post-mortem photographs, with their painterly aesthetic, follow in the long tradition of memento mori: ""I've tried to represent animals in a beautiful and dignified way. I'm interested in the idea of abandonment: once you die, the whole circus you proactively create, the theater, comes to a complete halt. These images should be like punches, the memory of death like a wake-up call."" But the subject of the series is not just the death of the animal; as the state of the brain, photographed just after it has been removed, underscores, it is the way in which the science of our Anthropocene era seizes upon this death for the purposes of study that is at the core of Struth's reflections.Thomas Struth, born 1954 in Geldern, Germany, lives and works in Berlin. He studied at the Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf. Recent comprehensive exhibitions of his work include Figure Ground, his largest show to date, which was presented at Haus der Kunst in 2017 in Munich before traveling to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in 2019, as well as Nature & Politics presented successively at the Folkwang Museum in Essen, the Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin, the High Museum in Atlanta, the Moody Center for the Arts in Houston, the St. Louis Museum of Art and the MAST Foundation in Bologna between 2016 and 2019.Recently, Struth has had solo exhibitions at the Hilti Art Foundation, Vaduz, Lichtenstein (2019), Aspen Museum of Art, United States (2018) and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2014).

Recalling his own memories of the play, the impact and the culture of spectacle that continues to inform the incident today, Barney addresses the consequences of a sport that has become synonymous with physical brutality. Moving from pregame to game, from play to impact, and finally arriving at the media’s relentless repetition of the collision itself, the exhibitions examine the connective tissue that joins our scopophilic desire to witness lethal force with the anxieties stirred by the vulnerabilities of our own bodies.Consistent with Barney’s practice, the sculptural works in the exhibition trespass from the screen to the gallery, blurring the distance between the artist’s constructed cinematic narratives and the corporeal. Comprised of a range of materials that exhibit individual intrinsic behaviours, the objects in SECONDARY probe issues of time and aging. Conjuring the limits of the body by using mediums that respectively indicate elasticity (synthetic polymers), strength (cast metals), and fragility (ceramic), Barney both memorialises and pathologises the Tatum/Stingley event. Also included in each exhibition are a new series of large-scale drawings on aluminium panel, each of which expands upon the motif of the field emblem. Simultaneously diagrammatic and abstract, these drawings examine issues of repetition, memory, and the flux between the symbolic and the real.For his installation at Galerie Max Hetzler, SECONDARY: object impact, Barney presents a series of objects that address the concept of impact as both a physical interaction and a theoretical system of exchange. Central to the exhibition is impact BOLUS, a sculpture that strips back the prosthetic skin of the artist’s iconic 1991 work, DRILL TEAM: screw BOLUS, and exposes its unguarded interior. The piece is largely comprised of casts made from the negative space between Tatum and Stingley (performed in the film by Raphael Xavier and David Thomson) at the moment of contact. Memorialising the exact distance between the two colliding players, the sculpture suggests an interaction that ricochets between extreme violence and physical intimacy. With its series of vertebrae-like elements draped in a shroud of netted dumbbells, impact BOLUS edges incrementally towards figuration, its components exploring both the body and a culture that demands its sacrifice in exchange for entertainment. Also included in the installation is Patriot, a white polyethylene structure draped with Stingley’s jersey that hovers between effigy and ghost. Here, Barney’s historical investigations are both conjured and negated; in lieu of probing the relationship between resistance and material potential, the artist instead presents a pair of objects in a state of exhaustion.The video installation, SECONDARY, is on view concurrently in Paris at the Fondation Cartier from 8 June to 8 September 2024.",Matthew Barney: SECONDARY: object impact,"46 & 57, rue du Temple, 75004","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-7pm", 7 Jun  - 25 Jul 2024

Aged 34, the artist has transformed the gallery space, rendering it feverish: a large number of paintings and drawings cover almost the entirety of the gallery’s walls, in an exhilarating, oozing yet chiseled juxtaposition. Here, a large-format digital print on acrylic is laid bare on the wall. There, a series of head drawings on loose sketchbook pages run rigorously along an imagined ridgeline. Further ahead, is a framed collage, breaking with the compulsive hanging dynamics of the rest of the exhibition.The vast majority of the works date from 2023, a year marked by My-Lan Hoang-Thuy’s residency in Montmartre and two major exhibitions, where we discovered the artist ""and the boys"" as well as her hybrid use of photography (i). And it is undoubtedly in response or reaction to these three events that the genesis of such a proposal, boldly welcomed by the gallery, is worth seeing.My-Lan Hoang-Thuy and the boys. Or rather: My-Lan and the Boys Band. This uninhibited title marks the young artist's entry into the pantheon of the greatest names in modern and contemporary art. In this exhibition at Christies from September 8 to 21, 2023, My-Lan's works were presented in subtle dialogue with those of her ""fathers/peers"": Lee Ufan, Victor Hugo, Pierre Bonnard, Kai Althoff and the studio of Wiliam Morris. In a secluded, inconspicuous room, the artist had arranged reproductions of her teenage drawings, the tenor of which can only be touching. Shy, cheerful drawings of the Spice Girls, framed for the occasion, bore the status of confession. In this very spot, in September 2023, My-Lan was already revealing another part of herself. She was telling her story through her fantasized entourage (the Boys Band) and through an adolescent gesture characterized by a rereading of the emotions and myths specific to that tender, ungrateful age.Her new exhibition at the Galerie Mitterrand is a delightful extension of this. The Spice Girls, once plunged into the darkness of a padded room, have now emerged from their sheet of paper. They are reunited under every facet of My-Lan Hoang-Thuy's work, who takes advantage of her own impertinence to present a display of immense vi-ta-li-ty. Let's face it, age is a matter of mood, and the gallery resembles the walls of a teenager's bedroom. But here, My-Lan doesn't play the young girl. On the contrary, she exhibits her great erudition, which lingers on the art of mural composition, reviving the feverish spirit of fan-art hangings and 19th-century reproduction collectorsii. Better still, the erudition turns to the artist, who no longer encumbers herself with tutelary figures. She is the star. Framed tightly around her upturned face, she proudly gazes out at us in one of her inkjet- on-acrylic self-portraits. In this work, My-Lan leaves aside the representation of her own body to focus on her face and the corporeality of her painting, which makes a case for the image ""tattooing"" the material. The artist fully inhabits her painting, just as she inhabits and modulates her light, starting with that of her Montmartre studio, which it flooded in 2023.Two ""studio"" paintings are displayed above My-Lan’s en gloire portrait - Autoportrait (1). Respectively Montmartre 6 and Montmatre 3, represent pieces of glimmer, emanating from a door or a window, that the artist photographed from her former “green encircled” studio. Did her time at Art Explora's studio bring her painting of photography (the medium of light) more in line with that of painting, to the point where the latter absorbed the image? It would seem so. The new paintings are bursting with light emanating from the pictorial material: northern light, metallic light, ectoplasmic light, and iridescent light. Unlike Montmartre 6 and Montmatre 3, Steppu and Trousseau Crème transfigure the luminous vibration that is no longer a matter of representation. In this, they share an unintentional affinity with the shimmering canvases of Anna Eva Bergman, particularly her rock walls, executed on her return from a trip to the Norwegian wilderness in the late 60s.While this reference is not intended by the young artist, it does provide an important notion of painting as a vibratory space and a medium for the unspeakable. Indeed, this is a particularity shared by Lee Ufan with regard to his own work: to experience painting is also to feel its space- filling vibration and recognize its resonance.Solo Rose, the smallest work in the exhibition, acts as a guardian of this vibration: traces of oil pastel sprinkle a patch of watercolor on adhesive paper. The surface shimmers and opens beyond the visible, beyond the speakable, and even beyond the transitory. My-Lan Hoang-Thuy, like Lee Ufan, would place herself on the side of those things destined to be erased.My-Lan recovers and transforms what fades into oblivion. But can you recycle a memory the way you regenerate a sock? Gratin Gratiné (2022) bears this strange promise. A piece of fabric from one of her companion's old socks is used as a support for a digital print in which we think we recognize the strange silhouette of a woman. The fabric is no mere coincidence or material anecdote. It is the very proof that My Lan is striving to awaken the neglected by giving it an ornament. Other works in the exhibition attest to her wise art of reuse: Qui Aime L'Hiver (2019) and 24 candidats (2022). The caption for the former mentions the use of cardboard packaging and toilet paper rolls. The second doesn't say much about the everyday materials used (India ink, watercolor and acrylic paint on paper). Yet it is the result of the same technique of collecting and putting on hold. The three components (the drawing, the faded background, and the piece of red) were made at different times in the artist's life, then individually preserved in boxes. After a few months' maturing, the artist uses them, juxtaposing these different visual parcels in a gesture akin to a ""self-fiction surge"". This term defines not only the conditions of the work's genesis, but also My-Lan's ability to tell her own story through heterogeneous materials. Applied to the scale of the exhibition, this term would even define the whole of her curatorial gesture: a combination of scattered materials in an autobiographical perspective in which My-Lan takes control of her narrative.During our discussions, My-Lan told me about her problem with a model painting that lacked ""guts"". This comment related to one of her works (Pull Marvin, 2023), which originally depicted a portrait of her partner, of which all that remains is a piece of sweater in the top right-hand corner. This comment goes beyond the description of a single work, as it applies to all her new work, in which she ceases to ""play the model"". The artist is indeed known for her stripped-down photographic self- portraits: poses of herself for herself, which she develops alongside her recurring practice as a model. But the practice of nudity is becoming increasingly rare (her exhibition at the Maison Européenne de la Photographie already marked this first step aside). According to the artist, drawing has taken its place as a means of exposing the nakedness.At the heart of this exhibition, drawing is triumphant, in a nudity that dares not speak its name.These heads, drawn by the dozens, cohabit with a painting that seems to have resolutely taken the step of using material as theme: it is it who draws the motif, raising levels of depth and light. For this reason, My-Lan acts like her painting. They take parallel paths: they draw a line across the space of representation to fully inhabit the body of the painting that dictates itself. What we see here then, cascading down these walls, is called a novel.- Julia Marchand(i) Les expositions Boys Band chez Christies (8 - 21 septembre 2023) et Femme Actuelle à la Maison Européenne de la Photographie (18 octobre – 10 decembre 2023)(ii) Pierre-Lin Renié, 2006, “The Image on the Wall: Prints as Decoration in Nineteeth-Century Interiors”, in Nineteeth-Century Art Worldwide (available online).",My-Lan Hoang-Thuy: Notes,"79, rue du Temple, 75003",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 23 May  - 27 Jul 2024

Behind the conciseness of this statement, worthy of a fairground attraction, lie several centuries of research and challenges between scientists to define the calculation of a cycloid. Nicknamed ""the Helen of Geometers"", it's hardly surprising that its history and properties have captured Raphaël Zarka's attention and curiosity, as his interests converge on movement and its applications, or more precisely on the objects, architectures, and devices capable of generating and measuring it.While it may be necessary to refer here to the artist's ""historicized approach to abstraction"", which consists in identifying the recurrences and shifts over time and geography of geometric forms between different fields of knowledge, and translating them into the field of art, it should be remembered that his work is just as (in-)formed by the practice of skateboarding and its spaces, to which he has devoted several essays. It is no surprise, then, that he has traced this cycloidal curve from an article in a skateboarding magazine from 1985 to the physics cabinets of the 17th and 18th centuries, to the discovery of instruments (or replicas thereof) designed to observe its properties at Padua University's Museum of the History of Physics, then at Florence's Museo Galileo.In the tradition of his ""documentary sculptures"", whose vocabulary refers to geometric abstraction by taking up ""loaded"" forms from the history of art, science, and technology, the Tautochrone (2007) which gives its title to the exhibition is a replica of a double-channel semicircular apparatus attributed to Galileo for studying the isochronism of pendulums. But as the artist explains, ""it took many years before the problem of the isochronism of pendulums and its corollary, that of the tautochronous curve, was solved"" (1) which, contrary to Galileo's belief, is not an arc of a circle, but a cycloid, as the artist materializes in the sculpture Tautochrone vérifié (2010).From a mechanical instrument designed to study the movement of bodies in space to a skateboard ramp, from sculpture to architecture and vice versa, the artist's recent projects place this research on the scale of the human body and urban space. While Cycloïde Square (2024) takes the form of a sculpture-model complexifying the expected forms of a skatepark, evoking both an abstract sculpture by Sophie Taeuber and the astronomical observatory in Jaipur, India, the Cycloïde Piazza (2024) will be on view all summer, a few blocks from the gallery on the forecourt of the Centre Pompidou. An ""instrumental"" sculpture in public space, it becomes a practicable space for gliding, an agora, an amphitheater, a place that encourages movement as well as rest, a piazza within a piazza. Here, the traditional arched ramps of skateparks are transformed into cycloids, with stairs, platforms, tiers, and slopes, inviting us to test the Galilean laws of gravity with this geometric vocabulary.This back-and-forth between works designed for the exhibition space and for the public space, between site and non-site, value of use and of exhibition, is evident in La Doublure (2024) designed as part of the Nouveaux Commanditaires program in Trélazé, Maine-et-Loire. In architectural resonance with a former match manufacture, it combines, with two concrete slabs, the remains of one of the manufacture’s chimneys with a new chimney, a 24-metre-high sculpture whose base provides a room opened by four vents, and the surprise of a spiral brickwork assembly that opens onto the sky. Also a practicable sculpture whose function has yet to be invented, its double structure evokes that of the Second Cénotaphe d’Archimède (2012), a photo-based reconstruction of 16th-century English brick chimneys named in homage to the creator of the “endless screw”. By taking the spiral brick cladding on the chimneys of an English castle and reproducing it inside the lining of an industrial chimney in the French countryside, a dizzying game of echoes and references, translations and re-employments is played out.This mise en abime of historical and geographical strata finally unfolds in a new series of paintings presented in the exhibition. Entitled Bois Gnomonique (2024), it continues the artist's research on gnomons (2) and their functionalist ornamentation. Composed by overlapping and permuting ""instrumental motifs"" (triangles, circles, semicircles, etc.) taken from the bases of 17th- and 18th- century Scottish sundials, in the continuity of Abstractions gnomoniques (2019-2020), these engravings on wood bear witness to the combinatory systems at the heart of the artist's sculptural practice, applied this time to pictorial matter. Following a set protocol that nonetheless allows for chance through the overprinting of colors, they offer new variations on these motifs, like so many palimpsests. A tautochronous experience in which these witnesses to movement appear on every page in the present tense ""in equal times"".— Yoann Gourmel(1) Raphaël Zarka, Free Ride. Skateboard, mécanique galiléenne et formes simples, Éditions B42, Paris, 2021, p.90(2) “Sundial is one way of putting it, gnomon is another, and these two names for the same object say two different things. The sundial is the archaic ancestor of the clock, an instrument lacking in precision that can be swept away by the first hourglass that comes along; the gnomon, on the other hand, means ""he who knows"" and reminds us that by marking the movement of shadows, the gnomon was above all an instrument of knowledge.” Nina Léger, Zarka Fiction, Suite Galiléenne, La Villa Beatrix Enea, Anglet, 2019.",Raphaël Zarka: Tautochrone,"79, rue du Temple, 75003",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 23 May  - 27 Jul 2024

Young girls bask in the tranquility of North American parks and gardens. Nature is idyllic, and nothing seems to disturb the peace of the languid protagonists. Singing, playing the piano, lying on beds or lush patches of grass, striking a pose on a shopping street, or holding a bouquet of white flowers, these girls inhabit a world of serenity, luxury, and pleasure.Yet we know that the “real” world is very different, marred by aggression, violence, tension, and war, leaving little room for relaxation and personal well-being. Beeman’s vision is a Platonic ideal, depicting the world not as it is but as it should be. Over time, she began to diminish the emphasis on individuality in her subjects, perceiving them as components of a singular entity. Currently, the only distinguishing features among these figures are their attire, scale—such as the smaller stature of the little girl compared to others—and occasionally, gender, particularly when depicting romantic relationships. She posits that the world encapsulated within her work might exclude individual experience portraying it instead as an idealized realm of flawless, seamless connectivity. In this envisioned space, the notion of internal conflict or tension within individuals seems incongruous.The history of art is full of recurring faces. Beeman’s work recalls the soft, elongated features and intense gaze of the woman who haunted Sandro Botticelli’s paintings. Like Petrarch’s Laure or Dante’s Beatrice, this enigmatic woman, who utterly captivated the painter, embodies the feminine ideal. Yet there are also echoes of Amedeo Modigliani’s angelic faces with their vacant, soul-searching eyes, as well as the pre-Raphaelite paintings of Rossetti and Burne-Jones.The exhibition is titled Distant Cities. Many works contain architectural elements that serve as reassuring and threatening settings for Beeman’s figures. The city is presented as a metaphor for a future that may not necessarily be bright and from which we try to escape despite the apparent calmness of the scenes. Our relationship with this future becomes more than ambivalent, at times frightening, at times exciting. A smaller figure symbolizes the movement back and forth in time. The artist says, ""She’s a younger version of the ’others.' Sometimes, they seem to protect her. Elsewhere, she appears to be running away, and they try to dissuade her... I often think about time, experience, and that strange feeling of discontinuity that we sometimes have in life, especially during experiences of trauma and loss. Some of the paintings in this exhibition are more memory than fiction, but the line is quite blurred"".Beeman’s work is defined by its clear lines, which are highly graphic and meticulously arranged. Everything in her universe is in its place; even the flight of birds in the sky seems to follow a precise, preordained path. However, one feels that even a minor disruption could create chaos in this well-oiled machine, creating a sense of both solidity and fragility.The paintings have the delicacy of painted silk and the smoothness of marble inlays. Yet they exude a certain coldness, keeping us at arm’s length. There’s something old-fashioned about them, as though they had been painted in a bygone era—as if a major catastrophe had reshuffled the cards, turning the works into signals from another world.

"Perrotin Marais, Paris",Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/klara-kristalova-4/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Klara Kristalova,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/klara-kristalova/,"“I am a sculpting draughtsman and painter”: Klara Kristalova, born in 1967, doesn’t let herself be pigeonholed into categories, and even takes pleasure in defying them. Far from any conventional approach, she allows unexpectedness and singularity to emerge from the abolition of boundaries between the arts, from the exploration of undefined margins. In the mid-1990s, her artistic path took her away from pure painting and towards modelling. She approaches this discipline with a great deal of freedom and playfulness, appreciating both its shaping and its materiality. Kristalova’s ceramics arise from successive transformations. A quick drawing is soon followed by modelling, which develops this initial intention. By kneading, she reconnects with an ancestral practice. The clay is worked directly with the fingers, creating irregularities and shifting surfaces. An initial firing precedes the moment of painting on ceramic, quick and playful... Finally comes the ultimate transformation: the final firing and its unpredictability. Kristalova’s creative process incorporates imperfection, emergence and a certain amount of chance: when the kiln is opened, she particularly likes it when the colours have dripped and blended. When they nestle in an unexpected space, blurring the contrast between the purity of the white and the intentionally cold, dark colours.In the midst of this ceramic population, a few vigorous bronzes temper the vulnerability of the clay.[Beast]Beast invites us to plunge into Kristalova’s enigmatic universe. Reality blends with fiction: human or animal heads and masks rub shoulders with hybrid beings, with unusual distortions of scale. What emerges is a fantastic world where anxiety borders on humour, as with the gigantic insect in The fly’s kiss, whose flower-like proboscis delicately touches the child’s lips. An unexpected moment of tenderness is born from this supernatural kiss.Kristalova blurs the boundaries between nature and humanity. Fascinated by the connection between humans, animals and plants, she combines them at will, like playful and disturbing exquisite corpses. Man as a natural being is omnipresent: he merges into an invasive, all- encompassing nature; the plants incorporate human faces. Are Kristalova’s beings humanoid animals, or are they animalised, vegetalised humans? Probably neither: the hybrid being occupies a space between, a limbo land. Far from the classifications in which humans like to confine the world in order to control it better.The indeterminate nature of these hybrid beings places them in a fantastical universe rooted in symbolism: in front of All my thoughts or the flower-faces, we are irresistibly reminded of Odilon Redon’s Smiling Spider. These beings become “phantasms,” in the etymological sense of apparitions. Are we in another reality or are we in the world of dreams, or even nightmares, a distant cousin of the visions of Munch or Goya? Kristalova’s creatures’ non-compliance with real beings gives them the status of “beasts.” As such, they embody an otherness, a uniqueness, a difference that raises questions: the beast externalises and transposes fears, frustrations, rage and panic into its very appearance, but also expresses a form of outlet, of freedom... A strange people not unlike Gauguin’s ceramic monsters.[Vacillations]Kristalova’s hybrid beings sound out the way we look at others, our society’s complex relationship with monstrosity and deviations from the norm. What room is there for difference when smooth, standardised beauty is valued above all else? The hybrid world challenges the definition of the human, and raises the question of the definition of the body, its limits and its integrity. The transformations undergone by these imaginary bodies are sometimes tinged with a muted violence. The tree branches and roots that sprout from the bodies are as much factors of power, bulwarks against human excess, as they are potential prisons: such is the case of the astonishing Log, a young girl trapped in a trunk that is reminiscent of the piece of wood cradled by the enigmatic “Log Lady” in David Lynch’s universe. When difference calls existence into question.The eruption of plant life into the bodies of young people also reflects the mutation of adolescent bodies, bearers of a vitalistic sap. Power and fragility, playfulness and seriousness, growth and invasion are all at work in these young beings steeped in questions, contradictions and doubts. Worry mingles with insouciance, grandeur with a fragility that can be seen in the attitude of the Mouse, with his hands in his pockets. Yet adolescence is the age of all possibilities, before gender determines how an individual is viewed, before the divorce between the sexes is irrevocably consummated. There is an omnipresent nostalgia for this suspended time.The liminality of physical appearance is also the liminality of an instant: the narrative seems interrupted, without a thread to hold on to. The viewer questions both the nature of the beings and the links between them: why does All my thoughts stand apart? Larger than life, a smiling young girl perched on never-ending stick-legs, seems to move slowly and benevolently amongst the others, like a carnival monster on stilts. A timeless moment in which social norms and conventions are turned on their head. Non-conformity, freedom, distance and entertainment are always active in Kristalova’s work: in the shade of the head-flowers, a Reclining bird lounges in high heels. In Ordinary day, rabbits taunt a disgruntled wolf from the top of a tree.There is no Manichaeism in this suspended world of possibilities. The tipping point is never certain, even when anxiety wells up: is the humanoid Mouse just shy, encircled by the beings around him, or is he threatening them? The young mouse-man reflects the complexity at work in all of us, whether or not we are inclined towards darkness. Simultaneously vulnerable and powerful, he reflects the threat that man poses to the earth. His invocation by the artist is invested with a cathartic value, in the Aristotelian sense of the term: a purifying of the passions. The work therefore has an almost magical, prophylactic value.Concerned about the rise of extremes and mankind’s destructive attitude, Kristalova constructs a world that reveals the fragility of life and the complexity of the relationships that are forged between beings. The viewer is invited to question his or her perception, which changes according to his or her psychology and state of mind. “My art is about language, communication,” says Kristalova. This imaginary dialogue, the keys to which are not revealed, allows each of us to project our own feelings and anxieties... A genuine relationship that engages the individual and integrates him or her into the space of the work: art as experience, to paraphrase John Dewey.Ophélie Ferlier-Bouat, director of Bourdelle museum, Paris",Klara Kristalova: Beast,"76 rue de Turenne, 75003",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 13 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024  
"Perrotin Marais, Paris",Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/julian-charriere-panchronic-gardens/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Julian Charriere,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/julian-charriere/,"Combining installation, sculpture, film, and photography, Charrière’s projects often involve fieldwork in liminal spaces, from industrial extraction sites to volcanic calderas, from remote ice fields to nuclear testing grounds.Fossil fuels are so named because they originate from rocks buried deep in the bowels of the earth, formed over hundreds of millions of years from the decomposition of organic debris. Once extracted, these raw materials can be easily stored, transported, and burnt, making them a highly efficient energy source. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Europe experienced the Industrial Revolution, which relied heavily on hydrocarbon fuels for economic growth. The widespread use of oil, natural gas, and coal facilitated the expansion of factories, machinery, and transportation. Today, we are witnessing the adverse effects of our hyperdependence on this energy triad: its resources are far from inexhaustible, its distribution is subject to geopolitical uncertainties, and its combustion releases pollutants into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the leading cause of global warming. Long ignored or neglected, the impact of greenhouse gases on the environment is now proving disastrous. Expanding deserts, melting icecaps, acidifying oceans, eroding biodiversity, megafires, and other climate disruptions: collapsologist fantasies, dystopian imaginaries, and eco-catastrophes à la J.G. Ballard have become a reality. As the author of The Atrocity Exhibition (1970) put it, today, we’re at the mercy of an “impending Pompeii.”Fire Walk with MeIn his video And Beneath It All Flows Liquid Fire (2019), Julian Charrière displays a burning fountain as a metaphor for this coming conflagration. Presented at the opening of his first solo show organized by Perrotin gallery, this emblematic work highlights the role that fire plays in his art. By transforming the fountain motif into a symbol of our vanities, the Franco-Swiss artist reminds us that Western society entered modernity through a baptism of fire. These fascinating blazes illustrate the concept of the Pyrocene, the age in which the combustion of fossil fuels and the fires caused by droughts are turning our planet into a furnace. The same aesthetic of oxymorons is evident in Buried Sunshines Burn (2023), a series that explores the consequences of fossil fuel extraction in California, using heliography to transform aerial views of oilfields into a subtle play of appearances. Heliography, which means “writing of the sun,” is a process invented by Niépce in the early 19th century, during the prehistory of photography. The materials’ golden and silvery viscosity gives a luminous quality to the images of soil contaminated with heavy metals found in oil. There is a psychedelic sparkle in the mirages and maledictions of this black gold. Beneath the flashy surface, we are consumed by demons.Millennia Watching UsJulian Charrière is an artist who ventures into the field to better understand what’s happening to our planet. He seeks out places with ambiguous geophysical identities in the four corners of the globe, where different histories and temporalities overlap: former mining sites, radioactive zones, permafrost in the Far North, palm oil plantations, volcanic regions, and deep-sea abysses. Going back in time and into the depths of the Earth, his artistic investigations probe the speculative and narrative resources of the subsoil. The volcanic rocks that make up the series A Stone Dream of You (2023) have been combined with orbs of black obsidian, whose glassy appearance resembles staring eyes. Arranged on the gallery floor, the minerals collected in Mexico bear witness to millennia-old geothermal phenomena: movements of the earth’s mantle, seismic tremors, and magma eruptions. These chimerical beings stand in our way, staring at us from the depths of time. The reflective sculptures on the walls create further visual interplay. Coalface (2024) consists of large pieces of anthracite coal cut in half that function like distorting mirrors. Thus, the only human presence in the exhibition is the visitors’ furtive, ghostly, grotesque reflection. This optical device echoes the black mirror once used by painters. In keeping with its name, it reflected the world in black and white, isolating light intensities and enhancing contrasts. In addition to its technical properties, the black mirror has had spiritual and esoteric connotations from ancient Mesoamerican culture into the physiological research in the 18th and 19th centuries, and beyond. In the words of artist Odilon Redon, the dark yet brilliant material puts “the logic of the visible at the service of the invisible” – as if to reveal the dark side of our reflection.The Vertigo of InfinityLike the “nonsites” pioneered by Robert Smithson in the late 1960s, Julian Charrière collects soil fragments to conduct geological surveys of the material traces of the planet’s exploitation. “I’m very interested in the chemical cycles of materials, specifically the carbon cycle, which has been greatly affected by the burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution.” Inserted into a large metal grid, an imposing block of coal forms a surreal sculpture with a specially designed cavity where viewers can bury their heads. Soothsayer (2021) offers a strange sensory experience connecting us to another space-time reality. Combining scientific curiosity with a passion for the fantastic, Charrière depicts human time within the vastness of geological time. Encapsulating multiple temporalities, the programmatic, spectacular, immersive Panchronic Garden (2022) gives the exhibition its title. The word “panchronic” refers to an animal or plant organism that bears a strong morphological resemblance to an extinct species. They are also known as relict species. Panchronic Garden brings to life a garden of the third kind, where ancestral ferns reconstitute a biotope from the Carboniferous – the geological era when coal was formed. Over 300 million years ago, our current fossil fuel reserves were lush forests. With its infinitely mirrored carbon fiber floor and walls, infrared light, and sonic maelstrom, Charrière’s terrarium embraces the artificiality of our conception of nature. Sensors linked to computer systems generate soundscape that offer a glimpse into the sophisticated sensory environment of plants. The high-tech devices reveal how such living organisms perceive the stimuli of their ecosystem, a supernatural mode of communication that frees these heroes of planetary preservation from their customary silence. In the various spaces of Panchronic Gardens, time is suspended, producing a vertigo of infinity in the face of the incommensurable. Thus, for Julian Charrière, “art becomes a tool for exploring large abstractions.”An Ecological Memento MoriIn the age of the Anthropocene, where survival depends on redefining how we live in the world, Julian Charrière’s art portrays our understanding and perception of environmental issues. His work, however, goes beyond the confines of so-called ecological art and stands out for its ability to bridge the gap between conceptual approach and sensory experience, science and fiction, archaic processes and futuristic forms. The ecological crisis we are facing is primarily a crisis of sensibility. Therefore, art can play a decisive role in enriching and transforming our relationship with nature and the living. We need artworks that add emotion, symbolism, knowledge, and imagination to our perception of the world in all its irreducibility and complexity. More than an exhibition, Panchronic Gardens is an artistic and cosmic expedition.Stéphane Malfettes, director of the Subsistances, Lyon",Julian Charrière: Panchronic Gardens,"76 rue de Turenne, 75003",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 13 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

It is an act of attempted immortality on a minor scale.”Hernan BasText by Anaël PigeatThe first and the last? But what is this absurd competition? What is this divine realm where these roles are reversed? The darkly humorous subject of Hernan Bas’s exhibition The First and the Last was inspired by the Olympic Games that will take place in Paris this summer. Following his exhibition The Conceptualists at the Bass Museum in Miami, Bas wanted to take a more light-hearted approach and pay tribute to the magnificent losers he is so fond of.Bas begins his paintings or drawings by making lists of titles, which he then converts into images using photographic montages. These images are then projected onto the canvas, to which he applies acrylic paint. In his new exhibition, he presents his drawings as stand-alone artworks for the first time. He has adopted Paul Gauguin’s transfer technique, a delicate practice that consists of coating sheets of paper with ink, turning them over, and drawing on the back to leave the imprint of the strokes on the substrate – a single, too-forceful gesture can instantly ruin the whole thing. He adds up to ten layers of grey using silkscreens. Although he generally employs acrylic in his paintings, he has also experimented with oil highlights on silver strips or fragments of uniforms.Bass’s latest series is populated by a whole host of eclectic characters. Imagine the winner of one of those weekly dance contests during the Great Depression, the contestants pushing themselves to the brink of exhaustion. One character dons a T-shirt that reads, “They shoot horses, don’t they?” In an old-fashioned café, a drinker takes a melancholic sip of absinthe. And could this goldfish really be the first animal on Mars? A young man pruning branches in a bucolic forest seems busy with esoteric projects in an atmosphere reminiscent of the Blair Witch Project. Hernan Bas has been working to complete several pieces, such as his work on paper Finding the First Flock of Flamingos to Return to Florida in a Century, inspired by the recent return of pink flamingos to Florida, where Hernan Bas resides. These birds were hunted to extinction before being reintroduced from Cuba, where Bas’s family is originally from.Hernan Bas combines the idea of vain competition with the desire – perhaps no less vain – of making a mark in history. He shows us ghostly traces on the ceiling of The Eagle pub in Cambridge, created by airmen during the Second World War using wax candles, lighters, and lipstick. In another drawing, a pupil seated at a school desk engraves words into wood in front of mathematical equations on a blackboard, like so many poetic riddles: “The end doesn’t even matter,” “his own name,” “I want pizza.” And in yet another drawing, a figure has carved letters into the leaves of a succulent plant, curiously entitled the tourist tree.Hernan Bas’s exhibition carries a profound sense of the end of the world, often intertwined with elements of humor. In The Last Day that Tower Was Standing, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is seemingly saved from collapse by a tourist’s hand, akin to a holiday snapshot. A man indulges in a final, extravagant meal before an asteroid’s imminent arrival. Ailing in a hospital bed, a man prepares to utter his last words or perhaps to receive them in the form of a postcard... The presence of Picasso’s Guernica in the background of the large painting The Last Museum Guard at the Last Museum on Earth is too somber to elicit a smile. Hernan Bas doesn’t depict the accident; he hints at the impending catastrophe through ambiguous interludes.Anaël Pigeat, art critic",Hernan Bas: The First and the Last,"76 rue de Turenne, 75003",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 13 Apr  - 1 Jun 2024

Is it seductiveness or dread? Is it life or death? Perhaps things do not necessarily have to be in a state of “either/or,” and do not have to be in harmony, but embedded in a heterogenous apparatus of push and pull—existing at the same time, in the same painting.Drew Dodge’s paintings are synergetic systems, colossal monuments that house both life and death. The different motifs that build his paintings are suffused with an explicit symbolism while simultaneously existing as alluring enigmas. And yet, the divergent symbols synchronize, conglomerating into one image whose coherence has distinctness as an underlying ground.Many of Dodge’s motifs have been utilized throughout art history and are charged with meaning that he carries on while simultaneously recontextualizing it. For example, the image of the bull that has been historically used as a symbol of power and stereotypical masculinity (which has turned out to be a rather fragile, disintegrating concept) is reinterpreted by the artist through a queer lens, subverting patriarchal notions by employing an empathic and sensitive perspective. He thereby disrupts and questions societal structural issues without being overtly political; and without any systemic critique becoming too blatant. Recurring ribbons and ropes—opposing forces that are filaments of life or constraining forces—likewise reference subversive notions of power.Another recurring motif in Dodge’s exhibition work is the skull. As the ultimate representation of death and mortality, the skull resides at an intersection of animacy and demise. The artist’s similarly surreal chimeras—dog and human hybrids—which are present as protagonists in every painting often directly interact with the skull; at times they caress it, use it as a tool or instrument, or it simply acts as their companion. While the skull is a reminder of every person’s mortality, it also acts as a representative of the earthly pleasure you got to experience prior to your death.The uncanny chimeras switch in their body language, which is sometimes relaxed and calm and at other times agitated and seemingly disturbed. Their concurrent playfulness and absurdity, referencing cartoons, transports them to a psychological painterly space that is real and unreal, a dreamlike state where experiences from the physical world merge with the imaginative.Having grown up in Arizona, Dodge had to frequently drive through the desert to visit his father who lived far away from his mother. Certain landscapes in the exhibition’s paintings are reminiscent of this childhood memory that sometimes also appears as a fragmented idea, for example only through cacti, which symbolize the physical, visceral, and fleshly. For the artist, deserts are blank canvases, wastelands that are entrenched with emotions and sexuality.Dodge’s use of such enigmatic figures and symbols stem from a desire to uncover the world while letting it remain distant and opaque, somewhat milky, until it becomes accessible. His motifs are flirting with each other, echoing each other, until they become one—sexy and strange, taunting and bewitching, tumultuous and tranquil.Claire Koron Elat",Drew Dodge: Earth Song,"44 rue Quincampoix, 75004",Tue-Sat 11am-7pm, 4 May  - 15 Jun 2024

Freeze… on the image. Yet there’s nothing to do with photographic snaps in all of this, but rather the clash of two cultures. Firstly, that of computer software, 3D imaging, video games and a training course at an animation school—in short, the digital image and the screen, the protective barrier that a teenage Justin erected between himself and the conservative, homophobic environment of Suffolk County on Long Island.Then in 2017, he began to paint, a change of direction confirmed by a visit to the Louvre in 2019, a watershed moment that “literally changed my life and certainly my way of painting.” Today in 2024, All Sunsets Risen showcases the state of grace of this dual movement of liberation: that of leaving the screen behind, as if coming out of the closet, integrating queer culture into canvasses that speak of masculine tastes, depicted in a classical tradition. In order to appreciate just how far he’s come, one needs to take a look at Justin Liam O’Brien’s early paintings. At first, his figures were more rounded and simplified, still influenced by 3D modelling: “the way I approach light, shadow, color and form is undeniably influenced by digital images.” As time went by, his figures became more refined, as if unfolding with each passing painting; necks, wrists and hands elongated in poses that remind us of the men portrayed by Pontormo, Bronzino and Parmigianino. There are no women in this series of paintings and the generally male figures are treated with an avowed mannerist femininity. “Men are my subject, without thinking in terms of gender, but rather in terms of this belief: every painting is a self-portrait.”What does this statement entail? The word “belief” that connects these group scenes, portraits of young men, the painter’s friends, his intimate community, all linked by the depiction of hands, right down to their fingertips, hands that evoke the rhetorical expressiveness of religious paintings. Two index fingers touch, in a scene from a date in a café, a profane promise of a loving “creation.” A bent wrist, seen in a rear-view mirror, reflecting the Deposition of Christ by Pontormo or Bronzino, while a plane pulls a banner through the skies overhead, with the biblical message “There’s only one way to heaven.” Elsewhere, we see a close-up of two palms turned upwards towards the sky in a gesture known as supination.So, what is Justin Liam O’Brien’s essentially narrative painting seeking to tell us? In what or in whom does he believe? Perhaps a world of men united by the idea of redemptive love, a queer community of disciples of whom he would be the “creator.” His first exhibition at Semiose bears witness to the “honeymoon period” of this highly original world, where people fall in love as if for the very first time. When asked where the title came from, Justin replied: “On Valentine’s Day, I wrote a poem in an attempt to find a coherent vision for this series of paintings:All sunsets risen,the heavens and earth merged.Can you measure such a space?As it expands and contractsWhat about hope?Can you measure hope?”So, is it possible to measure hope?

This exhibition offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of Sherman's creative process, tracing the evolution of her seminal series in black and white from its inception to its enduring legacy. Impersonating a variety of film noir female archetypes, from the mysterious self-posessed femme fatale to the submissive, innocent girl, Sherman's ability to inhabit diverse personas challenges viewers to confront their own perceptions of self and society.The premise of the Film Stills found its origin while Sherman was studying photography at Buffalo State University. During this time, Sherman began buying wigs and clothes from thrift stores. Once she moved to New York City, Sherman briefly considered working as a makeup artist. Having studied under and worked for the experimental filmmaker Paul Sharits, Sherman was transfixed by the power of transformation through disguise. Altering factors such as age, social class or gender throughout her career, Sherman has adopted endless identities. For example, in her 1976 Bus Riders series, the artist’s interest in film, body art, and performance began to reveal itself; through the medium of black-and-white photography, the artist began to focus primarily on female roles.In 1977, inspired by low-cost storyboard snapshots she came across in David Salle’s studio, Sherman realized that involving other people in her work would not be necessary. As the Film Stills took shape, she assumed multiple roles as director, author, set designer, makeup artist, hairstylist, casting director, costume designer, and actress in her own veritable one-woman show. The photographs feature the artist in stereotypical female roles inspired by 1950s and ‘60s Hollywood and European art-house films. Presenting an array of characters, Sherman implicates the viewer in constructing the identity of her protagonist. Locations include her fellow artist Robert Longo’s apartment and her own studio. She also used every corner of her flat as an interior set, converting her home into a hotel lobby or room, a hallway, a bathroom.Traditionally, film stills are not individual frames from movies but rather purpose-built reenactments used as a tool for promotion: ‘The still must tease with the promise of a story the viewer of it itches to be told’ (Arthur Danto, Cindy Sherman: Untitled Film Stills, New York, 1990, p. 9). Sherman carefully selects the close-ups, zooming into specific expressions. She invites the viewer into her intimate photographic realm. Rooting herself within the Pictures Generation, Sherman critically reworks the female image through cinematic context, borrowing from the visual style and aesthetic universe of Alfred Hitchcock, subverting his archetypal film narrative. While some photographs portray a solitary woman, others allude to another person outside the frame or suggest the sitter is being watched or followed, creating a palpable tension. Sherman depicts the exact moment preceding or following “the decisive moment”, creating an open-ended discourse. With this series, Sherman aimed to break away from the preciousness of painting and fashion trends at the time, turning instead to low-quality prints and dressing up in old-fashioned looks from the ‘50s and ‘60s.Sherman brought the series to a close in 1980, with a total of seventy photographs, when she noticed she was beginning to repeat herself and that her work had become fashionable. Yet, even now, Sherman’s Film Stills continue to confront the oppressive influence of mass media over our individual and collective identities, particularly the notion of domination and desire imposed by the ‘male gaze’. Placing the female character within the dicta of Laura Mulvey’s influential 1975 essay ‘Visual Pleasure and the Narrative Cinema’, which discusses the female onscreen persona as an objectified subject, Sherman addresses the portrayal of women within the ‘magic of the Hollywood style at its best...[which] arose, not exclusively but in one important aspect from its skilled and satisfying manipulation of visual pleasure’ (Laura Mulvey in Movies & Methods, vol. II, p. 306).‘Desire mixed with nostalgia fuels the allure of the Untitled Film Stills’ (Amanda Cruz ‘Movies, Monstrosities, and Masks: Twenty Years of Cindy Sherman’ in: Cindy Sherman Retrospective, exh. cat., Los Angeles, The Museum of Contemporary Art, 1998, p. 4). Commenting on the gravitas of her protagonists, the artist notes ‘I definitely felt that the characters were questioning something, perhaps being forced into a certain role. At the same time, those roles are in a film: the women aren’t being life-like, they’re acting. There are so many levels of artifice. I liked that whole jumble of ambiguity’. (Cindy Sherman, quoted in Cindy Sherman, exh. cat., The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2012, p. 30).

In the late 1980s, he started using photography, a medium he has constantly explored and subverted for the last 25 years alongside his work as a painter.The new exhibition features a series of small format photographic artworks. Fruit of his inexhaustible impulse to experiment and delve into the elusive medium of photography, these reworked images centre on a resolutely pared-back palette. The understated black and white landscape occasionally embraces hints of coral or salmon. The apparent simplicity of the colour range opens the door wide to some of the metaphysical questions that obsesses the artist: the body and the mystery of the world’s origins. “I’m interested in the idea of building a framework that refers to the female body,” explains François Rouan.Creating these photographic pieces is a complex, tedious process: he lets his models guide the staging phase before playing with techniques such as multiple exposures and photographic braiding, which he then covers with hatching, dots, tracery or tiny commas. The result is dynamic image, swinging between abstraction and figuration. Rouan’s works are strikingly perceptive, resonating with current concerns such as our relationship to images, the other side of the surface, and the role of art in reconstructing a fragmented material and mental world.The exhibition will be marked by the publication of catalogue in May 2024 featuring a text by Agnès Fabre.Born in 1943 in Montpellier, François Rouan lives and works in Laversine (France). From the beginning of his career in the 1960s, he was associated with the Supports/Surfaces movement without being officially affiliated with it. François Rouan has followed a singular path, deconstructing the traditional structure of the painting to open up new avenues in the field of contemporary painting.

He draws on his inexhaustible fund of energy and capacity to transcend linguistic, cultural and geographic boundaries to create visual archives that stand as a personal chronicle of an African-American history rooted in both terror and light, freedom and slavery, racism and humanity, guilt and responsibility. With Afrochemistry, Charles delicately juggles between idea and image to explore the way African-Americans are represented physically and the resulting moral prejudices. The figures depicted in close-up radiate a feeling of depth and truth that has the disconcertingly powerful effect of questioning our perceptions and emotional connection with others. The features Charles gives the faces, as expressive as they are static, not only offer an examination of sensitive social issues but also serve as a catalyst for social change in modern-day America.Born in 1967 in Lafayette, Louisiana, USA, Michael Ray Charles currently lives and works in Austin, Texas, USA, and Gent, Belgium. He spent most of his youth in California and Louisiana. He studied design and advertising for three and a half years before being awarded a BFA degree in 1989. He went on to obtain an MFA in 1993 at the University of Houston, Texas, before teaching at the University of Texas in Austin. In 2014, he joined the faculty of the University of Houston. His work features in a wide range of public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Arizona State University Art Museum and San Antonio Museum of Art in Texas.",Michael Ray Charles: Afrochemistry,"28 rue du Grenier-Saint-Lazare, 75003",Tue-Sat 10am-7pm, 4 May  - 13 Jul 2024  
"Thaddaeus Ropac, Marais",Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/sean-scully-carbon-and-air/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Sean Scully,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/sean-scully/,"This exhibition follows Scully’s recent solo presentation at Houghton Hall, Norfolk, UK, in which his drawings were presented in conversation with his paintings and sculptures. Carbon and Air will run concurrently with a solo presentation of the artist’s work at the Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest, on view until 1 September 2024, featuring several works on paper from the same series, three of which have recently entered the Hungarian National Gallery’s collection. In 2023, Scully began a new series of works in which he reimagines some of the most recognisable compositional motifs of his paintings in pencil on paper. From the densely arranged rectangular forms found in his Wall of Light series to the stacked horizontal structures of his Landline works, these familiar shapes, which are always rooted in the forms he finds in the real world, reemerge in the exhibition through intricate, meditative hatching and shading. One of the first artists to break free of the rigidity of Minimalism, Scully led the transition to a more emotional, impassioned form of abstraction, in which composition is defined by his acutely experienced impressions of the world around him. As such, the recent drawings on view are each named after the date of their making.Though known for his use of colour, monochrome also holds an important place in Scully’s palette. Born in Dublin, Ireland, his family moved when he was four years old to the grey, industrial outskirts of London. In 1975, when he arrived in New York, he began what he has called a ‘five-year love affair with Minimalism’, inspired by the city to reduce his palette back down to these same monochromes in his Black paintings. The pencil drawings on view serve as a reminder of the artist’s relationship to high Minimalism through their formal self-sufficiency, while demonstrating Scully’s masterly ability to convey light in black and white through meticulous shading, creating, as Dávid Fehér, curator of the exhibition at the Hungarian National Gallery, writes, ‘colour without colour’. Like in the drawings of Georges Seurat, an important reference for Scully, densely filled space contrasts with sparser areas in which the individual strokes of his pencil are visible to form compositional structures guided by tone rather than line. The remarkable range he finds within monochrome, meanwhile, is profoundly influenced by the force of ‘the dialectical, or the grey’ in Giorgio Morandi’s work. In some of the drawings on view, the subtle application of blue, purple or red pencil introduces touches of colour.Scully has been working with the geometric grids and blocks that are the ancestors of the works on view since the late 1960s while still a student at Newcastle University in England. However, the exhibition also presents a small selection of figurative drawings from the early 1960s – before the artist entered art school and while he was still working as a typesetter’s apprentice – in which can be found the same attunement to light and dark, portrayed through shading rather than through colour, as is found in the artist’s mature and abstract compositions. In one 1964 work, a pensive figure emerges from a sombre ground created through the application of heavy pencil strokes, the physicality of which is palpable in the finished work. In another drawing from the same decade, delicate, swirling shading forms shadows on the floor in a sun-bathed domestic scene.Drawing has accompanied Scully’s practice as a painter since the beginning of his career, and his works on paper, as Joanna Kleinberg and Brett Littmen, curators of the itinerant 2012–13 survey of Scully’s drawings which concluded at The Drawing Center, New York, wrote, ‘both paraphrase and diversify the ideas in his canvases’. Conceived as a development or extension of existing motifs – as ‘stripping the motifs bare’, as Dávid Fehér writes – rather than as studies or preliminary sketches for his paintings, the artist’s drawings turn the often implied hierarchical relationship between the two mediums on its head. Harnessing the intimacy of drawing, Scully brings his familiar typologies of work to their purest conclusion to portray the essence at the heart of the compositions he returns to again and again. About the artistBorn in Dublin, then raised in London, Scully studied at Croydon School of Art from 1965 as a mature student, and then Newcastle University from 1968, where he began experimenting with abstraction. During a trip to Morocco in 1969, he was strongly influenced by the rich colours of the region, which he translated into the broad horizontal stripes and deep earth tones that characterise his mature style. Following fellowships in 1972 and 1975 at Harvard University, he permanently relocated to New York. From 1980, he made the first of several influential trips to Mexico. The experience had a decisive effect on him and prompted his decision to move from Minimalism to a more emotional and humanistic form of abstraction. It was while in Mexico working in watercolour in 1984 that he made the first Wall of Light, inspired by the patterns of light and shadows he saw on the stacked stones of ancient walls, but it was not until 14 years later, in 1998, following additional trips to Mexico, that Scully began to create his landmark Wall of Light series. These works were shown in 2005–07 at The Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.; Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas; Cincinnati Art Museum, Ohio; and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. In recent years, Scully has also increasingly turned to sculpture, creating monumental structures that engage with the unique energy and history of their locations. As in his paintings, these sculptures feature individual rectangular sections that slot together, maintaining his ongoing interest in interlocking brick forms.Scully’s work has been exhibited in prestigious institutions worldwide, including the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Paris; Museo de Arte Moderno, Mexico City; Museum of Modern Art, New York; National Gallery, London; National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin; Philadelphia Museum of Art; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh; Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.; and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, among others. In 2015 he was the first Western artist to receive a major retrospective at the Shanghai Himalayas Museum and at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing. An exhibition of Scully’s sculptures, paintings and drawings took place at Houghton Hall in Norfolk, UK, in 2023. Solo presentations of the artist’s work are currently on view at the Ludwig Museum, Koblenz, Germany, until 16 June 2024; and at the Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest, until 1 September 2024. From 21 June 2024, monumental works by Scully will be on view in the Église Saint-Nicolas, Caen, France, as part of the Normandie Impressioniste festival, and from 22 June 2024, Château d'Oiron, Plaine-et-Vallées, France will be exhibiting the artist’s sculpture, painting and works on paper. A permanent monumental stone tower sculpture, commissioned by the Centre des monuments nationaux, will be installed at Château d’Oiron later this year.",Sean Scully: Carbon and Air,"7 rue Debelleyme, 75003",Tue-Sat 10am-7pm, 24 May  - 27 Jul 2024  
"Thaddaeus Ropac, Pantin",Paris,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/alex-katz-60-years-of-printmaking/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Alex Katz,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/alex-katz/,"This comprehensive survey of Katz’s printmaking is bookended by defining early prints that shaped the development of the artist’s practice and by arresting works made within the last year that demonstrate his continuing desire to innovate more than six decades into his career. One of the works on view, Luna Park 1, was the very first print Katz made with a print house in 1965. The artist had begun experimenting sporadically with printmaking in the 1950s, making etchings, linoleum cuts and stencils, before abandoning the medium for a decade, only to return to it in the 1960s, when the Pop Art movement, to which Katz was an important precursor and contributor, was broadening definitions of artmaking to include mechanical reproduction and rendering techniques. As Katz puts it, ‘there was a place in the world for prints’.Since 1965, printmaking has continuously held an important place at the heart of Katz’s practice, and reveals a more collected, measured side to his artmaking. In his canvases painted from life, often en plein air, in the manner of the Impressionists, he is known for his ability to encapsulate his fleeting impression of a scene through quick, syncopated brushwork and a wet-on-wet technique, where the entire composition must be finished before the first layer has time to dry. The process of making a print, on the other hand, requires more intention and calculation, making for compositions that the artist describes as more ‘stabilised’ than his paintings. As such, printmaking has often served, for the artist, as a means to develop, refine and reflect on the motifs in his paintings.The works in the exhibition represent familiar imagery from across key facets of his practice, from closely cropped, cinematic portraits to glinting seascapes and leafy landscapes depicted with defined horizon lines and an extraordinary economy of means. Over the course of the artist’s career, printmaking has also served as a springboard for encountering new technical challenges and, by confronting them, achieving new results. His early experiments in silkscreening, which harnessed the medium’s predisposition to a crisp articulation of forms through two-dimensional expanses of single colours, influenced Katz’s use of planes of flat colour atop monochrome backgrounds in his paintings, which have become characteristic of his style.From the mid-1960s onwards, Katz increasingly portrayed groups of figures from the social world that surrounded him in New York. Among the works on view is an important grouping of portfolios made across the course of the 1970s and 80s and into the 90s, which bear witness to his friendships and long-time collaborations with second-generation New York School artists, poets, choreographers and dancers. The portfolios function like vignettes, both in the graphic sense, with Katz experimenting with ways to dissimulate the hard edges of his aquatints like Francisco Goya before him, and the narrative sense, representing momentary observations of the people around him and demonstrating the artist’s lifelong devotion to depicting scenes of vernacular contemporary American life.Although widely known for his use of colour, Katz began printing in black and white in the early 1970s, a practice he has continued until the present day. Several of the most recent works in the exhibition testify to the importance of monochrome in his printmaking practice. Monumental black and white silkscreens and linoleum cuts from over the course of the last decade depict figures in high contrast, several of them inspired by crowds of shoppers. Hung on end walls, these works play on the visitor’s sightlines to surround them on all sides with faces as if in a bustling crowd, a sensation amplified by the stand-alone cutout figures that punctuate the exhibition. Katz first began making cutouts in 1959 as a way to restructure the relationship between figure and background. Suspended between painting and sculpture, they exist on a two-dimensional plane, epitomising the artist’s characteristic flat aesthetic, but occupy the exhibition in three dimensions, lending it a sense of depth and movement and encouraging visitors to interrogate the way they perceive works of art in space.",Alex Katz: 60 Years of Printmaking,"69 avenue Général Leclerc, 93500",Tue-Sat 10am-7pm, 25 May  - 23 Jul 2024
