And the responsibility of being human comes from telling the story behind each word, so that there is no mistake in what is meant. For more than half a century, Nil Yalter’s work has been dedicated to uncovering the strength, resilience and hope that makes this fragile, intricate core, through stories of people that keep the world running with a deep critique of intersectional injustice. She has woven these stories with elements she borrowed from the ancient oral and visual traditions of Anatolia and codes of modernism she felt close to. The Story Behind Each Word Must Be Told focuses on one of the central threads of Yalter’s practice coming from the nomadic lives and their resistance in Aşık tradition in Anatolia for centuries: the word and the utterance, its sound and its music. From Topak Ev (1973) to D’Après Stimmung (1973), Shaman (1979), Exile is A Hard Job - Estranged Doors (1983) to Pixelismus (La Chora) (1993), Sound of Painting (2008) and Lord Byron Meets Shaman Woman (2009), she deals with the word and its intricate utterance in visual and oral forms.The Story Behind Each Word Must Be Told is inspired by the LP vinyl record “le chant des troubadours de turquie: Achik Nesimi” that Nil Yalter produced in collaboration with Bernard Dupaigne for Aşık Nesimi Çimen in 1979, who was at that time in exile in Paris. Born in Adana, Turkey, in 1931, Nesimi was the master of cura as one of the leading bards of his generation that connected the centuries old Aşık tradition with contemporary issues and struggles of his time. The exhibition also involves a performative element, a music and word-based gathering tributing Aşık Nesimi and his special friendship with Yalter as part of London Gallery Weekend.ARTIST BIOGRAPHYNil Yalter (b.1938, Cairo, Egypt), lives and works in Paris. A pioneer in the French feminist art movement of the 1970s, Yalter was educated at Robert College, the prestigious American secondary educational institution in Istanbul. While she was engaged in dance, theatre and painting during this time, she also practised pantomime and travelled by foot to India as a pantomime artist. Yalter has lived in Paris since 1965. She participated in the French counter culture and revolutionary political movement of the late 1960s, immersing herself in the debates around gender, migrant workers from Turkey, and other issues of the time. These social movements and ethnographic science have influenced the artist’s videos, performances and installations from the 1970s in the form of an idiosyncratic, pluralistic aesthetics. The influence of abstract traditions, especially that of Russian constructivism can be observed in her paintings and digital works since her early years. Nil Yalter’s works reflect a style that blends together all these influences along with autobiographical elements where the personal and the political intertwine.Nil Yalter is the recipient of the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement of the Venice Biennale 2024. Her works are part of institutional collections such as the Tate Modern, the Centre Pompidou, the Ludwig Museum and the Long Beach Museum, among others, as well as private collections such as the Art Collection Telecom, Colección Olor Visual, Reydan Weiss Collection and Fundación Foto Colectania. She has participated in international art fairs such as Art Basel Basel, ARCO Madrid, Art Cologne, FIAC, Frieze Masters, Armory Show, Frieze y Frieze NY, to cite a few, as well as the 10th Gwangju Biennial in 2014, the 15th Sharjah Biennial in 2023, the 13th Istanbul Biennial in 2013 and selected for the 60th Venice Biennale. Among her most recent solo exhibitions stand out examples such the ones at the Museum Ludwig, the MAC-VAL and the Hessel Museum of Art in 2019, the FRAC Lorraine and the ARTER space for art in Istanbul in 2016, and the ones at the Centre Pompidou in 2012 and 2010.

She paints towards the liberation of women, symbolically connecting this emancipation with the growth and persistence of the natural world. The women in her paintings, semi-mythical images of bravery and power, stare boldly back at their viewer. The flowers, leaves, and twisting stems represent the vital force within us, and the promise of flourishing blossoms when adequately nourished and nurtured. Sometimes these natural elements come from memories or stories, which interweave her personal relationships into the narratives of the works.Her art is as socially engaged as it is poetic. She explores themes of peace and freedom in the context of ongoing war in her home country of Sudan. The nation-wide war in Sudan has now been waging for over a year, displacing millions and pushing the country to the brink of famine. Hymns of Peace visualises this conflict, and seeks a better outcome. The artworks in this collection become like seeds, planting alternative visions for a positive future.Amel’s artistic practice brings together pointillism, intricate ink drawings, and painting. Meticulous and methodical, Bashier applies thousands of small dots from the nib of her pen to create an imperceptibly solid composition. This meditative practice also offers her personal catharsis from the traumas endured by her homeland.Amel Bashier (b. 1981) was born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and spent her childhood between Jeddah and Port Sudan in Sudan, on the Red Sea. While she is now based in Paris, her intricate pointillist paintings draw inspiration from the strength and wisdom of her female ancestors, particularly those who fought and struggled for their rights.

Through Brett’s collection, we encounter his constant curiosity and insight accompanied by a disinterest in a market-led view. In this exhibition, we can experience Brett’s hope and belief in the ability of art to let us begin again.Following an encounter in Paris in 1964 with Brazilian artist Sérgio Camargo (1930- 1990), whose disruption of the monochrome is seen through three works included in the exhibition, Brett became particularly interested in developments in Brazilian modernism. This was solidified by his first visit to Brazil in 1965, aged just 22-years-old, to view the São Paulo Biennial as art critic for The Times. There, he encountered artists including Lygia Clark (1920-1988) and Hélio Oiticica (1937-1980), with whom he formed close friendships and whose international reputations are owed in part to Brett’s rigorous, lifelong advocacy. Both artists are significantly represented in this exhibition: Clark’s rare and playful matchbox constructions, as well as her bichos (creatures) and trepantes (climbers), invite audience participation, as does Oiticica’s Parangolé (1966), an experimental cloak intended to be worn by dancing participants. What drew Brett to the work of artists like Oiticica and Clark was a faith in regeneration, in a creative practice that exceeds the body, that both reflects the conditions of the outside world and suggests that another world is possible.Throughout his career, Guy Brett focused on discovering and exhibiting works that were excluded from Eurocentric art historical chronologies. While the British art world at the time cast their gaze towards white male American Pop art and Abstract expressionism, Brett turned his attention to experimental art movements, particularly those originating from Latin America. In a characteristically trailblazing manner, Brett was one of the earliest champions of pioneering women artists.Brett was integral to the Signals initiative, co-publishing the Signals Newsbulletin in 1964 and helping to establish the now legendary gallery, Signals London (1964-66), which manifested an interdisciplinary approach and brought artists to London from across the world. Brett’s ground-breaking 1990 exhibition, Transcontinental: Nine Latin American Artists (Cornerhouse, Manchester and Ikon Gallery, Birmingham), introduced artists including Cildo Meireles (b.1948), Regina Vater (b.1943), Eugenio Dittborn (b.1943) and Jac Leirner (b.1961) to the UK. The same works by Vater and Leirner that featured in Transcontinental, Vater’s Nature Morte (1987-1988) and Leirner’s The One Hundreds (Signatures) (1987), are shown in this current exhibition. Brett described Transcontinental as encompassing ‘the relation, the tension, between the abstract/void and the contingent, localised, historical, urgent and conflicted’.This exhibition would not have been possible without the collaboration of Alexandra Brett, Guy’s long-time partner with whom he shared his life and built his collection. Alison Jacques is immensely grateful to Alexandra and her daughter, Luciana, for the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to present this historically significant collection. Above all, we are indebted to Guy Brett. We hope this exhibition can play a part in continuing to preserve Brett’s art historical and ever-prescient legacy.",Angel with a Gun: Homage to Guy Brett,"22 Cork Street, W1S 3LZ",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 10 May  - 15 Jun 2024

Composed as a temple to eroticism, it explores and universalises the many complex paradoxes of Ishtar, the ancient Mesopotamian goddess of both love and war, as well as fertility and sensuality. As the goddess of paradox, Ishtar is the model of unity in multiplicity.Each of us reflects some of her discordance in ourselves, and this exhibition, Whole Cookie, explores how we strive to gather these conflicting parts into a semblance of order. Ishtar’s polarities and contradictions feed the creative spirit, but they also provoke insecurity and disruption. She represents chaos, going against order and principle, however this also opens up to possibility and potential. The destructive and harsh in balance with the empowering and transformative; society coexisting side by side with the cosmic.Upon entering the exhibition, visitors are faced with the painted image of a sphinx, the guardian of the temple – and its riddle:MINA (reads): ‘Poor is the man whose pleasures depend on the permissions of another’?SPHINX: It’s a Madonna quote. From ‘Justify My Love’... Can we call room service?MINA: Gosh, yes, I remember the video. Rather a Helmut Newton pornographic soiree situation.SPHINX: So sick, yeah. I think I was conceived to that, maybe? (Laughs) In the desert.MINA: Your father was a lion and your mother was an eagle owl— correct?[Excerpt from an accompanying text written by Charlie Fox]In Karkar’s method of seeing others in the show exploring the interaction between humans and hybrid figures. Her gestural work is imbued with colour relationships, as expressed by a vibrant palette in which her bodies are twisted and blended in a dance macabre that evoke the work of Egon Schiele.Ana Karkar’s work is influenced by cinematography and images in the collective unconscious, especially horror and erotic movies. Filmic elements are often noted in her paintings, however for this show, for the first time Karkar is exhibiting film work, in the video piece Queen of the Night in relation to her painting. This then takes its title from a particular terracotta relief from the Old Babylonian period, from Mesopotamia (now at the British Museum).Pervaded by ancient symbolism alongside post-Punk elements and underground culture references, the film tells the story of the divinely complex marriage of Ishtar and Dumuzi and is set to the soundtrack of Berlin-based band Noj remixed to the Witch house genre, in a track titled “Cleopatra’s Nose”.Like an altar, the film is presented as the backdrop to Karkar’s own sculpture of a goddess, subversively titled Queen of the Nightlife, under whose feet is positioned a text written by Karim Massoteau, MY ANGER, A HARROW WITH GREAT TEETH, HAS TORN THE MOUNTAIN APART, folded and marked ‘REUNIFICATION IN PROCESS’. Visitors can take a copy of this text with them as they leave the altar.“Now clad in terror, opening her chest, she demands the destruction of the mountain but is met only with resounding silence.Whiffs of Cypress and Cedar are smelled.Fist clenched, she then summons all life in her body and weaves a storm, fury assembles in her heart, her folds, her veins, her very blood, and lava dribbling from her lips, unleashes the shockwaves of her orgasm all around.She blows one blast of pitiless, pulsing, stroboscopic, energy.”[An excerpt from Karim Massoteau's text]Ana Karkar, via Ishtar, is insisting we face our shadowy contradictions. That we acknowledge who we are, in all our painful and wonderful complexity. At the same time, she steps forward to do the same.------INTERVIEW WITH A SPHINXBy Mina HarkerSPHINX: Did you see my new tattoo, Mina? It tickled.MINA: They’ve just sent some rather fun questions for you... Favourite scent?SPHINX: Cake. So it goes from my wing, around the belly to the top of my tail.MINA (reads): ‘Poor is the man whose pleasures depend on the permissions of another’?SPHINX: It’s a Madonna quote. From ‘Justify My Love’... Can we call room service?MINA: Gosh, yes, I remember the video. Rather a Helmut Newton pornographic soiree situation.SPHINX: So sick, yeah. I think I was conceived to that, maybe? (Laughs) In the desert.MINA: Your father was a tiger and your mother was an eagle owl— correct?SPHINX: You’re so clever, Mina, yeah! And they had me, lucky fuckers. Flew straight from my mum’s belly, looked at my wings in the mirror, cried some diamonds. I am so hungry. I’m phoning for some pancakes.MINA: Was it disturbing, discovering that you weren’t like other girls or boys?SPHINX: Being in a body is always disturbing, nope? It’s a never- ending disturbance. Hormones and growth spurts and mood swings. I guess I should’ve been self-harming in a graveyard, ripping my heart out. Blood always gets me hot, actually. And bones.MINA: If I get too... hot and bothered, I fetch the opium. Did you enjoy Eyes Wide Shut?SPHINX: I mean, I’ve been to those rituals and it was a lot sexier, but, yeah, it’s a great Xmas movie. Well done, Stan.MINA: I enjoy a mask... the mystery.SPHINX: I liked a lot, actually, my body. Having this weird thing nobody else had. Like a rose. And tiger-stripes on my back.MINA: I must confess when I saw a tiger at the Zoological Gardens in London once, I did feel a quiver.SPHINX: Lay the pancakes down there, thank you, baby! Boys are my favourite food, really. You should’ve banged that tiger, Mina! You banged a wolf.MINA: Yes, well, we all have a past. Favourite erotic film?SPHINX: Aw, Forbidden Tales! People are scared of themselves. Scared of what they want. It’s all kind of tragic.MINA: Perhaps the refusal intensifies the urge...SPHINX: Maybe. I think it’s like a big party and being offered swan to eat and then just saying, Oh, I’ll take this feather.MINA: But a swan feather caressed upon a delicate area of flesh is —SPHINX: Like, I broke into this mausoleum with a redhead girl once. Like that Joy Division album cover or whatever? Anyway, she kissed me while we were lying on the slab...MINA: Sphinx, my love! Think of the cadavers, the ghosts —SPHINX: Shut up, they would’ve clapped! That cold marble on my fur. Miaow. And it was so dark in there. Nice and dark and warm.MINA: Houdini’s ghost did visit me once, unstitched my corset. SPHINX: Rather naughty. There’s a jungle growling in my belly. MINA: Forgive my blushes. Celebrity crush?SPHINX: Hunter Schafer: no question.MINA: Do you believe in good and evil?SPHINX: Who came up with that? We need to be pals with our demons and angels and hang out with them and feed each other grapes.MINA: Like a splendid Titian.SPHINX: Yeah? Or more Bacon vibe, maybe. MINA: Favourite body part?SPHINX: On me? Oooh, my wings. I like having someone nestled in there, all cosy. Hold them tight.MINA: On someone else?SPHINX: All of it, especially the earlobe. Mina, come and have some food, please.MINA: Dark honey from the continent! Marvelous. Last dream you had?SPHINX: Ooh, I was looking at this pool of flesh on a marble floor, all red and bloody and sparkling like treasure.MINA: Crumbs. SPHINX: I know.— Charlie Fox, artist, writer and curatorAna Karkar is a French-American artist who has lived and worked in Paris for many years. Karkar draws some of her references from major works of the Vienna Secession. In her paintings of nudes, the bodies are twisted and blended in a danse macabre that evokes the work of Egon Schiele, or are joined in passionate freedom, recalling Gustav Klimt’s iconic painting The Kiss.Karkar’s mastery of gesture is evident in her exploration of the interaction between abstraction and figuration, between humans and hybrid figures. Her work is imbued with color relationships, as expressed by a vibrant palette surrounded with blue that captures the eye of the visitor.The chiaroscuro in her works evokes cinematographic scenes. Her art is influenced by images in the collective unconscious, especially experimental horror cinema. The artist skillfully combines these cinematographic elements with her own artistic language, creating a captivating visual dialogue.",Ana Karkar: Whole Cookie,"Broadbent House, W1K 3JH",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 30 May  - 27 Jul 2024

Your studies of the interplay of human motives and emotion.”— Isaac Asimov, I, RobotAsimov’s seminal story is about the allure and potential ramifications of perfecting humanity through sentient technology—what we now call post-human or transhumanism. And like all of the finest works of science fiction, the book is at heart a philosophical tract. Questioning key assumptions about the nature of life itself, through a discourse with the consciousness of advanced robots, Asimov ultimately queries what it is to be human. For the past four decades, the acclaimed Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama has been asking the same questions.Sorayama’s ongoing Sexy Robots series ponders the alluring, intimidating imaginary of a cyborg human, merging woman and droid, fleshy anatomy and flashy armor, in a cheeky and unsettling continuum from the Hollywood pin-up to the fantastical future. In his finely rendered, sleek and striking mixed media works on canvas—themselves a seamless hybrid of digital and analog mediums—and his iconic sculptural works in steel, Sorayama channels aesthetic visions from Bert Stern to Mel Ramos, Brancusi to Rolls Royce, Egypt to the Oscars.Throughout his decades-long career, Sorayama has seen the world change around him—or rather, catch up with him. His visionary early art practice—as well as his award-winning robotics design work— now seem prescient. But in balance with the narrative and symbolic pull of the futuristic transmogrifications, the materiality of the works and their compositional lexicon complexifies that vector. By drawing on centuries and even millennia-old painting conventions, from mythic maidens and goddesses of ancient Greece and the Renaissance to the glamor photography of Hollywood’s Golden Age and the Barbarella-esque fantasy of the erotic future, Sorayama contextualizes his entreprise within an array of cultural settings. However, he in turn disrupts this legacy with the introduction of digital print and photographic elements, so that the works, in their physical form, embody the same kind of hybridity as his subjects and his ideas.His work is animated by both erotic nostalgia and aspirational futurism. Through acrylic and digital print works on canvas, Sorayama portrays sexualized archetypes of Western feminine beauty and power (Marilyn Monroe, Joan of Arc, Jane Russell; mermaids, goddesses, muses) with an inside-out take on the art history of the male gaze. Call it the sexuality of the singularity, but consider, as the artist does, whether it becomes more or less complex to engage the post-human woman, the cyborg female, as an object of fear and desire?Furthermore, the works ask us to consider the traditional and subverted status of beauty in art and in sexuality—and to what degree beauty even means the same thing to humans and robots.What is more beautiful—the impossibly smooth metal or the softness of plump flesh? The flaws that make an individual, or the attainment of a flawless uniformity? What if the most beautiful being was also the most fearsome—the hybrid, the otherworldly, the both? What if all of this soul-seeking philosophy becomes clouded by the heady rush of physical attraction? When you want them, what do you really want, exactly? What if it’s all a trap?Sorayama lives and works in Tokyo, Japan, his birthplace and where he graduated from Tokyo’s Chubi Central Art School. His time in Hollywood and especially his work in science fiction graphics, became the inspiration for his iconic work, the internationally acclaimed Sexy Robot series, which has been running since 1978. Featured in permanent collections such as the Museum of Modern Art (New York) and the Smithsonian Institution (Washington, DC), he is the rare artist who is equally celebrated by prestigious institutions, fashion houses, erotic publications, as well as the multi-national technology corporations.— Shana Nys Dambrot, art critic, curator, and author","Hajime Sorayama: I, Robot","Broadbent House, W1K 3JH",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 30 May  - 27 Jul 2024

Among this dynamic list of artists is Michael Craig-Martin. Widely regarded as a pioneering figure of British conceptual art, Craig-Martin’s images expose the tensions between objects and their representations, highlighting the subtle relationships between perception, language, and meaning. Alongside Craig-Martin’s Untitled (violin fragment blue) is Alexander Calder’s Plumbings II, in which kinetic and geometric shapes transform everyday objects into a vibrant existence.YBA artist Gavin Turk will exhibit a highlight of his new series of still-life paintings, depicting today’s quotidian product that serves as a response to a still-life painting by Polish artist Henri Hayden.Another highlight of the exhibition is by Turner Prize winner Keith Tyson, whose artistic philosophy rejects the notion of a fixed self or a singular artistic style. Tyson engages with the work of Roberto Matta, an influential figure in 20th-century Abstract Expressionism and Surrealism from Chile. This encounter between two visionary artists promises to ignite new possibilities and challenge traditional artistic boundaries.Danish artist Tal R, renowned for his exuberant and direct painting style that effortlessly bridges the realms of high art and childlike simplicity, finds an intriguing counterpart in the work of the revered 20th-century Jewish artist: Marc Chagall. Tal R's sophisticated, yet naive approach bears resemblances to the works found within Chagall's iconic oeuvre.Renowned British painter Richard Wathen, known for his fictional portraits that evoke ambiguity, mystery, and a sense of melancholia, responds to an enigmatic work by the Belgian Surrealist artist Paul Delvaux. This encounter between two distinct artistic visions invites viewers into a world of introspection and contemplation.Chinese artist Wen Wu, whose paintings draw inspiration from literature and Asian culture, responds to a painting by the Italian 19th-century artist Vittorio Reggianini. Both works explore similar themes of exploration, wisdom, and elegance.The exhibition also features the vibrant and playful sculptural works of Egyptian-born British sculptor Sam Shendi, who responds to an iconic mother and child sculpture by Henry Moore. Shendi's semi-abstracted style and bold use of colour injects a fresh perspective into Moore's timeless masterpiece.British contemporary artist Von Wolfe skilfully navigates the intersection between traditional oil painting and cutting-edge technological innovations in response to a work by the pioneering Impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir.Emma Bennett, a contemporary artist whose work delves into the themes of time, transience, and fragmented memory, engages with the artistry of Salvador Dali. Zavier Ellis, whose works are informed by historical events and belief systems, responds to a work by Pablo Picasso.Born in London to Chinese parents, contemporary multimedia artist Gordon Cheung blurs the lines between virtual and tangible reality, delving into existential questions about identity, belonging, and territory. Similarly, Tsuguharu Foujita, born in Japan and later a French citizen, explores the same notions. Despite working in different centuries, both artists grapple with these timeless questions in their respective bodies of work.The exhibition also showcases the groundbreaking digital art of multimedia and creative technologist Scott Eaton, responding to the spiritually-charged sculptures of Spanish artist Jaume Plensa. Eaton's innovative approach merges technology and art, creating a dialogue between the digital and tactile realms.Art Through Time: Contemporary Reflections emphasises the significance of contemporary art in today's world and celebrates the evolution of artistic expression. While contemporary artists explore similar subject matters as their predecessors, they introduce new realities, sensibilities, and colour palettes. This exhibition serves as a lens to history through art, reminding us that while the past informs our present, we have made substantial progress, learned invaluable lessons, and now inhabit distinct realities.",Art Through Time: Contemporary Reflections,"27 Cork Street, W1S 3NG",Mon-Fri 9am-6pm, 3 Apr  - 31 May 2024

The results – metaphors for what lies beyond language and the other side of silence – were quieter than my other recent work. By contrast, my White Rock tea bowls were experiments in the very opposite direction. I left nothingness behind me and sought to recapture beauty. Colours gushed into empty white space. I made these more expressionistic tea bowls not in response to Berg but in homage to Takemitsu. His world is one in which a single sound rings out in a white void. In its solitariness it is intensely personal. As it reverberates in the emptiness it draws out a new sound. The sounds hover before merging. Further sounds arise and merge with the others, thereby creating a diffuse, layered sonic structure. Takemitsu’s single sound gradually expands until it echoes throughout the world. It makes one think of blowing wind or seeping water or droplets of rain. Takemitsu’s spirit releases itself from the confines of individuality into time-space. The freedom it finds is ruthless and resolute. Takemitsu’s highly evolved aesthetic is one of supreme serenity and delicacy. It is born of his individual existence pitching itself against and struggling with the world. With my White Rock tea bowls I have sought to fuse my soul with Takemitsu’s unique sound and free myself into a space of unrelenting whiteness.”Raku tea bowls were first made in Japan’s historical capital of Kyoto by a potter named Chōjirō in the sixteenth century. Shaped by hand (rather than thrown) and taken out of the kiln whilst glowing hot, their purpose was for drinking whipped tea (matcha) in the tea ceremony (chanoyu). These monochrome red or black Raku tea bowls were considered radically modern and synonymous with the ideals of wabicha tea ceremonies, with their emphasis on simplicity. Chōjirō is celebrated as the founder and first-generation head of the Raku dynasty of tea bowl makers (chawanya), who have lived and worked in Kyoto since 1586. Raku Jikinyū is the 15th descendant and heads of the Raku family have traditionally taken the first name Kichizaemon when succeeding to the family headship. In 2019 Raku Jikinyū’s son Atsundo became the head of the family and became Raku Kichizaemon XVI.Raku Jikinyū was born in Kyoto in 1949 and studied sculpture at Tokyo University of the Arts, he then travelled to Italy, basing himself in Rome for two years while travelling around Europe. His resolve on returning to Japan was to pursue his own creative interests while working alongside his father, the 14th generation head of the family, to learn the skills of how to make and fire Raku tea bowls.“I have chosen to devote myself to the making of tea bowls. Tea bowls incorporate the unusual sense of space and time of chanoyu in their very forms. However, tea bowls serve a far more profound purpose. Despite the restrictions governing their format, they have the capacity to contain the fervour of the artist’s quest to influence the world and his inner striving … A world where the ritualistic and the ordinary meet, a world situated at the point of contact between the usual and the extraordinary, between reality and non-reality, the inner adventure of the individual leaping towards totality yet remaining within the mundane - such are the strange qualities of chanoyu (the tea ceremony).”The exhibition will comprise 15 White Rock tea bowls and 15 Black Rock tea bowls and occupy the 4th floor gallery space.

I think music and sculpture for me are the flow of these.”Air Recycle is a unique installation created by Nakajima on our 3rd floor gallery space specifically for this exhibition. Her working process is intuitive and improvised with different objects taking on their own characteristics, often randomly, and in reaction to each other. In her works, Nakajima incorporates many found and reclaimed materials including paper tubes, buttons, strings, tin, sticks, bicycle tubes, lids and jars, steel wire and electronics to power them. She envisages motors rotating papers, scratching walls and hitting steel wire, others rotating metal sticks that ring against bottles, pencils and sticks that hit and draw on walls or objects with fast, slow and soft movements. The direction and nature of the work is not pre-determined but sound is always a key element in responding to the space and interactions of her materials. Whether these compositions are across the floor, wall-mounted or freestanding, Nakajima’s installations spontaneously emerge, comprising a multitude of individual yet connected components.Nakajima refers to her work as both sculpture and music, both are central elements in her work with some projects focussing more on music and sound art and others more on sculptural pieces. In 2023, Nakajima performed with Pierre Berthet in Milly-la-Forêt in France, on the site of Jean Tinguely’s sculpture Le Cyclop. “I don’t care much for what is art or music... It’s just a situation. If I’m in a musical context – a concert or festival – I gather information from my past and try to make something more interesting than before”. Nakajima sees her work in terms of accumulated knowledge that is collected over time with improvisation being an opportunity for this knowledge to express itself.As part of the quartet O YAMA O, Nakajima has performed frequently at Café Oto - an EastLondon venue synonymous with experimental music and sound art - with its co-founder Keiko Yamamoto whom she met at Chelsea College of Arts. O YAMA O’s improvised performances combine Yamamoto’s singing – touching on subjects derived from Japanese folklore and domestic life – with Nakajima’s kinetic objects. Nakajima summons delicate textures out of her objects, slowly shaping the music into what appears to be a choreographed crescendo but is in essence a largely improvised ritual.In his essay ‘Trembling Between States: Rie Nakajima”, David Toop, another collaborator of Nakajima, writes: “Where we listen; how we listen. These two elements form a sculptural reality in relation to the object of sounding. The object of sounding is indifferent. There is its place in a room but when listening begins there is no object, no room - only the sculptural reality created by the listener.”Rie Nakajima studied at Tokyo University of the Arts, Faculty of Fine Arts, Aesthetics and Art History Department in 2000, then in London at Chelsea College of Arts BA in Fine Arts in 2002 at Chelsea College of Arts in London, and an MFA in Sculpture at the Slade School of Art in 2007.Her first major solo exhibition was held at IKON Gallery in Birmingham in 2018. She has also worked with Museo Vostell Malpartida (Cáceres), Association de Le Cyclop (Milly la Forêt), ShugoArts (Tokyo), Donaueschinger Music Festival (Donaueschinger), and Cafe OTO (London). Her collaborations have included working with Pierre Berthet, David Cunningham, Keiko Yamamoto, Miki Yui, Hans.W.Koch, Marie Roux, Akio Suzuki + Aki Onda Billy Steiger, David Toop and Akira Sakata amongst others. Public Gallery projects and exhibitions have included Museu de Arte Moderna, Rio de Janeiro; Embassy of Belgium and Hara Museum, Tokyo; Kunsthaus Wiesbaden, Germany; Serpentine Gallery, Tate, Camden Art Centre, Southbank Gallery, London. She has also contributed to multi-media collaborative works online including music and video.",Rie Nakajima: Air Recycle,"23 Dering Street, W1S 1AW","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 16 May  - 6 Jul 2024  
Artist Room,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/leonardo-devito-tired-city/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",The Artist Room,https://www.galleriesnow.net/gallery/the-artist-room,"It’s difficult to imagine ever getting used to living in a city like Florence. A city where one can walk to Piazza del Duomo and see Giotto’s Bell Tower rising from the ground, or walk alongside the river Arno as the warm sun shines on the Ponte Vecchio. A city where the museums house paintings by Botticelli, Caravaggio, and Raphael as well as sculptures by Bernini and Michelangelo. A city where almost every corner is a feast for one’s eyes. For Leonardo Devito, this was his everyday reality while he grew up immersed in Florence’s rich artistic history.“I didn’t look at contemporary art when I was studying at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence,” Devito tells me from his Turin studio, as he prepares himself for a trip to the Venice Biennale the next day. “I looked at what was around me. Artists working at the beginning of the Quattrocento like Fra Angelico and Piero della Francesca helped form my thinking. They have become ever present in my work, almost part of my subconscious.” In Rogo [Fire] (2024), one of Devito’s paintings on view in Tired City, his second solo exhibition at The Artist Room, a man is splayed on the ground, sleeping while appearing to ignore the burning city behind him. Devito’s use of strong shadows and harsh corners echoes the convergent perspectives used by artists from the Renaissance like Giotto to render the perspective of the city. “I don’t do this on purpose,” he observes. “Sometimes, I only realise after I finish a painting that what I was making recalls a certain image that I may have seen in the past, a hidden memory from earlier in life.” The man in Rogo [Fire] is wrapped in a blue sheet, with a soft, darker fabric covering his eyes. After finishing, Devito noticed a connection with Giovanni Bellini’s Drunkenness of Noah (1515) . Differently, I couldn’t help but connect the detailed folds of Devito’s blue fabric with the sculpted marble drapes that wrap the statue of St. Cecilia (1600) by Stefano Maderno in Rome, or the marbled veil covering Giuseppe Sanmartino’s Veiled Christ (1753) in Naples. “It becomes natural for me to get closer to that type of image, one that faintly recalls elements of the Renaissance, the Baroque, or of Italian art history in general. I guess it’s ingrained in me,” Devito adds.“I’m very interested in how artists from the 20th century have reinterpreted the Renaissance, like Felice Casorati, Giorgio de Chirico, and Mario Sironi,” Devito says. “In my practice, I seek a similarly malleable way of creating imaginary worlds that subtly hint at the artistic and architectural landscapes of the past.” While Devito may be reminiscing on the romantic Florentine Renaissance and looking at Italian artists from a more recent past, the paintings featured in Tired City also thread directly into the present through their relation with his own personal experiences. The journey of his exhibition begins with the painting Demiurgo [Demiurge] (2024) which depicts a child holding a leafless tree enclosed within a circular box. “In elementary school, I remember spending lunch breaks with my friends building houses where little gnomes would live,” Devito recollects. “We’d find sticks, put them on the ground, make some holes, and play together pretending that these little gnomes did this and that.” With the tree close to his heart, the boy in Demiurgo [Demiurge] is wrapped in the little world he holds, disregarding the infinite horizon in the background with its mountains, ocean, and rising sun. When asked if the gnomes were actual toys, Devito laughs and says, “No, we’d pretend they existed. It was a moment of shared fantasy creating an imaginary city.” The title of the painting, Demiurgo [Demiurge], stems from the philosophical figure of the ‘demiurge’, the divine artisan and shaper of the universe, first introduced by Plato in Timaeus. Just like the boy in the painting is the demiurge of the little world he holds on to, Devito is the demiurge of the imaginary cities populated by gnomes he and his friends would create at school, and today, of the world he constructs in his practice. Painting by painting, Devito takes us on a journey through a semi-imaginary world, materialising it through the perspective of a child growing up.In Primo Giardino [First Garden], more trees seem to have grown in the enclosed city and are no longer without leaves; yet, they are all translucent and protected by three similarly sheer and small beings standing at the bottom of the frame. “I added those little characters to make the painting less solemn – more playful and whimsical,” Devito explains. “They’re kind of like the little toys you’d find in Kinder Surprise Eggs.” The existence of the three mystical Kinder beings is subtle, because they are shadowed by the imposing cement-like grey walls enclosing the world of trees. Yet, playful references to his childhood experience don't end here. In Tardo Pomeriggio [Late Afternoon] (2024), two teenagers are pictured sitting on a bench, one holding a deck of cards, the other is wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with a faded drawing of a urinating child. Upon closer inspection, the brown spiral on the reverse of the cards recalls Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Cards and the urinating kid recalls the unlicensed Calvin peeing drawing popularly plastered across T-shirts and on cars in the noughties. Devito hints at the specific yet shared playful experience of growing up in the early 2000’s through these details. He brings them in stark contrast with the river that dramatically curves into the horizon with the factory standing behind the adolescents. “It's similar to the factories near my house in the peripheries of Florence,” Devito says. The clash between the factory’s smoke and playful childhood ephemera heightens the nonchalant expressions of the boys as they sit staring blankly at whatever stands in front of them, beyond the frame.A discomforting sensation seems to loom over Devito's paintings through the expressions of his protagonists that collide with what's happening around them. ""I don't like when an image is clearly joyful or clearly sad,"" he adds. ""There has to be a clash between emotions. When that happens, there's an ambiguity that leaves room for something more interesting to be revealed."" This is evidenced in paintings like Ricreazione [Recreation] (2024), where darkness takes over children while playing what's meant to be a fun game during their lunch break. Devito's imagined city becomes an alternate universe where worlds seem to collide.“It's interesting when things from the past find themselves in places that have nothing to do with them, like Derek Jarman’s film Caravaggio (1986),” Devito explains. In the film, Jarman envisions a fictional narrative of the painter’s life including scenes of Caravaggio smoking cigarettes among other contemporary elements that couldn't have existed during his lifetime. Yet, these inclusions are subtle, brief, and don’t feel out of place. “I’m intrigued by this type of collision,” Devito tells me. In Assedio [Siege] (2024), he paints little soldiers shooting rifles to defend a mediaeval castle. The soldiers should feel intrusive and yet, they don’t – they seamlessly integrate with the dramatic scene where a young boy wearing contemporary clothing is about to crash a ship into the castle that they are protecting. The temporal eras from which the soldiers, castle, and boy originate no longer matter in Devito’s surreal whimsical world. Like a frozen snapshot, the focus shifts to impending action.Growing up in Italy, imaginary worlds often crash with reality. “There’s a constant tension between the present and the past in Italian cities, and the permanence of things,” Devito muses. “Genoa’s intrusive cavalcavia for example, the overpasses that cut through the city’s beautiful urban architecture; or Rome, with its construction sites near the Colosseum – one minute, it’s completely frantic, and the next, you are in front of beautiful ruins.” Devito’s Tired City feels like an extension of the Italian city itself, clashing elements that materialise in real life simultaneously form part of a surreal, imaginary world that has been conjured up in Leonardo’s mind growing up as a young boy in Italy. “Connecting these two opposing dimensions, the contrast between modernity and antiquity, plays into a beguiling, fascinating world,” he concludes.Drawing the title of his exhibition from Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities (1972), Devito blends the real with the fantastical, proposing an alternate world where growing up may not necessarily mean living in a more cynical environment. Similarly to how Calvino takes the real historical figure of Marco Polo to imagine cities in Kublai Khan's empire, Devito bridges how Italian history has been conceived in our collective memories with his contemporary personal experience to construct the Tired City.Since moving to Turin in 2020, where he is now surrounded by contemporary art, Devito's Tired City becomes a project of looking back, a coming together of collective memories, fictional fantasies, and lived, personal experience. “All of life seems to be rich and full of possibilities when you’re a child, all beautiful, joyful, and infinite,” Devito says. “Then you grow up and all that fantasy seems to catch on fire and disappear.” The journey across the Tired City ends with Bobi fa pipì [Bobi Pee] (2024) where two older men look over the wall to see the last few remains of their imagined city. The only thing left is a barren tree with a black dog cheekily urinating on the wall beside it. “There are bound to be a few remains of the purity of childhood and adolescence that still exist deep down in these two figures,” Devito reflects. They’re no longer as nonchalant as they were while watching children build their city, or as bored as they were when they were teenagers watching their city burn. Instead, their facial expressions have been replaced by dramatic shock. All it took for their indifference to disappear was for them to grow old and for a dog to foul within the walls of their imagined city.Text by Sara Quattrocchi Febles.",Leonardo Devito: Tired City,"20 Great Chapel Street, W1F 8FW","Wed-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 12-5pm", 31 May  - 29 Jun 2024

He is noted for his excessive use of simple algorithmic rules. It was in the early 90s, while finishing his studies in Boston, that he encountered digital artistic tools, prompting a transition from painting to algorithms upon returning to France. Since then, he has created environments marked by excess, repetition and the unpredictability of technological processes, in which he aims to engage the viewers by questioning perception in relation to space, time and language. He develops multi-referential works which play with spatial environments and promote multiple interpretations. Recent exhibitions include Artists & Robots at the Grand Palais in Paris (2018), Cybernetic Consciousness at Itaú cultural in São Paulo (2017) and the Venice Biennale (2013). In 2020, he achieved the creation of a permanent public artwork, Double Connection, nearly one hundred meters long in the center of Shanghai.

The paintings on show demonstrate the artist’s tireless conviction in the poetics of abstraction, as well as the gradual adoption of a looser, more essential visual language influenced by Japanese calligraphy.Through vivid gestural marks and a masterful use of colour, Schneider’s mature works record the artist’s fleeting, exalted movements in space. Using wide brushes, Schneider applied paint across the canvas in rapid, dynamic motions that, once imprinted on the surface, came together to form an “orchestral whole”. The resulting paintings are musical in essence, each visual element producing a corresponding rhythm or melodic effect that envelops the viewer. Influenced by Kandinsky’s seminal theories of abstraction earlier in the century, Schneider often employed musical analogies to describe his creative process. “The spectator is free to interpret according to his feelings”, he once remarked of his paintings, “in the same way he might react to a sonata.” In 1945 he began titling most of his works “Opus”, reinforcing their inherent lyrical quality.Born in Sainte-Croix in Switzerland, Schneider enrolled at the École Nationale des beaux-arts de Paris in 1918 before settling permanently in the French capital in 1922. In the following years, he devoted himself to the study of art history while writing poetry and frequenting the city’s avant-garde circles. In the 1930s Schneider came into contact with Surrealism, and was drawn to that group’s fascination with the unconscious and practice of automatic drawing. While participating in several group exhibitions in Paris, including the Salon des Surindépendants and the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles, he gradually moved away from representation in favour of abstract forms and intuitive, imaginary compositions. By the early 1940s, his paintings had abandoned any trace of figurative representation.As his work gained prominence in post-war Paris, Schneider established himself as a major figure within the growing Lyrical Abstraction movement, with solo exhibitions in New York and across Europe throughout the early 1950s. The paintings of this period are characterised by a rich, dark colour palette and expressionistic brushwork that imparts a physical and emotional intensity.By the 1960s, Schneider’s marks became sharper and more calligraphic in nature, with brightly coloured backgrounds counterpointed by linear, black strokes that suggest the weight and orientation of the brush itself. The 1970s, which critic Michel Ragon described as the “luminous years” of the artist’s career, saw the artist increasingly adopting acrylic paint and working directly on paper, enabling a fluid, uninterrupted mark as well as a faster working method. These late works are a culmination of Schneider’s ultimate commitment to painting, alternating between dramatic tension and harmonious balance with a remarkable economy of means. Since the early 1950s, Gérard Schneider has been the subject of many retrospectives in Europe and abroad. He participated in the first two editions of Documenta in Kassel (1955, 1959), and exhibited three times at the Venice Biennale (1948, 1954 and 1966). For the 1966 edition, an entire room of the French Pavilion was devoted to his work. In 1957, Schneider won the Lissone Grand Prize for Abstract Art. His works also travelled regularly to Japan from 1950 until the early 1970s, especially for the International Exposition of Art.In addition, for the International Art Exhibition in Tokyo in 1959, he was awarded the prize of the Governor of Tokyo. Schneider also showed several times at the São Paulo Biennale (1951, 1953 and 1961). His works are held in the permanent collections of institutions worldwide, including the Musee d’Art Moderne, Brussels; the Walker Center of Minneapolis, Minnesota; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Phillips Collection, Washington D.C.; the Musée national d’Art Moderne – Centre Pompidou, Paris; and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Quebec, among many others.",Gérard Schneider,"22 Grafton Street, W1S 4EX","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 3 May  - 20 Jul 2024

The subjects of her work have often been partial views of internal spaces, some remembered and others imagined. In her new paintings thresholds, edges and apertures are sometimes visible, but more often than not are pushed to the sides, leading to increasing abstraction.Central for Parsons is that the paintings convey a much larger sense of scale and space than their small size might initially suggest. In some works, space is shaped and defined by lines and structures that recall architectural elements, while in others Parsons uses paint to veil or shadow interiors that can be glimpsed beneath. More recent paintings encourage space to expand and grow and creep towards the borders of the panel. As the limits of space are stretched, pulsating colour or soft yet luminous horizons reminiscent of the landscape are revealed, and the texture of paint and the mark of the brush become core elements of the visual field. In one of the most recent paintings in the exhibition, a white light pushes towards the foreground and almost dissolves its marked boundary.In a recent text on Parsons’ work, writer and poet Rachel Spence has described the paintings as visual poems: “Delicate, diminutive, measured, rhythmically playful but strict on internal structure. Withholding clarity to open the way towards a more enduring light. Our gaze narrows to look at them just as our ear quickens to catch poetry’s music. We peer. Lean closer. Pause. Painting as comma of time as well as occupier of space.”Vicken Parsons: Time coincides with the publication of the artist’s first retrospective monograph, a 296-page publication featuring works from throughout her career including drawings, paintings and sculpture.

She liberates the medium from its traditional places, creating interconnected bodies of work replete with both poetic and narrative possibilities. To create these, Singh draws on her extensive and ongoing pictorial archive that is constantly in motion and continuously refined. This show explores in part the intersection of photography and architecture, it includes a major series of wall-based pieces as well as a structural installation.The exhibition opens with a pair of large photographs of flowers. These evocative monochrome works have a decidedly sensuous presence. The delicate, semi-translucent petals of one seem to create an effect akin to a photographic negative, whilst the other appears to be in a somewhat disheveled state, likened by Singh to someone who has just tumbled out of bed.Occupying the other walls are a new series of ‘contact sheets’ which demonstrate the artist’s singular relationship with architecture. Constructed from rows of framed photographs, each work allows for the arrangement and rearrangement of individual images. This near-limitless possibility for new compositions and constructed histories reveals Singh’s ability to observe and capture what lies beyond the simple geometrical formation of a space. Years of practice have honed her ability to identify an archetypal essence of space, independent of scale, time or style. The images themselves are diverse, ranging from the ancient rock cut caves of 7th century Ellora in Maharashtra State or Le Corbusier’s Ronchamp Chapel to the contemporary Indian architecture of Rahul Mehrotra and the artist’s own architectural structures installed in museum spaces. They communicate Singh’s very subjective view of the history of architecture along with an intuitive feeling for light and how it falls upon surfaces and affects interior spaces. Here light itself is the common space in which all the images exist, allowing them to enter the realm of abstraction. Horizontal and vertical lines become tools through which to merge the real and potential, no longer defining where one ends and another begins.The gallery floor space is occupied by a large teak structure which references Singh’s freestanding museums that act as both means of display as well as storage for her photographs. But this particular work, which contains no images, is not quite sculpture nor architecture despite alluding to both. The installation has a distinctly domestic aspect, it contains a bed, a desk and seating, as such it proposes another way to live, a highly aesthetic and perhaps ascetic dwelling place.Dayanita Singh was born in New Delhi, India in 1961 where she lives and works. She studied Visual Communication at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad and Photojournalism and Documentary Photography at the International Center of Photography in New York.

Gagosian Grosvenor Hill,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/the-body-as-matter-giacometti-nauman-picasso/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Alberto Giacometti,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/giacometti/,"Radical investigations of the human body and how we perceive it characterize the distinct sculptural practices of Giacometti, Nauman, and Picasso, who are widely regarded as defining figures of their respective generations. From the modernist preoccupation with the fragmented or disintegrated body typical of Picasso’s and Giacometti’s work to the postmodern expansion of sculpture into a range of environmental and anti-monumental forms exemplified by Nauman’s, this is the first exhibition to juxtapose sculptures by these three artists. It features classic pieces by all three, including Picasso’s La femme enceinte I (1950) and Bras vertical (1961), Giacometti’s La jambe (1958) and Grande tête (1960), and Nauman’s Henry Moore Bound to Fail (1967–70) and Model for Room with My Soul Left Out, Room That Does Not Care (1984).A pioneer of Cubism best known for his paintings, drawings, and collages, Picasso produced numerous sculptures, which are among his most experimental works. He primarily sculpted in two distinct modes: modeling clay or plaster for casting into bronze, and constructing or assembling forms from discarded objects and cheap materials such as sheet metal, wood, and cardboard. In works of astonishing wit and originality, not to mention erotic suggestiveness, Picasso investigated means of manipulating mass and surface to incorporate multiple perspectives into a single head, limb, or figure.In Paris in the 1920s Giacometti came under the influence of Surrealism, encouraging him to incorporate into his sculptures a sense of sexual violence or threat that Nauman would later take up. Giacometti’s modeled and cast sculptures from the postwar period—fragile, highly textured, and strikingly elongated—broke away from the conventions of classical sculpture to evoke instead the survivors of some human or natural catastrophe. These depictions of the fractured and vulnerable figure or of isolated body parts appear frozen in motion, prompting reflections on mortality. Focusing almost exclusively on the body, Giacometti’s paring of the figure to its bare essentials challenged tradition and paved the way for contemporary artists to consider new possibilities.Since the 1960s Nauman has pursued a varied practice that builds on Picasso’s and Giacometti’s innovations. Nauman produces work in sculpture, performance, video, and neon that confronts viewers with their own physical limitations and employs repetitive actions, linguistic play, and stark imagery to disrupt perception and thought. The artist’s invocation of corporeal presence echoes Giacometti’s, yet he visualizes the human condition through the prisms of contemporary culture and modern technology. Addressing concerns such as the effect of surveillance and the allure of instant gratification, Nauman’s works require the viewer’s physical presence and mental engagement to activate them.Giacometti, Nauman, and Picasso have all redefined sculpture—reshaping traditional mediums and pioneering new ones. Picasso’s groundbreaking move away from a naturalistic representation of the human form was extended by Giacometti, whose elongated, modeled, and cast figures draw attention to material and process, while evoking the artist’s struggle to capture a living, breathing presence in three dimensions. Nauman often uses his own body as subject, and encourages the viewer to become an involved participant. For all three artists, the space we occupy, the ways we are perceived, and our effect on others are crucial elements in their unique methods of existential inquiry.Header: Left: Alberto Giacometti working in his studio, Paris, 1956.

Gazelli Art House,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/montage/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Helen Frankenthaler,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/helen-frankenthaler/,"Montage delivers a shrewd exploration of prominent Abstract Expressionist artists via a curatorial focus on assemblage, collage, and non-canvas artworks. Spotlighting Post-War artists long overlooked until recent decades, Gazelli Art House invites audiences to experience an amalgamation of diverse artistic voices that defined an era. Amidst a notable surge of interest in twentieth-century female abstract artists, ignited by Mary Gabriel’s pivotal book Ninth Street Women, the Montage show at Gazelli Art House offers a fresh perspective, delving into the diverse practices of women in abstraction, while also recognising Europe’s profound impact on the American Abstract Expressionist movement.Helen Frankenthaler’s works are a fusion of spontaneity and control, evidenced in her famed “soak-stain” technique, where she poured diluted paint onto unprimed canvas, allowing colours to blend organically. In 1973, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s exhibition Sixty-two Painted Book Covers, showcased Frankenthaler, a book about Helen Frankenthaler’s paintings, featuring a cover by Robert Motherwell and commentary by Barbara Rose. The special edition showcased uniquely painted cloth covers, transforming the book, as curator John J. McKendry highlights, “Frankenthaler, like a true artist-magician, has transformed this book. She has made a book on art into a work of art”.Nancy Grossman’s collages reveal a striking interplay of fragmented imagery and bold textures, offering a visceral exploration of the human psyche and societal constructs. Through her meticulous arrangement of materials, Grossman, as seen in Untitled (1963), pushes the boundaries of collage as a medium, infusing her work with a raw intensity that captivates viewers and invites contemplation of themes such as power, identity, and vulnerability.Grace Hartigan, renowned for her fearless exploration of form and colour, anchors the exhibition with her dynamic collages, offering viewers a glimpse into the visceral energy that characterised the Abstract Expressionist movement. The disparate elements in Hartigan’s work mirrors the emotional intensity and spontaneity inherent in this influential movement. During her time residing and working in New York, Hartigan cultivated a enduring fascination with jazz. Her artistic expression seen in Jazz in New York (1957) echoes the syncopated beats and free-flowing nature reminiscent of 1950s modern jazz.Through carefully arranged fragments of varying shapes and textures, Lilly Fenichel’s dynamic compositions and gestural brushwork emanate an irrepressibly vigorous energy, as seen in Collage IV (1961). Calligraphic forms are a common theme throughout Fenichel’s artwork, as was the influence of nature and Colour Field painting on her practice.Celebrated for her nuanced approach to abstraction, Perle Fine’s collages are a testament to her mastery of form and balance. Fine’s meticulous compositions reveal a profound engagement with texture and colour, offering a contemplative counterpoint to the more spontaneous expressions present in the collection. During the mid- 1960s, Fine produced a collection of painted wood reliefs, such as Supersonic Calm (c.1966), where individual components appeared fragmented, yet seamlessly integrated into a unified whole.Betty Parsons’ intuitive use of materials and keen sense of composition are showcased via a selection of collages and wooden assemblages that underscore her role as a catalyst for innovation. Parsons utilised vibrant hues to evoke emotional response, and while her style evolved over the years, her commitment to abstraction remained constant. In 1965, Parsons revisited sculpture, an art form that had been among her earliest mediums. She delved into experimentation with found materials such as driftwood, signage, and disassembled furniture gathered from the beach near her home. Transforming these elements into shapes reminiscent of buildings, toys, or masks, Parsons treated these assemblages with paint in a manner akin to her approach on canvas. This process, evident in works like Sound Melody (1977) and Untitled (Pink, Orange and Gray) (c.1970), breathed new life into these neglected objects, infusing them with the aura of mementos. These sculptures bear a profound connection to Parsons’ enduring fascination with the mysticism inherent in Native American craft and artistic production.Yvonne Thomas’ intricate layering and sensitivity to the emotive potentialities of colour offer soft landscapes of buoyant, abstract forms akin to the style seen in Collage (1958). Thomas was fascinated by the symbolism inherent in colours and the formation of her works hold an almost lyrical quality.Sonja Sekula, a luminary whose work often defies categorisation, contributes collages that transcend traditional artistic boundaries. Sekula’s inventive use of materials and layered compositions challenges preconceived notions of space and dimension, Untitled Collage (1959) exemplifies the avant-garde spirit of Abstract Expressionism while reflecting her surrealist influences. Her art gained recognition with her inclusion in prominent exhibitions such as Peggy Guggenheim’s Art of this Century and the Betty Parsons Gallery, as well as the landmark 1951 9th Street Show.Michael Corinne West’s works, ranging from heavily impastoed Cubist pieces to explosive collage compositions, reflect her intuitive and ever-evolving artistic approach. Through bold experimentation and a fusion of emotional intensity, West’s oeuvre enriches the legacy of New York’s Abstract Expressionist movement, while her exploration of automatism and Surrealist influences, alongside her anxieties about Cold War politics, imbue her work with a profound depth and complexity. One such example is Untitled (1979), a striking piece rendered in charcoal and collage on paper.",Montage,"39 Dover Street, W1S 4NN","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-7pm", 17 May  - 13 Jul 2024

His colourful works of vibrant geometric patterns are inspired by a wide range of influences, from Ewe and Asante cloth to jazz, the tradition of mural painting and the design of street kiosks along the roads of West-African towns. Kwami is known for expanding the notions of painting, basing his practice both in the visual world of his native Ghana and in reflections on modernism.The exhibition showcases work from 1999 to 2021, alongside an abstracted Kiosk structure Money Can’t Buy It (2019) constructed of found wood and conceived of as expanded three-dimensional paintings. The architectural scale work reference to the improvised vernacular of Ghanaian street painting. The show expounds on the range of influences on Kwami’s practice including his extensive travel across the African continent.Included in the show is the untitled painting that forms the foundation of his mural Dzidzɔ kple amenuveve (Joy and Grace) currently on view at Serpentine in London until September.Atta Kwami (b. 1956, Accra, Ghana, d. 2021, UK) studied, and later taught at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). In 2007, Kwami received a PhD in art history, now published as Kumasi Realism, 1951-2007: An African Modernism, in which he sought to explore past and present influences on West African art, with an emphasis on street art traditions throughout Kumasi, Ghana. He wrote about how his work was ‘described conventionally as “abstract”’ – but, he explained, ‘given that there is a very precise, knowable set of resources at the back of it, I would describe it rather as schematic: not like a map, but like a reaction to or interpretation of a map [...] the outcome of a series of engagements between practices, forms and visual environments that are specific to me in Ghana.’In 2021, the year he died, he was awarded the prestigious Maria Lassnig prize, which recognised later career artists deserving wider career recognition, and, in 2022, The Serpentine unveiled the final public mural commission by Kwami, DzidzƆ kple amenuveve (Joy and Grace), which remains on view until September 2024.This Spring, the Serpentine will publish a monograph edited by Melissa Blanchflower titled Atta Kwami, with Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther und Franz König, Köln supported by The Maria Lassnig Foundation and marking the first publication dedicated to examining the breadth of Kwami’s singular practice.Kwami’s work has been exhibited widely, notably creating large- scale public art commissions such as at the Folkestone Triennial in 2021 for which the artist made short-term alien interventions in the landscape. Solo exhibitions include: National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC (1994-1995), SOAS, University College of London (1996), Geometric Organic, National Museum Accra (1998-1999) and Kunsthalle Basel, Basel (2001).Kwami’s work is included in major collections around the world, including the National Museums of Ghana and Kenya; the V&A Museum, London; British Museum, London; the National Museum of African Art, Washington, DC; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, New York.",Atta Kwami,"26 Cork Street, W1S 3ND","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-4pm", 16 May  - 29 Jun 2024

Across the works on view in the exhibition is a desire for recollection, of exploring the past in order to make sense of the present. For Inniss, painting can be a vehicle for accessing a subconscious, emotional state and a means of scrutinising memories, both voluntary and involuntary.The genesis of painting for Inniss begins outside the studio itself, with a semi-diaristic practice in which the artist attempts to record in detail instances when she experiences olfactory memory, the strong association of a time and place with a specific scent. By attempting to recall the sights, sounds and thoughts that accompany smell, the artist observes the fallibility and hierarchies of visual memory; spaces come into focus whilst, simultaneously, abstract absences are revealed.Compositions start to be derived through drawings from these self-observations, clarifying the emotionally resonant and collapsing the past onto the present. Often architectural in their nature, the works appear as interiors devoid of figures, with details of rooms or passages highlighted. Often interspersed with a subtle floral motif or overlaid with the branches of trees, there is a feeling of nature reclaiming urban space or of competing timelines compressed. For Inniss, painting becomes a tool to explore her own cerebral archive, utilising memory as an act of “willed creation”, an idea inspired by Toni Morrison’s essays in The Source of Self-Regard. Painting from memory is therefore not simply a way to assess how something truly was but a means of scrutinising how and why things appear the way they do once committed to memory.Often sketching from an image in her mind’s eye, the artist visualises her own patterns of thought and questions why certain events or elements appear more clearly than others. Working light to dark, Inniss begins with the brightest white tones at the surface, before applying a mid-tone across the canvas then following with darker passages, producing a kind of inverted image, like a developing photographic negative. The process and the result itself recall flashbulb memory, the near-photographic recollection of emotional experience. Translated into paint, the images, like our own subconscious recall, can be mysterious and lacking in detail, bringing about certain biases. The images reveal both fact and absence, exposing hierarchies of individual thought and memory, with specific colours, figures and sceneries coming into focus, while others remain unearthed or misremembered.Choices about the painting’s scale and the shape of canvas indicate the feel of a certain memory, some smaller, more tentative, others dominant, enveloping and immersive. This is true also of the mark-making, with some more sparse or hesitant, flickering into focus, while others are bold and graphic and delineate a clear geometry to define a room or landscape. The handling and layering of paint also speak to the form of memory, with areas of translucence recalling overlapping or transient experience, deployed as washes over the canvas in thinned-out oils.Gaps in understanding, however, might also produce a need to be filled in. The paint is often lent an additional physicality through layering gesso or adding sand to the paint to create texture as a kind of stubbornness, something to offset the alarm caused by the imminent possibility of forgetting. Memories, often imbued with a kind of dreamlike logic or lack of logic, also find visual analogy in paint, with long shadows cast from objects with no discernible source of light and stark uses of light and shadow giving an overall sense of the otherworldly.Throughout all the paintings in this exhibition, Inniss points to different facets of memory as a performative act and not a static reality. In particular, the artist draws on her own personal experience as a woman of dual heritage in order to question how spaces are constructed and how she remembers them, exploring both the clarity of - but also gaps within - memory to reflect her own nuanced lens of understanding the world.",Hettie Inniss: Rememories from the Floating World,"2 Bourdon Street, W1K 3PA","Wed-Sat 11am-6pm, Tue by appointment", 30 May  - 20 Jul 2024

I feel that we have endured difficult and hard times in the past, facing challenges of the present and looking forward to a bright future.“In this expansive work, Panchal captures a collective portrait reflecting our enduring resilience and interconnectedness. Depicting various Londoners engaged in different roles - an artist, an NHS worker, a waiter, among others - the painting also incorporates elements of the cityscape, including landmarks like the Black Cultural Archives, Brixton Windmill, and Tate Modern. Notably, it features memorials such as The African and Caribbean War Memorial and the Cherry Groce Memorial Pavilion in Windrush Square, symbolizing both cherished places and individuals, as well as the losses and struggles faced. These elements come together to celebrate, commemorate, and inspire as we navigate through shared experiences and strive to rebuild.Panchal has also done two other public commissions in London - Across the Barrier, which was a part of the Anti-Racism Mural, GLC, Lowood Street, Shadwell, Tower Hamlets (1985) and the Roxborough Bridge Mural, Harrow (1994).During his early years in London, as well as while traveling across Europe and America, Shanti noticed a historical neglect of watercolour's potential compared to oil and acrylic. Instead of exploring its depths, watercolour seemed confined to conventional subjects like flowers and landscapes, which proved frustrating for him. Unwilling to conform to these limitations, he embarked on an obsessive journey of artistic exploration.His dedication led him to experiment with various sizes, from large canvases to small paper sheets. Seeking depth, he abandoned traditional colour mixing on palettes and opted to apply colours directly onto the paper, encouraging them to penetrate its fibres. Through relentless hammering and scraping, his process evolved, blending success and failure into each stroke. Layers upon layers of colour became a metaphor for life experiences, simultaneously ecstatic and despairing.The earthy tones dominating his palette reflected his upbringing in a Gujarati village, inspiring a deeply personal visual language. His paintings depicted family life, where privacy was a foreign concept, yet each character carved out inner sanctuaries amidst their shared space, revealing poignant loneliness.Despite the prevalent belief that ""painting is dead"", a notion persisting since the invention of photography in 1839, Shanti adamantly believed in its enduring relevance. For him, painting is not just alive but also uniquely meaningful, fuelling his dedication to push boundaries. He foresaw that the debate surrounding painting's relevance would persist into the 21st century and beyond, emphasizing its unparalleled ability to capture human nature and the cosmic forces shaping our existence.While many contemporary artists pursued a detached, machine-like quality in their work, Shanti sought to infuse his creations with spiritual depth and passion. His influences range from the mystical visions of El Greco and William Blake to his own Hindu sensibility, grounding his vision in a rich tapestry of spirituality and tradition.The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue which includes a detail biography of the artist and an essay by writer, critic, and curator Andrew Lambirth.",Shanti Panchal: Endurance,"35 Bury Street, St. James's, SW1Y 6AY",Mon-Fri 10am-5pm, 10 May  - 2 Jun 2024  
Hamiltons,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/nick-waplington-living-room/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Nick Waplington,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/nick-waplington/,"Nick Waplington’s first book, Living Room, was published in 1991, and was an instant sensation within the photography world and beyond. The 59 photographs in the original edition documented the lives of friends, families, and neighbours on the Broxtowe housing estate in Nottingham, England, where Waplington spent many years making thousands of images. This extensive archive of unseen photographs forms the basis of this new conceptual remake of the 1991 monograph, one that revisits and refashions Waplington’s iconic work from a contemporary vantage point. This new work follows the same sequencing of landscape and portrait images as the original edition - replacing each of the 59 photographs with an as-yet-unseen work from the Living Room archive, often from the same roll of film as the original image. The result is both familiar and uncanny, a vivid journey back to Thatcher’s Britain and a testament to the decades of art and life that have elapsed between then and now.Whilst Waplington’s early work was intrinsically rooted in ‘documentary’ practice, it also challenged the conventional documentary gaze. Simon Baker, director of Maison Européenne de la Photographie, importantly notes that Waplington employs a deeply humanistic approach which is resistant to voyeuristic or intrusive documentation. Indeed, Simon states: “Waplington is broadly curious and deeply committed in his work, and as serious about family life as politics or art, or music and the social cultures around it, but always as both witness and participant”, a method which achieves his simultaneous intimacy and invisibility.“When I thought something was going to happen, I’d pick up the camera and take some pictures very quickly and then put the camera down. And then not take any again for a while. You don’t want to be taking pictures all the time in a documentary-esque situation, because otherwise it becomes about you and the camera and not the situation. It’s about having an instinct for when something is going to happen.” – Nick Waplington.Waplington’s choice of a 6x9 camera, commended by John Berger in an essay in both the 1991 and 2024 publications of ‘Living Room’, produces a landscape crop where “the forms photographed have the space to expand, to become landscapes, or even firmaments“. The artist’s purposeful use of colour emanates American street landscape characteristics, mixed with a quintessentially British documentary style. Waplington reacts to what he describes as the common “grainy, downtrodden, black and white interpretation of working-class life”; instead, Waplington’s lens does not estrange the subjects from the viewers but turns the domestic into public in a way where tears, screams, jokes, solace, tiredness and pleasure have equal room.UK and US-based artist Nick Waplington works with photography as a medium to submerge in communities, resulting in personal involvement and visual work. He caught the attention of John Berger and Richard Avedon, along with the rest of the world, in the 1990s with Living Room and has since then created recognisable, frank representations of people and their socio-political backgrounds. Beginning in his teenage years, his subjects have ranged from post Punk youth culture against the backdrop of Thatcherism, to the heyday of House and rave culture in 1990s NYC. In 2008/9 Waplington documented the production of the last collection of Alexander McQueen at his London studio. He continues to work in London and New York on a series of overlapping photographic and art projects.Waplington has had solo shows as an independent artist across the UK and the USA, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art (The ‘Living Room’ and ‘Circles of Civilization’ Series, 1992), The Photographers’ Gallery London (‘Living Room’ 1990-1991) and more recently Tate Britain (‘Working Process’ 2015). His works have also featured in group shows at the Venice Biennale (‘Learn How To Die the Easy Way’, 2001), Brooklyn Museum in New York City (‘This Place’, 2016) and White Chapel Gallery (June-September 2017).His works are part of the permanent collections of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, Victoria and Albert Museum and Government Art Collection in London and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Alongside being honoured with the Infinity Award: Young Photographer in 1993 by the International Center of Photography in New York City.

The first presentation of this work not only marked Genzken’s inaugural show with the gallery but also captured a specific moment in time. Working in Berlin and in New York at the turn of the century, the artist witnessed the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent changing landscape of the city, as well as the collapse of the World Trade Center in New York City. In parallel, from the late 1990s on, the artist’s sculptural works moved towards assembled installations that borrowed their aesthetic from collages, combining objects with variations in scale. The work on view exemplifies this new artistic language, characterised by its engagement with architectural form and its social dimension. Through the combination of materials sourced for purpose, this multifaceted installation contains layered references and takes on new meaning in today’s landscape.About the exhibitionThe installation’s starting point came from the artist’s fascination with the ‘Wasserspeier’ (gargoyles) on Cologne Cathedral, encountering their restoration in the building’s masonry shop. Having tried to convince the cathedral’s master builder to let her take the carvings to London, the artist instead created her own gargoyles for the exhibition in 2004, setting them in dialogue with winged, angelic figures. The duality between the earthbound and the heavenly has permeated Genzken’s career, reflected in her formal vocabulary through materials associated with engineering and heaviness, such as electric cables, aluminum panels and trollies, in addition to objects evoking the sky, light and wind, from blue sheets to bright lamps and umbrellas.Historically, carved gargoyles were provisions for preservation, designed to direct rainwater away from the building, as well as for protection, banishing demons by holding up a mirror to evil. Bringing them from the roof to eye level, Genzken’s gargoyles, instead, confront viewers and humanity at large. In the same way that some gargoyles depict a hybrid of animals with human features, the artist imparts an anthropomorphic quality to her figures by giving them heads and body-like frames. Two figures even wear Genzken’s own clothing, a jacket and cap, lending the work an autobiographical undertone whilst also offering a reminder of civilisation.The four ‘Wasserspeier’ on trolleys appear to skate on the aluminium floor, which brings to mind the Chrysler Building’s metal cladding. The shiny material also enables the work to interact with the world around it, both literally through reflections and metaphorically by speaking to geopolitics; as such, the work and the surroundings become one. ‘In an effort not to represent the world but to be part of it— in other words, to be modern—Genzken chose as her raw materials the cheap, shiny, and ubiquitous building blocks of the contemporary urban environment [...]. Working with these real-world materials, she created installations that engaged with the everyday in substance as well as in subject,’ remarks Laura Hoptman, co-curator of ‘Isa Genzken: Retrospective’ (2013 – 2014) at MoMA, New York.Totemic columns and pedestals recur throughout Genzken’s work and are seen here cloaked in blue plastic that alludes to the wings of angels and is reminiscent of the way in which gowns are draped in Leonardo da Vinci’s drawings. Other objects, such as the sacrificial lamb or twigs and broken umbrellas, evoking the power of wind and nature, allow the viewer to relate to the work’s inherently human qualities of fragility and vulnerability, setting Genzken apart from her minimalist predecessors who pursued notions of order and power in their work. The artist’s interplay of objects conjures a place that is free and ethereal whilst making viewers aware of the restrictions and limitations of the real world.",Isa Genzken.

As such, ‘every medium gets expanded and de-specified: a film can turn into a painting, a painting can become a film,’ as remarked by Isabelle Graw, German art historian, educator and publisher of the journal Texte zur Kunst, in a conversation with the artist. Wanting to go beyond normal photography-based film, the infrared images capture a world consisting of colors and energy. Translated onto canvas with oils, the resulting paintings capture both a stylized world and an essence, a feeling, as in ‘STILTS ZOON X2’ (2023). As relayed to Graw, Korine said, ‘I wanted to make paintings that feel like they’re basically alive. I wondered if one can make works and imagery that look like nothing has preceded them? This project is almost closer to a futurist take on visuals, painting and film.’Some paintings, such as ‘Drift XI’ (2023), focus on close-ups of heads, reflecting the importance of details for the artist. In close to mid-range framing, the infrared camera is able to sensitively detect variations in thermal energy, heat, which is then transformed into a more detailed image. Harnessing the aesthetic potential of infrared, Korine explains ‘the closer you get, the more heat is pulled from the image and the more alive it looks.’ The resulting paintings evoke a visceral reaction in which viewers can visualize and almost feel heat from the body, an immersive experience that Korine describes as ‘close to the idea of being inside of a video game’. The technological workings of the camera mean that, within wide shots, lines are softened and the figures’ features are de-emphasized. The further away from objects, the more impressionistic the image, producing an unearthly quality. Korine comments that ‘The colors and the grain structure start to explode the whole idea of lines. They become more about depicting the vibration of the energy.’The artist spent time mixing paints to intensify the strength and luminosity of the pigments, seeing how far he could push paint, the film and the idea of energy. With influences ranging from Martin Kippenberger’s playful paintings to William Eggleston’s vibrant photographs, Korine’s eccentric color palette of blues, greens, pinks and oranges—dictated by the infrared imagery—not only heightens the sense of liveliness but also the element of science fiction. ‘REVELATOR MAXIMUS’ (2023) shows a walking figure, its surroundings marked by overwhelming monochromatic hues. Variations in shade are important here, from teal to cobalt, forming an unnatural yet ethereal environment. For the artist, ‘the colors are so full of life [...] At the same time the subject matter and the characters are so grim and dystopian so there’s this interesting discourse between the two.’ Compelled to tell a story with his films, Korine’s paintings offer a more immediate encounter with his fantastical world, their subject matter borne from color and energy.",Harmony Korine.

Inspired by the ability of objects to elicit or illustrate associations, emotions and dynamics, Irini also explores the idea of the object as continuation of the self and its role in the structures we put in place to support it. Reinterpreting - almost theatrically - familiar forms, she looks at how the things we surround ourselves with might double as coping tools, introducing multi-sensory comfort tactics and rituals through experiments with materiality, relief sculpture and the language of diagrams and schematic representation.The Consolation of Imaginary Things is Irini’s first solo exhibition with the gallery and is accompanied by The Drawing Board, a short story written by Georgia Stephenson. ",Irini Bachlitzanaki: The Consolation of Imaginary Things,"1st Floor, 6 Conduit Street, W1S 2XE","Wed-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 12-4pm", 31 May  - 13 Jul 2024

In their work, human forms assume the silhouettes of mountains, seashells spiral into celestial constellations. Weaving fragments of bodies into landscapes, the works in this show honour the kinship between humans, nature, and the cosmos.The exhibition takes its title from a quote by Luchita Hurtado (1920-2020), the sensational Venezuelan-American artist who dedicated her career to bridging the gap between the self and all other living forms. Her extraordinary artwork presents life from unique perspectives. She turns the viewer’s gaze upwards with her skyscape paintings. She expands the viewer’s soul with depictions of limbs extending into sacred landscapes or standing figures becoming trees in forests. Always in tune with the ever-changing world around her, Hurtado’s work illuminates the shimmering threads that connect different forms of life on Earth and beyond. Her painting ‘Untitled’ (c. 1976), is a great example of her skyscape series and the centrepiece of this exhibition.Inspired by the late painter, the artists in this show share Hurtado’s belief in the universality of all life forms. Their practices inspire us to explore the natural world with wonder and collectively bear witness to its magical beauty. They interrogate assumed relationships between forms, revealing the harmonious connections between humans and nature. In their work, there is a visceral feeling that connects the viewer to the rhythms of nature.Fragmenting natural elements into their own visual language of abstract geometries or surreal dreamscapes, the artists in this show celebrate the inherent energy that binds us together. It is no coincidence that women share the same cycle as the moon–we are all part of a universal process of metamorphosis.

Dash,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/n-dash/,"N. Dash’s paintings draw on the building blocks of our natural and constructed worlds, includingearth and water, jute and cotton, graphite and oil, along with oft-overlooked fabricated items such as architectural insulation and factory-produced cardboard. Across the works in the exhibition, these elements are recombined to elevate the structural, textural, and energetic synergies and tensions among them. A work whose hue resembles patinated copper might comprise Styrofoam insulation, or an image might be silkscreened onto a panel on which earth has been troweled and dried into a cracked, furrowed plane. There are slippages among the many materials, processes, and signifiers that are evoked in these paintings—each held together by careful, spare decisions.At the core of N. Dash’s work is a daily ritual wherein the artist rubs a small piece of white cotton between finger and thumb until the machine-loomed fibers fray and lose their gridded structure, decomposing into an abject tangle. For the artist, the fabric serves as a recording device on which actions are imprinted, energy is captured, and immaterial forces are stored. The resulting sculptures are colored by a patina of dirt and oils, transformed by the spontaneous movement of the artist’s body. The grid, one of modernism’s paradigmatic forms, is undone again and again in the artist’s hand—by the body, the weather, and the environment. The artist photographs iterations of these sculptures and silkscreens the images onto panels prepared with earth, such that the images undulate according to the earth’s topography. In addition, planes of color are silkscreened, leaving fields of rosette patterns that result from the halftone printing process.The works’ beveled edges reveal their earthen substrates, allowing them to breathe. In these carved-out margins, the layers of earth, gesso, and jute are rendered visible, exposing the quasi-geologic structure of each panel. This strategy appears differently in a series of works in which strings are embedded in, or excavated from, the earthen grounds, the latter creating fine trenches of negative space, where the materiality of the work is exposed and raw. Ecological concerns course through these paintings with references to human and nonhuman interconnection and intervention. They examine, on an intimate scale, the impact of touch on natural resources, and reckon with the ways in which synthetic materials contain, shape, and merge with the environment. Here, Photoshop can imitate a field of flowers with an algorithmic printing pattern, but a rosette is still a field of ones and zeros. These questions of mimesis, artificiality, and exploitation are at play in these paintings, but subtly so. Through the works on view, nature and byproducts of manufacture are counterposed on vertical stages of earth, uplifting this most fundamental material and source.",N.

Across her oeuvre, Andreani repurposes personal memorabilia and archival photographs, addressing forgotten histories through a subversive and feminist lens. Working primarily in her signature palette of Payne’s grey – a blue-grey hue rich with echos of the past – her works unearth buried narratives to reconstruct timeless and prescient stories for the present moment.Emerging from a compendium of collective memories, the exhibited works find their origins in the archives of Reggio Emilia. Faded letters, yellowed documents and, above all, black-and-white photographs comprise the foundation of the artist’s practice. Guided by an unorthodox approach to research, Andreani selects, gathers and filters archival material in a non-linear way, sifting, layering and interweaving freeze-framed moments in time. Driven by the sociopolitical history of Reggio Emilia, the resulting compositions raise poignant questions about the perceived societal roles of women throughout history, contending with underlying power dynamics while dismantling gender stereotypes.Lending the exhibition its title, Andreani’s painting L’improduttiva (The Unproductive One), 2023, presents a group of students entirely absorbed in their work as seamstresses. All but one, that is, who looks out towards the viewer defiantly, a mischievous smile flitting across her face. The work is based on an archival photograph from the early 1940s which documents the tailoring school of Reggio Emilia, founded at this time by Giulia Maramotti. While women’s acceptance into the workforce during World War II marked a breakthrough moment of emancipation, it simultaneously highlighted the vast gulf of opportunity and liberty between the sexes. Capturing the viewer's attention, the woman’s brazen smirk and gaze serve as a symbol of this inherent irony.A smiling woman has often been denigrated as mad or hysterical throughout history. Such themes of insanity, internal exile and imprisonment, tied so closely to women’s history, are integral to Andreani’s research. Drawing from the archival material of the former Psychiatric Hospital of San Lazzaro, dating from the late nineteenth century to the 1970s, the artist painted her seven canvas work, Le sette sante (The Seven Holy Ones), 2023. Based on small identity photographs of seven female internees, originally taken for documentation purposes, Andreani enlarges each image to the scale of a human face, as if restoring her subjects with dignity and compassion.Melding fact and fiction, Andreani’s works offer visual montages in which histories, temporalities and topographies collide. In the largest painting in the exhibition, La traghettatrice (The Ferryman), 2023, four seemingly disparate figures are represented along a picture-postcard seafront, as two warplanes dive ominously in the background. Based on photographs from different archives, each figure looks directly out at the viewer, drawing us in to their individual worlds.Giving voice to the voiceless of bygone eras, Andreani’s works frequently centre anonymous subjects, particularly female ones, elevating the traditionally sidelined to historical status. The motif of the mask is a recurring trope across her oeuvre. Prevalent in two of the exhibited works from 2023, L’anonima (The Anonymous One) and La gitana anarchica (Djali-Leda) (The Anarchist Gypsy (Djali-Leda)), it becomes representative of the performative roles enacted by women to survive in society. In masking her protagonists, Andreani in fact draws attention to them, endowing them with an unbreakable, formidable strength. Thus foregrounding the small but mighty ripples made by defiant women through history, Andreani weaves new life from the dust of forgotten archives.Giulia Andreani (*1985, Venice) lives and works in Paris. Andreani’s work has been the subject of solo exhibitions in international institutions including Collezione Maramotti, Reggio Emilia (2024); Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dole (2019–2020); Labanque, Béthune (2019); Villa Médicis, Rome (2018); Centre d’Art Nei Liicht de Dudelange, Luxembourg (2017); La Conserverie, Metz (2016); Lab Labanque Béthune, Richebourg (2014); Centre culturel l’Escale, Levallois (2013); and Premier Regard, Paris (2012), among others.Andreani’s work is in the public collections of Centre Pompidou, Paris; MASP, São Paulo; Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin; Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BnF), Paris; Collezione Maramotti, Reggio Emilia; Musée national de l’histoire de l’immigration, Paris; FRAC Poitou-Charentes, Angoulême; Centre Culturel Opderschmelz, Dudelange; Collection de la Ville de Montrouge; and URDLA, Villeurbanne.Giulia Andreani’s work is currently on view as part the 60th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia.",Giulia Andreani: L'improduttiva,"41 Dover Street, W1S 4NS","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 30 May  - 3 Aug 2024

Her interest in the figure of the goddess – particularly the Hindu goddess Kali, who both destroys and creates the world anew, and is often pictured with a garland of human heads – is evident in her depictions of women metamorphosing into nature. In Sikand’s paintings, women are seeds buried in soil, hang on tree branches to provide shelter, or are even the earth and sky themselves. These amorphous relationships between the figure and nature were further inspired by the Chipko environmental movement, which began in north India during the 1970s, when villagers – mostly women – embraced trees at risk of deforestation, a protest that also highlighted their primary role as caregivers. Sikand’s female figures are often portrayed as strong: appearing resolute with multiple heads or acting as protectors over her landscapes. They also remain ambiguous and elusive, echoing the shapeshifting symbolism of Hindu allegories that persisted in her imagination.Sikand’s paintings contain multiple layers of gouache, watercolour and ink, often laboriously made. Her deep fascination with palimpsests – ancient parchments scraped clean and used again, that bear the traces of time – led her to experiment with breaking the surface of her paintings, likely using sandpaper and wire wool as she did in later works, and then repairing the paper in a technique similar to papier mâché. Sikand’s works function as pentimenti, where the marks of earlier paintings lie visible underneath the surface. In her acts of erasure and revision, she folded history into her work, gesturing to the unreliability of memory and the tension in the encounter between images from different cultures.Born in 1960 in the Punjab region of India, Sikand relocated with her family in 1970 aged 10 and eventually settled in the Rhondda valley in South Wales. She attended City of Birmingham Polytechnic and upon graduating in 1983 moved to Nottingham, where she lived, worked, and was deeply active in the arts community for close to 40 years. After being selected by Gavin Jantjes as the East Midlands Arts Prize winner in 1984, she co-founded the Nottingham Indian Artists’ Group alongside Said Adrus and Sardul Gill. In 1987, she had her first solo exhibition in London at the pioneering feminist bookshop Sisterwrite. In 1988, she was included in Eddie Chambers’ foundational touring group exhibition Black Art: Plotting the Course, and her painting featured on the cover of that catalogue. Sikand’s work was included in other significant exhibitions in the 1980s and 1990s including The Circular Dance at Arnolfini, Bristol, alongside Sutapa Biswas and Chila Kumari Burman (1991); Myth, Dream, and Fable at Angel Row Gallery, Nottingham, alongside Paula Rego and Eileen Cooper (1992); and Transforming the Crown: African, Asian and Caribbean Artists in Britain 1966–1996 at the Caribbean Cultural Center, New York, alongside Lubaina Himid, Claudette Johnson, and Keith Piper, amongst many others (1997). She exhibited less after 2000, although her commitment to her practice remained absolute. Recent solo exhibitions of her work have taken place at New Art Exchange, Nottingham (2012); TG Gallery, Nottingham (2021); and Trace Gallery, Nottingham (2023). Since Sikand’s death in 2021, her work has been acquired by collections including the British Museum, London; Nottingham City Museums via the Contemporary Art Society; and the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Norwich.",Gurminder Sikand: Early Paintings,"47 Mortimer Street, W1W 8HJ","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 16 May  - 29 Jun 2024

This exhibition is being held at a time when Cordeiro’s significance is increasingly being recognised on the international stage. He is, for example, among the invited artists in this year’s Venice Biennale, opening shortly before The Mayor Gallery’s exhibition. Cordeiro’s works are also held in major museum and private collections internationally, including the Cisneros Collection (CPPC), Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, MoMA, New York, Reina Sofia, Madrid, Museum of Contemporary Art, São Paulo and the Victoria & Albert Museum, London.Born in 1925 in Rome to a Brazilian father and Italian mother, Cordeiro moved after World War II ended to São Paulo and assumed full Brazilian citizenship in 1948. His emergence as an influential artist in the early-mid 1950s in São Paulo coincided with a postwar moment when Brazil — described then by media theorist Vilém Flusser as a country ""in the making"" — first became known internationally for radical architectural and urban landscaping interventions, led by Oscar Niemeyer and Roberto Burle Marx. In 1952, Cordeiro — with six like- minded collaborators including Gerald de Barros — formed a group and movement they named 'Ruptura', signaling a substantive break with the figuration otherwise dominant in visual art until that period. Combining this with often polemical articles and reviews of the works of others, Cordeiro was regarded throughout the 1950s in Brazil as a critical figurehead of a technological aesthetics that began to be associated in particular with São Paulo based artists and writers.As this exhibition brings into exceptional focus through its display of remarkable concrete art works such as Círculos Simultâneos of 1952 and Transposição Cromática Estudo da Cor from 1958, Cordeiro is a master at combining a sensory-affective field of interplay between lines and circles, colours and planes with a sense of technological distancing. The 1950s material as well as a series of works from the early-mid 1960s (never before seen in Europe) included in this exhibition are revealed as critical steps towards the pioneering leap taken by Cordeiro from the late 1960s into the early 1970s with his use of electronic computation to create indelibly memorable and highly original works of art. Four of Cordeiro’s computer-based art prints — including the extraordinary The Woman Who Is Not B.B. (A mulher que não e B.B.), 1971, that radically differentiated Cordeiro’s work from others in the same period with its use of computers to convey a highly critical socio- political message —are among the important highlights of this exhibition.Indeed, over the course of Cordeiro’s artistic practice from its beginnings to its radically early closure, we find an inextricable entangling of aesthetic and social concerns. This is addressed in a specially commissioned catalogue essay for this exhibition from art and media historian, Bronac Ferran.The selection of works for this new exhibition at the recently opened new space of the Mayor Gallery in St James’s has been made in close collaboration with Waldemar Cordeiro’s daughter, Analivia Cordeiro, who is also an internationally renowned artist. She will be present at the exhibition opening and will participate in a talk event together with Bronac Ferran as part of the London Art Weekend on 30th May.",Waldemar Cordeiro: A Singular Constellation,"9 Bury Street, SW1Y 6AB",Mon-Fri 10am-5.30pm, 30 May  - 26 Jul 2024

He then developed his current artistic practice, while also working as an illustrator for several years. His architectural background is evident within his work, with Brazilian modernist architecture and his home of São Paulo influencing both form and colour within his oeuvre. His muted, monochromatic palette emerged from São Paulo’s concrete landscape, with the organised geometry of modernist architecture translated into the precise aesthetic of his compositions, much like his experience with black and white photography.In his debut exhibition at Mazzoleni, Espírito Santo presents four sculptures which utilise distinct materials: stone, glass and metal. Each sculpture presents an accurate representation of a real object’s shapes and proportions, while simultaneously playing with the scale and materiality. For three decades this has been a constant strategy for the artist, exploring ordinary objects that are usually neglected due to their banality. With the restriction of the materials, Espírito Santo converges the tangibility of matter and the conceptual nature of artificial objects, using geometrical definitions that are implicit in them. The material’s density and weight conflict with the image quality of the sculptures, as exemplified in Luz Negra (2022), where the hyperreal finishing, not found in a functional light bulb, is elevated from the ordinary to the realm of auratic icon.My process of making sculptures involves a return to the design project, that is, a re-idealization of certain objects, which are mostly anonymous. It’s an essentially different operation from using a found object, a readymade, or making a cast of an object. My sculpture is not indexical. Instead of reproducing an actual object, it alludes to its technical drawing, to the conception of its shape and dimensions. - Iran do Espírito Santo, 2021In a separate space, a selection of watercolours on paper are exhibited, which go further to explore the intricacies involved in Espírito Santo’s work. These works are also created from meticulous observations of real objects. Luz Negra IX (2021) moves to reawaken us from our habitual indifference towards the everyday, instead communicating the beauty that can be found in the mechanics of human existence. The artist’s watercolours, a traditionally fluid medium, are controlled and contained and just like the sculptures, are composed of basic geometrical forms that are gathered to create a recognisable sign. Espírito Santo explains that “In many of my works, abstraction and concreteness are brought together as two poles that parallel the human existential condition, which is compulsorily subject to concrete reality and abstract thinking.”",Iran do Espírito Santo,"15 Old Bond Street, W1S 4AX","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat by appointment", 30 May  - 6 Sep 2024

Even when painting a seemingly neutral subject, such as an abstract shape or an inanimate object, Simon is looking for the tension or “the hidden power beneath the surface.”In her recent works, Simon has shifted to painting figures and heads that are subjected to a variety of situations and scenarios. The heads, with their fixed expressions and hollow appearance, are also masks. As a mask, they conceal shame, block madness, and protect the wearer from anger and horror. While they can appear outwardly melancholic, aggressive, or apathetic, they are intended to convey deep emotion. For Simon, they act as a vehicle to give voice to inexpressible needs and suffering.Phantom, the painting for which the exhibition is named, most clearly illustrates Simon’s intention of making the unseen visible. The face of a spirit appears on the body of the painter and dominates her. Dots flow from the eyes, across the shoulders, and down the arms of the painter, as the painter then tries to capture the spirit on the canvas.Raphaela Simon studied at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf and the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.

Through his timeless still lifes, Morandi transforms mundane objects into symbols of deeper human experience, prompting reflection on the nature of existence itself. In contrast, Ralaivao’s paintings burst with energy and sensuality, capturing fleeting moments of intimacy and anticipation. His bold use of colour and dynamic compositions draw viewers into a world where every brushstroke pulses with life, inviting them to explore the boundaries between reality and imagination.Although the artists may seem like an unlikely pairing at first glance, their works share a profound reverence for the subtleties of everyday objects and a commitment to exploring the essence of perception itself. Both artists engage viewers by highlighting the compositional aspect of their artwork alongside material surfaces. While Morandi’s compositions resemble studio photography, evoking a sense of familial assembly akin to a wedding portrait, Ralaivao’s works reflect the influence of contemporary mobile phone photography, where the camera becomes an active participant in capturing moments and sparking immediate reflection and dialogue.Together, Morandi and Ralaivao weave a narrative that transcends the constraints of a single frame, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the timeless beauty of still life compositions. Born nearly a century apart, this exhibition reveals the shared differences between two artists, across generations, finding themselves in the same city, and united by a common bond: their unwavering dedication to the art of painting.“Both Ralaivao and Morandi are reductive artists, their language is quiet, the tone of their paintings cool, and it feels quite fitting that this exhibition should be a closely selected one. It offers a tantalising starter, and leaves me wanting more.” – Paul ColdwellAbout the Artists:Giorgio Morandi (1890-1964), born in Bologna, Italy, was an Italian painter renowned for his contemplative still lifes and landscapes.

René, with her eponymous gallery in Paris, played a pivotal role in promoting abstract and kinetic art during the mid-20th century, recognising the potential of both Vasarely and Agam early in their careers. In 1955, together with Vasarely, and art historian Pontus Hultén, René curated the influential group exhibition, Le Mouvement, which ignited a fresh perspective on kinetic art. This landmark event introduced a cohort of emerging younger artists such as Agam, Soto, Bury, and Tinguely, while juxtaposing their burgeoning artworks with those of established masters like Calder, Duchamp, and Vasarely himself. Ten years later, the artists participated together in MoMA’s 1965 blockbuster exhibition, The Responsive Eye, where they exhibited alongside Josef Albers, Agnes Martin, and Frank Stella. The exhibition introduced Kinetic and Optical art to America, consecrating the movement, and inaugurating new frontiers for the study of perspective.Born in Hungary in 1906, Victor Vasarely is widely recognised as the ‘grandfather’ of Op Art and leader of the movement. Originally training in medical science, Vasarely then turned his eye to visual art, approaching it with a will of method and objectivity not dissimilar to that of a scientist. After initial infatuations with Cubism, Futurism, and Symbolism, Vasarely developed his signature style in the late 1940s, a blend of geometrical forms, colours, and repetitive patterns that examined the way human brains absorb and process visual information. In Tridim Har, 1980, Vasarely challenges the viewer’s perception of reality through a juxtaposition of several cubes in a myriad of colours, crafting an optical illusion and fracturing the perspective plane. Fascinated by technology, physics, and sci-fi, Vasarely’s intuitions and theories helped define the psychedelic culture of the 1960s, leading to developments in neuroscience, quantum physics and experimental psychology. By this time, he had created and patented his Plastic Unit, the basis of his Plastic Alphabet.Yaacov Agam was born in Israel (at the time Mandate Palestine) in 1928 before moving permanently to Zürich in 1949 and then on to Paris in 1951. In Zürich, he studied at the Kunstgewerbe Schule, under the renowned colour theorist Johannes Itten and was greatly inspired by the creations of Swiss artist Max Bill. Similarly to Vasarely, Agam was also an inventor and was interested in exploring the relationship between art and the viewer. Whilst principally a multimedia artist, he is most celebrated for his creation of the Agamograph; an artwork that incorporates several images that are sliced into strips and interlaced together to illustrate different images depending on the angle from which it is viewed. Paris, 1990-1991 is indicative of this concept as the boldly coloured picture plane is fractured in multiple surfaces and shapeshifts according to the viewer’s engagement with the work. Agam takes Vasarely’s concept of optical distortion one step further by blurring the boundaries between painting and sculpture.Today, both Vasarely and Agam are hailed as pioneering icons of Post-War Art. Their ground-breaking approaches to art making continue to inspire new generations of artists to push the boundaries of what is possible, challenging conventions and revolutionising both Kinetic and Abstract Lenticular art by redefining the way we perceive and interact with art.",Vasarely/Agam: In Pursuit of Op,"21 Conduit Street, W1S 2XP",Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, 6 Mar  - 30 Aug 2024

The exhibited artists challenge the Western canon by overtly reconfiguring renowned paintings to include Black protagonists or, more covertly, portraying figures in poses reminiscent of pre-twentieth-century European portraiture. Certain works also demonstrate a tendency among Black artists to distort, simplify, or caricature the image of a Black person – either to draw attention to negative stereotypes or to imagine Black bodies extending beyond imposed limitations.In the wake of the Black Lives Matter Movement in 2020, the exhibition places importance on voices that have historically been disregarded. Although figuration has been constant throughout art history, figurative work by Black artists only recently rose to prominence. Such work contributes to the understanding of racialised experiences and the diverse self-perceptions of Black people.This exhibition contributes to the ongoing conversations around the position of figuration by Black artists. Curator, Alayo Akinkugbe, states that “it is crucial to acknowledge that this exhibition doesn’t exist in isolation but is, in part, a response to events leading up to and since 2020 which have opened up more space for dialogues around Blackness.” Opera Gallery invites you to take part in this critical conversation with ‘The Whole World Smiles with You.’",The Whole World Smiles With You,"65-66 New Bond Street, W1S 1RW",Mon-Sat 10am-6.30pm, 29 May  - 26 Jun 2024

Since the 1990s, he has pursued a meticulous and disciplined daily drawing practice, creating works whose vivid images are filled with poetry and observation; while each individual drawing is an intimate gem in its own right, it also serves as part of an incredible over-arching and open-ended narrative. Londoño’s work has previously been shown at institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the 2013 Venice Biennale. The curator of this year’s edition, Adriano Pedrosa, also included his work at the XXIV Bienal de São Paulo, 1999, and in the exhibition F[r]icciones, 2000, at Museo Reina Sofía, Madrid.In 2014, Londoño decided to structure his year through a series of weekly themes, dedicating his daily drawings to a particular subject; the exhibition includes drawings from each of the 52 weeks. The artist selected the diverse range of subjects having looked back on his previous work over the years and identified recurring themes and topics he wished to revisit. The first weeks of the year are represented by Planos (Blueprints), Personajes (Characters), Wallpapers, and Cajas (Boxes); other subjects include El Conejo (The Rabbit), Vestidos (Dresses), Cielos Oscuros (Dark Skies), Perros (Dogs), La Línea Punteada (The Dotted Line), Jacob y el Angel (Jacob and the Angel), Canciones (Songs), Barcos (Boats), Dirigibles (Airships), and Abstracto (Abstract). For over three decades on the 19th of each month, Londoño has drawn Edgar Degas, one of his greatest artistic heroes, who was born on 19 July 1834. Week 39 is titled Le Maître Absolut, Degas (The Absolute Master, Degas) and includes three drawings inspired by the great French Impressionist.Through his lifelong devotion to drawing, Londoño’s work takes inspiration from a dazzling variety of visual and textual sources. From illustrations, paper scraps and photographs (JASL does not own a computer) to classical texts and pop songs, the artist synthesises these with a methodology born of his scientific training, and his childhood obsession with an illustrated Larousse encyclopaedic dictionary. Celebrated in his homeland, and hugely influential on a younger generation of Colombian artists, including Johanna Calle, Mateo López, Nicolás Paris, and Bernardo Ortiz, Londoño’s work can be found in museum collections including those of MoMA and the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the Courtauld Gallery in London and the Albertina in Vienna. He continues to live in his hometown of Medellín, Colombia, and for the last twenty years, he has run a weekly portrait-drawing group there, as well as printing his etchings at a local workshop.","José Antonio Suárez Londoño.

Pace,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/kiki-kogelnik-the-dance/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Kiki Kogelnik,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/kiki-kogelnik/,"This exhibition, whose title draws inspiration from the allegorical Danse Macabre, or the Dance with Death, will include works across various mediums that are emblematic of Kogelnik’s profound exploration of the future possibilities—and perils—of outer space, and her relationship to the altered and abstracted twentieth-century body. Incorporating work spanning three decades of production, The Dance showcases Kogelnik’s unique, futuristic visual language as a means in which to communicate the universal fragility of terrestrial life.Kogelnik's singular visual language of weightless bodies, geometric repetition, and vibrant, neon colours defies categorisation. Born in Austria in 1935, she relocated to New York in the early 196Os, where she was introduced to artists including Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, and Tom Wesselmann. Charged by the city's artistic vitality-set against the pervasive background of the Cold War and Space Race-Kogelnik's practice surged into a prolific phase of creative development. Alongside her distinctive 'Kiki' style of painting, her assemblages proposed mechanical augmentation of the body as a means of survival, using novel materials such as sheet vinyl, plastics, and fibreglass. A shift in Kogelnik's work throughout the course of the 197Os and 8Os saw her treatment of the female body become more pronounced, concurrent with her growing dissatisfaction of the artistic scene's 'boys club'. With dynamic fluidity across paintings, works on paper, and ceramics, her explicit commentaries on the representations of women in modern society are imbued with an irony, critique, and pessimism that diverge ideologically from the canonical Pop art of her counterparts.Pace's upcoming exhibition in London will include a suite of chromatic paintings that speak to Kogelnik's fascination with space travel and her desire to be free. Bomb for Alfonso (1962), last seen at the 59th Biennale di Venezia, Brutal in Outer Space (c. 1962-63), and Untitled (Skull) (1960-63), encapsulate Kogelnik's mixed sentiments to the burgeoning technologies of the 1960s. In these paintings, silhouetted figures and disembodied limbs hover amongst falling bombs, pink skulls, and flattened silver spheres. Any sense of morbidity suggested by their composition is offset by their gleefully psychedelic palette of teals, tangerines, crimsons, and mauves.From 1964, Kogelnik began incorporating objects onto the surface of her canvases as three-dimensional augmentation to the bodies they depicted. Artificial Man and Artificial Woman (both 1965), two paintings not seen since the artist's solo exhibition in 1965 at the Austrian Institute, New York, have recently been reassembled and will also be on view. A long, twisting hose hangs from the chest of the orange male form, who, additionally, sports four arms and a disconnected limb suggestive of a 'spare part'. In lieu of an internal organ, a clear, plastic love heart is affixed to the green wire that is encased in the piping. A similar length of tube extends from the torso of the entirely deconstructed female figure, as she floats amidst her three arms and four legs.To create these life-size forms that populate her paintings, Kogelnik traced around bodies-sometimes her own, and sometimes those of her acquaintances-in a process akin to photography that she described as 'taking'. Enhancing their mechanistic quality, the tape Kogelnik used to secure her cutouts remains delineated, suggesting that the figures and their extra limbs resemble both garments for paper dolls and integral components of a larger machine.In a large-scale sculpture included in the exhibition, titled Seventh Ave. People (1986), flat, outlined bodies produced on sheet vinyl drape on hangers that suspend from a clothing rail, perhaps suggesting that identity is something that can be slipped on or off at will. Kogelnik's first studio in New York was not far from the Garment District on 7th Avenue, whose rush of clothing racks, tailors, and designers was a dynamic source of inspiration for the artist. Uncoupled from distinctions of sex, gender, or race, these vibrantly coloured cutouts offer the joy of Kogelnik's world and sixties-era utopianism. Yet, the threat of death in this-and Kogelnik's other hanging works-cannot be escaped. Like flayed skins, these depleted bodies portend a post-atomic world that is subject at any moment to weapons of mass destruction. By fusing the imagery of memento mori with symbolically optimistic materials, like vinyl, Kogelnik's works manifest life and death on the edge of destruction.For Kogelnik, the body that would survive the future was something that could be engineered, cloned, and automated. Like her cutouts, she produced figurative imprints using anatomically accurate stamps of the body, bone structure, circulatory system, and inner organs. A body of twelve drawings included in The Dance that feature these stamps portray their eponymous Robots in narrative sequence: their creation; their ascension into space and journey to other planets; the nirvana of celestial travel and their subsequent transformation; and finally, their fall and destruction. Circles permeate these works, from the glowing spheres around which body parts orbit, to smaller, clustered beads redolent of medical blister packs.In the early 1970s, Kogelnik departed from depictions of androgynous bodies, instead sourcing her models from advertisements or fashion editorials, and focusing on the archetypes of femininity circulated in mass media. The painting On the Beach (1973), included in the exhibition, imitates the wide format of a billboard: like shop mannequins, the women in this painting model swimwear and summer dresses while holding stiff, unnatural poses. Like the ceramics also on view, their faces are mask-like. Blank, cutout eyes, boldly outlined lips, and smooth, flat surfaces assert the artificiality of the female ideal. Just as Kogelnik envisioned Space utopias, she likewise revealed the culturally constructed expectations of women's bodies as fantasy, otherwise expressed by her often-repeated maxim, ""art comes from artificial, because it is not nature.""Concurrent with The Dance, Kogelnik is the subject of a major retrospective at Kunsthaus Zurich, on through July 14, 2024. In Paris, three ceramic sculptures by the artist are included in the exhibition Le monde comme ii va (The World as It Goes), at The Pinault Collection, Bourse de commerce, on through September 2, 2024.",Kiki Kogelnik: The Dance,"5 Hanover Square, W1S 1HQ",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 24 May  - 3 Aug 2024

Mobilising his own subject position - a white Western male - he becomes the embodiment of this troubling industry. Wearing sculptures made from secondhand clothes sourced in West Africa, he becomes a spectre of waste colonialism. In these monstrous incarnations, his flesh remains visible: a white hand, leg or foot. In simple terms, he performs his own whiteness.For this new development in the work, the artist will divide the gallery in two:The main space will feature an installation of effigies. This consists of dozens of figurines assembled from secondhand textiles; each one a miniature icon of the Dead White Man. Presented in a kind of wrongheaded museological display, these objects reference the ritual use of anthropomorphic totems, whose curative function operates through performance. Fashioned from clothes primarily sourced in the street markets of West Africa, this installation resurrects that material - returning it to the consumer delirium of London’s West End.This ethic of resurrection continues throughout the exhibition. In the second room of the gallery, a projected video sees the Dead White Man reverse the secondhand supply chain. Rising from a Senegalese street market, he wanders the city of Dakar until he arrives at the international port. Shipped back to the United Kingdom, he then haunts the shopping malls, textile recycling plants and corporate HQs of fast fashion brands. In the process, Hutchison performs his own entanglement with the network of processes that sustain the secondhand clothing industry. In doing so, he contests its claims to charity and sustainability, presenting it instead as a form of zombie imperialism.ContextDead White Man has been in development since 2017. It began with Hutchison’s invitation to attend an artist residency at Raw Material Company - a contemporary art platform in Dakar, Senegal. Throughout the subsequent years, he returned to Dakar to produce video and photographic work, while developing an extensive collaboration with The Or Foundation, a Ghanaian activist group based in Kantamanto (the largest secondhand market in the world).Exhibitions & MediaThe first chapter of this work was exhibited towards the end of 2023 at the British Textile Biennial. This included sculpture, performance, video, installation, billboards and workshops. The work has received global media attention, featuring in The Guardian, Dazed, The Times, The Daily Telegraph, KingKong, Creative Review, Vogue Business, among others.Jeremy Hutchison (b.1979) is a British artist based in London. Working across performance, sculpture, text and video he intervenes in systems of production and consumption, perverting norms to produce crisis and absurdity. Much of his work intervenes in consumer culture, subverting the mechanisms that sustain it: the language, media and labour practices. This results in a kind of radical nonsense, plunged into the smooth logic of capitalism. In a context of planetary catastrophe, he is committed to the potential of art to intervene; to challenge dominant structures and propose alternatives to an absurd status quo.His exhibitions include the ICA, Modern Art Oxford, Fondazione Prada, EVA Biennale, Z33, Casino Luxembourg, Kunstverein Wiesbaden, Lisson Gallery, Victoria & Albert Museum, Jerwood Space, Kunstverein Harburger Bahnhof, Museum of Contemporary Art Arlington, British Textile Biennial, Budapest Design Biennale, Qalandiya Biennale, Korean Cultural Centre and Southbank Centre.

In various states of repose, her protagonists inhabit palatial spaces with self-possession and ease, in turn demanding that the viewer reckon with the direction of their own gaze. Do these figures pose for our gratification or their own? Are their brazen stares invitations or predatory?The exhibition takes ‘Villa Venus’, the chain of brothels described in Vladimir Nabokov’s novel, Ada or Ardor (1969), as its point of departure to explore the staging of fantasy and eroticism, and broader questions of autonomy, freedom, artifice and fetishism. In Nabokov’s novel, an architect builds a chain of decadent, temple-inspired brothels across the world, realising the fantasies drafted in his late grandson’s erotic journals. The architect’s ‘parodies of paradise’ soon crumble into nefarious dens of squalor and, like the garden mazes through which patrons would access Villa Venus, this staging of another’s Eden becomes a wasteland of weeds.In her paintings, Mitsola also acts as an architect of fantasy, constructing opulent temples reminiscent of seraglios, bath houses or boudoirs for her siren-like figures. Employing the spatial logic of set design from the 1960s, Mitsola’s environments share the flatness of the stage, where a whole world can be built upon the surface of things. Up close, the onlooker, becoming aware of the performance, must accept their complicity in the suspension of disbelief, upon which all modes of fantasy rely. In the small room at the back of the gallery, Mitsola extends this element of set-building, constructing a draped, temple-like setting to house a new animation. Softened by hanging chiffon, the painted columns and caryatids from her paintings extend into this space, inviting the viewer into the imagined architecture.A rose is present in several works on display; most evidently in Mitsola’s sculpture, her nod to a scene in Ada, where the young narrator visits a shop specialising in the reproduction of antiques and objets d’art. The narrator is perturbed by the unexpected sensation of a real flower hiding among a  bunch of imitation crimson roses. In this emporium of artifice and counterfeit, the outlier is the genuine object. In Mitsola’s paintings, the viewer is led through a similar hall of mirages and double images. Interrogating the concept of utopia and its inherent contradictions, the artist builds a seductive world that situates scenes of her protagonist’s liberation within constrictive frameworks.",Sofia Mitsola: Villa Venus: The Garden,"2 Savile Row, W1S 3PA","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 5 Jun  - 20 Jul 2024

Pippy Houldsworth Gallery,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/liorah-tchiprout-what-i-corrupted-was-what-is-called-the-truth/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",,,"In What I corrupted was what is called the truth… the artist stages her miniature paintings within an intimate yet uncanny studio setting, casting her dolls as actors in a scene that is equal parts personal diorama, cabinet of curiosities, and tableau vivant. A space complete with miniature versions of real objects found in her studio - cigarettes, Jane Austen novels, ersatz Tiffany lamp, prepared canvases, and a pot of brushes - the artist plays with shifting scales to create an intimate view of her studio practice.Presented in public for the first time, Tchiprout’s dolls are central to her practice, the basis of a self-referential realm from which the artist draws her subject matter. Building upon a wooden mannequin base, or covering her own metal wire armatures, Tchiprout’s figures are animated through modelling clay, human or animal hair, and handmade clothing. These dolls form the basis of her painterly compositions, groups of figures that bow their weighty heads, emotive in their slack physicality.As Tchiprout paints the dolls they mediate her experience of painting from life. Modelled after Tchiprout herself, or close family and friends, the dolls establish a visual shorthand for the artist, a set of motifs and expressions that are distillations or signifiers of real human figures, yet are also unreal in their upholstered lifelessness, abject in their departure from their subjects. In What I corrupted was what is called the truth…, the doll wearing black is modelled after the artist and made with cuttings of her own hair. Likewise, the artist symbiotically takes on the persona and appearance of her dolls. In this way, Tchiprout’s dolls and her subsequent paintings span opposite concepts of real and imaginary, living and inanimate, forming a closed circuit of self-referential observation and world-building.Having established her practice in printmaking, the artist’s transition to painting and sculpture also bears evidence of the mark-making of her earlier monoprints and etchings. Tchiprout considers how light arranges itself across the roughly hewn surface of the dolls’ faces, shadows falling into the concave impressions of her finger-marks in much the same way that tactile gesture informs her monoprints.Influenced by themes of longing and anticipation in the literature of of Yiddish women writers such as Rachel Korn and Miriam Karpilove, and drawing from the bold female protagonists in French American author Anaïs Nin’s novels, in this installation Tchiprout’s asks whether the spatial dynamics of replicating one’s studio and oneself on a miniature scale can metaphorically relate to the exterior and interior experience of womanhood, the secret multitudes contained within. The artist blurs what is real and what is idealistic within her mimetic presentation of herself and her practice. In presenting a hermetic loop of feedback between herself and her dolls, she questions where the truth may lie in a secure image of safety and interiority.Liorah Tchiprout (b. 1992, London) lives and works in London. She received her MA from Camberwell College of Art, London (2020), and earned her BA in Fine Art Printmaking at University of Brighton (2016).

The artist’s original encounter with place and atmosphere is translated into a modified visual code for us to decipher. She uses a sumptuous range of vibrant, almost psychedelic colour to accentuate a feeling of heightened perception. Her contribution to the exhibition consists of paintings inspired by such sublime geography and a ‘spatial intervention’ in the form of a wall painting.Tõnis Saadoja deploys a controlled, programmatic method. He documents his response to personal source material in two discrete sets of paintings: small pictures of skies and larger ones of architecture. He deploys a different technique for each. The skies are rendered with a full-colour palette in a naturalistic mode of representation, while the architectural subjects are graphically described in a minimal range of muted hues which emphasises flatness and a sense of cool detachment. The subtlety and nuance of his picture-making evokes a romantic atmosphere, an echo of lost summer skies.Each artist displays a strong attachment to a sense of place, articulated through sophisticated manipulations typical of their respective practises. Kongi makes a directly expressive response, mediated by compositional devices. Saadoja essays thoughtful enquiries into the controlled presentation of content.

Certainly, in respect to her previous exhibition, the strength and brightness of colour has become bolder and filled with positivity and joy which is surely related to the wonders of childhood which the artist is currently experiencing to the full. This has awakened in the artist, extremes of sensation and emotion but coupled with hope and fear. ‘Rawness, honesty and vulnerability meets protective shells that can be seen bursting open in these works’. (Araminta Blue)Nature is an ever-present in these works, particularly wind, water and light yet also birth and pain.Araminta Blue’s paintings have always featured space as much as gesture. There are moments of great intensity allied to other moments of extreme calm. Hands and legs appear out of gesture and abstraction. In ‘Red Sun’ the extended arms reach upwards to the heat and light of the red sun but within the same work there are various branches from unseen trees, everything co-existing in the same space.In ‘Sea Bed’, the gestures are denser and wilder with an arm and hand emerging from what appears to be the seabed with fishes also prominent.In ‘Sea’, the artist creates a richly and very expressively painted face, lying on her back in a maelstrom of movement and rich, lush colour that recalls Burne-Jones’s ‘Ophelia’. This iconic image also casts its shadow over the painting ‘Light Filters Through’ and ‘Sunrise’. However,there is yes aping a previous work but more a subtle acknowledgement towards the history of art and more specifically British art.The freedom of gesture, assured handling of paint and colour makes her appear to be an artist with far greater years to her career . ‘Sunrise’ is a case in point where another beautifully painted head full of strong colours is lying on what appears to be a sea, whilst above a bright sun is bringing it’s light to a new day. Whereas ‘Sunrise’ is bathed in a golden light, ‘Cold Sun’ as the title suggests is icy cold, the sun, a shining white light, with an elongated blue figure diving down away from the light.The largest painting on view is the triptych ‘Light and Time’ where, on the central panel, a reclining body is lying down, whilst on the top of the canvas a hand and what could be a long leg reach out to the first panel where a fading sun looks over a hazy landscape.The element of nature intermingled with human hands dominates the third and last part of the work. With the increased ambition of size, the artist has created a very brave and ambitious mixture between painterly gesture and empty space.There is a palpable sense of movement and of everything being in flux in these paintings with the figures nearly always reaching upwards or downwards towards the light or away from the light . The ‘energy’ the artist speaks of is readily visible and helps give the works their originality.In this, only her second solo exhibition in the gallery, Blue has produced a great leap forward from ‘Silt’, her first show. Both the freedom with which she uses space and the highly original way she has found to allow figuration to appear mysteriously out of abstraction, belie an artist who is continually trying to the boundaries of her practice.Araminta Blue was born 1990 in Cyprus. She currently lives and works in London.Blue graduated with a Master’s in painting from the Slade School of Art in 2019 and holds a BA Hons from Ruskin School of Art. She has received numerous accolades including the Artists Collecting Society Studio Prize and was shortlisted for the Chadwell Award, Derek Hill Scholarship and the Hix Award. Blue’s works have been presented in various solo and group exhibitions across the UK. Her recent works have been showcased in Christie’s and Bonhams London.Araminta Blue is interested in how the imagined space can be used as an escape and protection from our ‘reality’, whilst at the same time it can help us view the real experience with an added clarity.The oil paint is either diluted to act like watercolour, applied in washes, scrubbed with rags or thickened to a clay or cement-like consistency that is slicked and scratched. The canvas is treated like a drawing on paper: the process of making the work is open to the viewer in the translucent layers and visibly scrubbed out marks. The subjects weave together, emerging and dissolving into the canvas.Colliding different uses of paint and adapting forms help to express fragmented bodily sensation. Parts of figures are seen as fragile, vulnerable, transient - pieces are missing, absorbed into the setting. Other parts are more vibrant and energetic with intense colour. Then other areas have a sense of strength, protective armour or shell-like layers. The subjects are familiar yet unplaceable, allowing for interpretative narratives.",Araminta Blue: Sun Wreck,"37 Rathbone Street, W1T 1NZ",Mon-Sat 11am-6pm, 10 May  - 15 Jun 2024

The canvases are imbued with symbolic motifs such as aircraft, guns and open scripture that act as visual signifiers to prompt important questions around the dissemination of truth and violence. Representative of the artist’s signature style, his works are filled with contorted figures with overlapping limbs and withering bodies, whilst exploring the notion of family and the domestic setting. His subjects embody both strength and weakness. The figures proudly display their scars, symbolic of the battles they’ve conquered. Simultaneously, the translucency of their bodies displays a certain vulnerability as they’re laid bare to the viewer. A focus on portraiture and figurative painting reveals the artist’s classical education and early inspiration from traditional Ethi-opian iconography. Urgessa’s works are occupied with question around race, the politics of identi-ty, and the psychological tension hidden within domestic settings, as the artist carefully addresses these contemporary issues and confronts them in his tremendous paintings.Tesfaye Urgessa comments, “I want my figures to have almost an emotional vulnerability...

Caroline Achaintre, Anna Higgins, Niamh O’Malley, Aimée Parrott, Stephen PolatchThe exhibition takes its title from a term in grammar which exists beyond a familiar distinction between the active and passive voices. Although the middle voice is not formally marked in English (as it is in classical Greek and Sanskrit) it is present in our language and allows to map out a multi-specied agency, away from a human-centric assumption of mankind as ‘actors’ in an ‘inert’ natural environment. Evident in such verbs as ‘observe’, ‘witness’ or ‘partake’, middle voice suggests an efficacy that both receives and twists. That is, middle voice denotes actions where the subject is not anterior to the field of action, coming before it takes place, but rather interior to it, inextricably part of the way in which it unfolds (another example in modern language is ‘je suis n’, ‘I am born’). Distinct from an inherent hierarchy between an ‘agent’ and ‘patient’ characteristic of active and passive voices, middle-voiced expression thus acknowledges the profound entanglement of human and non-human, the simultaneity of acting and being acted upon in the world.Bringing together works by Caroline Achaintre, Anna Higgins, Niamh O’Malley, Aimée Parrott, Stephen Polatch, the exhibition explores the possibility of expressing a middle-voiced view in visual terms – locating the ineffable sense of push/pull with the external world, felt in materials, mark-making process, or in the presence of the work in space.Executed from thin slabs of clay, Caroline Achaintre’s ceramic sculptures appear to rise, ripple and coil into three-dimensional forms, as if animated by a presence. Gently bending partially dry sheets of clay, the artist is led by its physical properties, continually negotiating and responding to the inherent malleability and brittleness. In each work Achaintre impresses the surface with patterns evocative of tree barks, shells or animal skin, constructing a sense of a porous, moist, breathing being. At once seductive and strange, the glistening curves of her sculptures lock our gaze, creating an anticipation of motion and exchange.Painstakingly building his compositions by layering contrasting marks, Stephen Polatch flexes the scale and momentum of each object, creating a sense of equivalence between the human and non-human. Inhabiting familiar cityscapes, his figures are manifestly in mysterious interdependence with their surroundings, on par with plants, architecture and bodies of water. In Tulips, a flower towers over and rhymes with the bending figure, underscored by concealed letters spelling out ‘tulips’ along the bottom of the composition. Each object here appears in motion, dissolving our conceptions of causation and what constitutes an ‘actor’ in space.Aimée Parrott works into unprimed support, interweaving dyeing, mark-making and stitching together of multiple canvases, to imbue the surface with a living, membrane-like quality. Fusing sinuous lines with staccato pointillist mark-making, the works tie in suggestions of micro and marco, cellular processes, sea organisms or landscapes seen from afar, often projecting a sense of pulsating expansion. Employing monotype technique as a starting point in her compositions, Parrott balances free gestures with a lack of complete control; she says, “in beginning a painting I like to imagine just enabling it to arrive, being receptive to materials and circumstance almost like a conduit.”In Niamh O’Malley’s considered sculptures in wood, stone, metal and glass, one encounters a lure of the familiar and an impulse for touch. Warm curving surfaces combine with lucid planes and right angles, highlighting the power of materials to shift our experience of safety, communality and belonging, both in private and public spaces. Comprising a banister-like form adjacent to a delicate composition in glass and wood, Blind (2023) inflects our movement, drawing us in yet physically resisting a close encounter. O’Malley’s glass works at once admit and refract light, responding to and transforming the space around them, slowly revealing the modes of seeing along and through the translucent surface.Layering fields of colour with silhouettes and shadows of familiar objects, Anna Higgins’ cinematic works seem lit from within, evoking shapes experienced after looking at the sun or discerned in dimming light. In Night, the outlines of leaves and tree branches come in and out of focus upon extended looking, oscillating between recognition and doubt, and thus probing the veracity of human vision. Iterating marks in watercolour and chalk pastel with photographic transfers and waves of light captured through the lens, Higgins works intuitively, seeking to step beyond the rational towards the ‘felt’, conjuring a sense of affect and mysticism in natural forms.Text by Maria HinelHeader image: Caroline Achaintre.

Choosing the exhibition title for its personal resonance. Fang explains that it is about both the ‘external and internal’, alluding to the danger presented to us and that we present to society.After moving to New York City at the age of eighteen, Fang was exposed to the gestural and expressive abstractions of Willem de Kooning, Cecily Brown and Jackson Pollock, whose drip paintings in particular opened her eyes to the possibilities of painting. Understanding it to be a bodily experience, Fang loses herself in the rhythmic flowing forms which are unpredictable yet beautifully harmonious, describing the entire process as akin to running a marathon. In this way, the cathartic act of painting facilitates the release of unrestrained emotions through the physicality of the medium. Not only do her prodigious paintings reflect the anxieties inherent to New York, but they are also an outlet for the artist’s residual childhood frustrations of feeling at odds with the strict rules in place within Asian culture.The exhibition centres on both the literal and metaphorical associations of water. The title, Dangerous Waters, refers to the tumultuous and uncertain world we live in. Yet, on another level, it highlights water as a spatially divisive body, separating continents with vast oceans, which paintings like Sea Storm or Frozen Waves 02 evoke. Drawn to repetitive organic formations, Fang’s oeuvre conjures strong oceanic associations, cautioning the viewer with undertones of danger as hinted in the painting’s titles, such as Dark Clouds 02 or Dark Forest Strolling. From the artist’s birthplace in coastal Shenzhen to the East River in New York, water holds a particular significance to the artist, a familiarity that shines through in the energy and fluidity of her paintings.Interlaced with feminity, Dangerous Waters explores traditional Chinese associations between women and water. The character Jia Baoyu in Dream of the Red Chamber (1791) said, ‘Women are like water, possessing spirituality like water, goodness like water, resilience like water, and tenderness like water.’ These feminine associations carry through into Fang’s paintings as she explores the symbolism between the two. On the one hand, women are associated with the life-giving properties of water, yet Fang also understands ‘dangerous waters’ to be an allegory for the volatility of feminine desire, both in strength and devastation. Accented with dusty pink hues, Lady’s Eardrops masterfully reflects the female experience, using shades of pinks, peaches and reds to celebrate the power of women. Indeed, the colour palette across the series carries meaningful connotations; where pink refers to female desire blue signifies water.Characterised by lyrical and bodily swirls, Yuan Fang’s paintings simultaneously envelop the viewer into an unruly web and elicit soulful contemplations on our civilisation, be that the uncertainty pervasive in today’s geopolitical climate or the broader associations surrounding water as a symbolic entity. Expanding on the multi-layered complexities of her painting, Fang explains that ‘I always wanted to depict a sense of turbulence or chaos which mimics the living condition of human beings.’",Yuan Fang: Dangerous Waters,"8 Bennet Street, SW1A 1RP","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 10am-5pm", 30 May  - 12 Jul 2024

Since the late 1990s, Cinthia Marcelle has been creating material- intensive and performative installations and video works, many of them made in partnership with Tiago Mata Machado, as poetic-metaphorical images that question conventional ways of perceiving and behaving, how we see the world and our role in it, and disrupt habitual routines and categorizing patterns. Marcelle repeatedly blurs the supposedly fixed binary opposition of concepts such as order– chaos, fiction–reality, rule–exception, submission–resistance, or inside–outside. She points out that conventions and norms are never fixed and that the meaning of things always depends on the specific perspective and context of consideration.The exhibition at Sprovieri is centered on the eponymous installation em-entre-para-perante #2 [in- between-to-towards #2] (2015/2024), which was created for her survey exhibition “Disobedient Tools” at Marta Herford Museum in 2023 and is re-staged here. It is a new version of a work that she had originally developed in 2015 for the gallery Silvia Cintra + Box4 in Rio de Janeiro.em-entre-para-perante #2 consists of a floor installation made of metal objects that are bound with black shoelaces and arranged in a grid-like formation, six “paintings” and two clipboards with fax printouts hanging on the wall.The shape of the objects on the floor suggests that they could have been employed to break open or break out of something. Here, however, they lie carefully wrapped in black shoelaces, thereby robbed of their potential function as tools. The binding and bandaging is a protective, caring gesture that gives them a cult-like quality. The once hard, cold metal tools become warm and dysfunctional objects. Their object status and thus their meaning have changed.The neutralized “tools” are framed by six painting-like works on the wall – a continuation of a line of work that runs through the artist's entire oeuvre in various forms: Single-colored, vertically striped cotton sheet of which the artist manually paints the machine-printed stripes with white paint. The vertical stripes of the fabric might evoke associations with the bars of a prison, which are seemingly canceled out by the white paint; thus, the act of overpainting appears like an act of liberation. As Cinthia lifts the contrast of the stripes, she disorganizes the fabric's defining pattern – a thoroughly political gesture, not least because of the political connotations of the colors. The width of the stripes, identical to that of the laces, also creates a connection between the neutralized stripes of the painting and those that defuse the tools. Marcelle never stretches her “paintings” on frames, in the manner typical of the Western painting tradition. Marcelle subverts the expectations of painting, which in the Western painting tradition usually takes the form of stretched canvases on frames. Instead, she knots her canvases, hangs them on two corners like drying laundry, or presents them hanging on wooden slats like flags. In other instances, they are bound together in a bundle or are tied around architectural structures. The canvas, which is traditionally a picture support, is transformed by Marcelle into a sculptural object, for example to mark something.The third component of the installation has its own title: Manifesto (2023/24). Every day the artist sends a fax to the gallery with the same image of a manhole into which a rope disappears, that is then attached to a clipboard on top of the previous day's version. Over the course of the exhibition, the dated daily printouts accumulate, whereby the image-defining black on the light-sensitive fax paper increasingly fades due to the impact of external factors. For the first time, Marcelle decided to present here not only the faxes that are arriving daily over the duration of this presentation. She is now also displaying the collection of 115 faxes that arrived and were collected over the corresponding period of its previous presentation at Marta Herford. Both Manifestos are a materialization of the temporal component of the respective work.In the creation of em-entre-para-perante, the work of the legendary Brazilian artist Arthur Bispo do Rosário was a key reference for Cinthia Marcelle. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, Bispo do Rosário spent decades in a psychiatric clinic in Rio de Janeiro, where people were admitted who were considered ""abnormal"" due to a mental disorder or alcoholism and were therefore marginalized. Over the course of nearly five decades, he created an extensive body of work in which he disassembled the uniforms of the supervisory staff and used the yarn to wrap objects found in the clinic or to embroider bed sheets. The resulting works can be read as Bispo’s encyclopedic chronicle of his view of this world and the hereafter. The utilization and distortion of uniforms become a symbolic act of liberation and the basis for the self-determined formation of new narratives. They are a manifestation of his resistance to the pressure of conformity to the normative structures of society.Cinthia Marcelle alludes in em-entre-para-perante #2 to the same metaphor of imprisonment and escape from it to reflect on how hegemonic systems of knowledge hold us back like walls of jail and determine and limit our thinking. The (visual) determinants of binary opposites, through which a certain idea or narrative is formulated and reproduced, are broken down in several ways. Clear attributions become shaky. The functionality of tools and the capacity to create order through the use of rational categories is defused.In her essay Disobedient Tools (1) (2018), Mexican author Gabriela Jauregui speaks of language as a constructive means of escaping entrenched modern, patriarchal systems of thought and dismantling them. She argues that speech is not merely a passive product of a social system and its thought structures but actively shapes this system and can bring about long-term social change. It is therefore up to us to use language as a tool, to adopt it in order to actively shape new thought patterns.Anna Roberta Goetz(1) Gabriela Jaurequi, “Herramientas Desobedientes” in TSUNAMI (Mexico City, 2018), pp.87-100.Credits:em-entre-para-perante [in-between-to-towards]The work was produced with the support of the “Marta Patronage Fund for New Art""Coordination and production: Aline TimaAssistants: Hellena Kuasne, João Leonardo Bordignon (paintings)Ava Miranda, Dominic Stephenson, Julie Mons, Michaela Tibaldo (objects)RhymesReview: Alyne Azuma",Cinthia Marcelle: em-entre-para-perante [in-between-to-towards],"23 Heddon Street, W1B 4BQ",Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, 5 Apr  - 21 Jun 2024  
Sprüth Magers London,London West End,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/john-baldessari-ahmedabad-1992/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",John Baldessari,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/john-baldessari/,"In the early weeks of 1992, Baldessari was invited to live and work in the expansive compound of the Sarabhai family, Indian industrialists and patrons of the arts, in the Shahibaug district of Ahmedabad. Members of the prominent family formally set up the residency in the 1970s, but the Sarabhais were interacting with artists, designers and architects long beforehand. Like many patrons and cultural protagonists of post- independence India, they actively engaged with foreign artists and established international networks, hoping to restrain revivalist currents and promote a new vision for the country. Following several other established artists, among them his close friend Lynda Benglis, Baldessari resided in the Villa Sarabhai, a red brick and concrete open-plan house designed by Le Corbusier in the 1950s.The rarely seen multi-panelled works that stem from Baldessari’s stay are a direct response to his new surroundings, which were inspiring and overwhelming in equal measure and had a lasting impact on the artist’s oeuvre. The collages are composed of his own photographs, some enhanced by paint; an eclectic mix of found imagery; rubber mudflaps painted by local sign painters; Formica pieces modelled after parts of local motorised rickshaws; and printed handmade paper collected from the Gandhi ashram in Ahmedabad. Immersing himself in Indian culture, the Californian photographed the bustling city at a time when India was subject to radical changes due to the emergence of new technologies, globalisation processes, and an influx of Westerners.The cleverly devised arrangements of Ahmedabad 1992 document this shift. Here, floating electronics in a futuristic cyberspace point towards the burgeoning technological revolution of the ’90s. There, a sense of motion and transition is reflected in the dominant motifs, including modes of transportation (motorbikes, bicycles, trucks), animals in movement (a cow trotting along the roadside or a bird in flight), and cricket being played or kites being flown. Also at constant play in the series is the alternating and interlacing of looking and being looked at, with several images either observing the action of street scenes or featuring a subject’s direct gaze, and sometimes both.Cornerstone aspects of Baldessari’s practice, like the mining of pre-existing imagery, fell on fertile ground in a place as visually spectacular as India. Images from magazines and the everyday are deconstructed and reassembled to stress their original ambiguity or curiousness. Figures are painted over, withdrawing the underlying information and complicating the reading of the image. Expanding on this sort of erasure, Baldessari produced the Removal Series (1995) shortly thereafter. Also employed in the present works is the use of dots to cover faces, a predominant feature of the artist’s work from the mid-1980s onward, which simultaneously draws the eye to the point of obfuscation and redirects the viewer towards other parts of the image. The resulting works, which Baldessari produced after his return to Santa Monica, expand beyond the sum of their parts and evoke the atmosphere and complexity of Indian scenery through associative juxtaposition.The artist’s signature wry humour gives way to a surprisingly raw view of everyday settings. Entered into new contexts, they are recoded and refuse immediate answers, allowing viewers to generate their own responses. The residency provided him with a unique opportunity to not only observe a new environment, which in many ways contrasted his Los Angeles milieu, but also permitted him to turn a critical lens inward for a period of self-reflection. It is the works’ contingent quality—with each element modifying the next—Baldessari’s vibrant use of colour, and the keen eye of an outsider that render the Ahmedabad series an intimate commentary on what it means to look during a moment of reinvention.John Baldessari (1931–2020) lived and worked in Venice, California.

The artist’s writing flows through themes of dance, African diaspora, musical notation, literature, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and theoretical physics, invoking the guiding voices of the choreographer Katherine Dunham, composer Florence B. Price, theorist Saidiya Hartman, author Toni Morrison, and physicist Carlo Rovelli. Each of Davis’ bodies of work is a study in movement that translates photographs taken by the artist. Though composed on a flat page, Davis recognises her drawings as dimensional vessels, planes where she charts, layers, and reimagines significance.Two of Davis’ series are portrait-based: the first, grouped drawings of figures in various postures. During photo shoots for these studies, the artist invited Black women to come to her studio and improvise movement, capturing their gestures with long-exposure photographs resulting in kinetic, unbound physiques. Drawing closer to the work, portions of Davis’ essay emerge, detailing the extraordinary careers of Katherine Dunham and Florence B. Price, two trailblazing Black creatives of the twentieth century who used art to pursue individual and societal metamorphosis. As a choreographer, Dunham infused dance with her background in anthropology, using her body as a vehicle to express radical ideas about space, time, and diaspora. As the first Black female musician to compose for a national symphony orchestra, Price arranged music to navigate states of instability, transition, and freedom—such as in her rediscovered piece Clouds.Davis’ second portrait series features single drawings of figures framed with recessed mantles that display vessels of various proportions. Designed by the artist and carved by her partner, each of these sculptures was crafted from one of two types of wood: ebony from Ghana, where the artist lived for many years, and ash from Los Angeles, sourced from a tree at her home. These multimedia works can be likened to her series Text(tiles), multi-panel artworks that juxtapose portraits with woven fabrics, underscoring the etymological root of text from the Latin word “to weave.” Inserting a physical vessel into the image plane, she encourages her audience to comprehend that each dimension of the work has the capacity to hold meaning—literally and figuratively.The third series is a group of twelve drawings based on Davis’ snapshots of clouds. Building on the cloud as a symbolic muse for choreography and composition, she considers the natural formation through the lens of quantum physics. As a billowing mass made up of atomic particles, a cloud shifts between states of being solid, liquid, and gas—an element that fluctuates between the micro and macro. Drawing from Rovelli’s writings on the relativity of time, Davis’ compositions encourage her audience to question systems of artistry, science, philosophy, history, race, and gender for which meaning is assigned, not inherent. Welcoming shifting observations and evolving thoughts, her text and image reject an explicit reading.For each work, Davis arranges the text in a new formation to highlight different passages, incising the sculptural passages into a polymer plate, then embossing them onto paper with an etching press. She scores each parchment with a grid - rendering the photograph section by section - using sharpened carbon pencils for portrait works and powdered indigo pigments for cloud works. With an exacting and meticulous hand, she creates a surface that resembles an ancient rubbing, emphasising how light and dark shadows reveal - rather than conceal - essential ideas within her essay. Through the blurred focus of the body, the soft edges of the cloud, and the swelling surface of the vessel, Davis balances the rigid with the fluid; the frame and grid for each serve as structured systems wherein physical and meteorological bodies roam freely.",Kenturah Davis: clouds,"5-6 Cork Street, W1S 3LQ","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 31 May  - 20 Jul 2024

The Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange (ROCI), pronounced ‘Rocky’ after the artist’s pet turtle, foregrounds his conviction in art as a force for positive social change, along with the role of travel as a key catalyst for his characteristically experimental approach to materials and techniques.Spanning the entirety of the seven years of ROCI’s intense creative production, the exhibition at Thaddaeus Ropac London encompasses canvases, sculptures, cardboard works, neon light, photogravures and textiles, as well as an example of the artist’s earliest metal paintings. Presenting works directly from the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, this is the first gallery survey dedicated to ROCI since the conclusion of the project in 1991. The ROCI works, many of which are also shown publicly for the first time since the project ended, are contextualised with archival materials. A selection of the artist’s black-and-white photographs, taken as source material during his travels and used for the silkscreen images in the ROCI works, are also included. Together, these elements offer an unprecedented overview of one of the most ambitious and wide-reaching artistic interchanges of the late-20th century.I feel strong in my belief, based on my varied and widely traveled collaborations, that a one-to-one contact through art contains potent peaceful powers and is the most non-elitist way to share exotic and common information, seducing us into creative mutual understandings for the benefit of all. — Robert Rauschenberg, 1984Acutely aware of contemporary global tensions, Rauschenberg sought to realise a large-scale touring exhibition primarily in countries where access to contemporary Western art and freedom of artistic expression was limited or non-existent. Almost entirely funded by the artist, ROCI ultimately travelled to 10 countries outside of the United States: Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, China, Tibet, Japan, Cuba, the Soviet Union, Germany (Berlin) and Malaysia, concluding in the U.S. with the exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.Working with a small team, Rauschenberg undertook a research trip to each participating country ahead of the corresponding leg of the exhibition to visit sites of interest and meet with local artists, artisans and prominent cultural figures. He then returned to his studio in Captiva, Florida, where he translated his experiences into a new body of work, which was subsequently exhibited alongside the touring retrospective of the artist’s work and a selection of ROCI pieces from the previous countries. Each iteration of the exhibition consequently facilitated a dialogue between the participating countries through the works assembled, while simultaneously offering an overview of Rauschenberg’s practice to audiences who may have had little or no exposure to contemporary Western art.I couldn’t see clearly as an artist until I understood that it wasn’t the similarities that were important, it wasn’t the similarities that pulled things together, but it was the differences that made things interesting. — Robert Rauschenberg, 1986Meaningful contact with other cultures was an enduring source of inspiration for Rauschenberg throughout his career. He travelled internationally with artist Cy Twombly in the early 1950s and then again as a set and costume designer for the Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s world tour in 1964. He created a series of paper works with the artisans at an ancient Chinese paper mill in 1982. These travels and previous collaborations found expression in his artworks, which feature his pioneering experiments with materials and techniques and continue to inspire new generations of artists working today. It was in the course of his ROCI research trip to Chile that he began working on copper as a sign of solidarity with the Chilean people. The Copperhead-Bites / ROCI CHILE (1985) fuse artistic innovation with the artist’s desire to reflect the socio-political conditions of the people he encountered, many of whom worked in copper mines during the oppressive regime of dictator Augosto Pinochet. At the same time, the artist was cultivating his own artistic evolution, resulting in the production of 15 metal painting series over the following decade.Elsewhere in the exhibition, Rauschenberg’s use of materials gestures to continuity within his practice. For ROCI VENEZUELA he integrated three-dimensional found objects onto supports silkscreened with photographic imagery. Recalling his earlier Combines (1954–64), they blur the traditional boundaries between painting and sculpture, image and object. This non-hierarchical approach also finds expression in the ROCI TIBET sculptures assembled from everyday objects – chairs, a typewriter and a fire hydrant – as well as the cardboard boxes unfolded and arranged in a modernist cubic formation for ROCI MEXICO. In turn, hanging fabric works created for ROCI USSR recall the unstretched textile supports used for Rauschenberg’s solvent transfer images in the Hoarfrosts (1974–76) and the sewn fabric Jammers (1975–76), the latter inspired by a trip to a textile centre in Ahmedabad, India.ROCI also marked the artist’s return to direct silkscreening, a technique he had rarely used in painting since the early 1960s. While his earlier screenprinted paintings feature images taken from mass media, the ROCI works rely solely on his own photographs, which were primarily taken during ROCI research trips. Cropping, enlarging and colouring these images with ink, Rauschenberg layered them in complex compositions to draw unexpected resonances that reflect his own unique impression of the cultures and environments he encountered. Often juxtaposing these mechanically-reproduced images with hand-applied elements, such as splashes of acrylic paint and corrosives that bit into the metal supports, he further mediated the documentary material through his own artistic intervention.Art is educating, provocative, and enlightening even when first not understood. The very creative confusion stimulates curiosity and growth, leading to trust and tolerance. To share our intimate eccentricities proudly will bring us all closer. — Robert Rauschenberg, 1984At the conclusion of the ROCI project, Rauschenberg had created more than 125 paintings, sculptures and editioned objects and over two million visitors worldwide had seen a ROCI exhibition. In several of the countries he visited, ROCI was the first solo exhibition by a contemporary Western artist. Rauschenberg’s creative vision had a critical impact on a new global generation of artists, with many in China still referring to eras as ‘before-and-after Rauschenberg’.Presented in London at another moment of deep global uncertainty, this exhibition revisits ROCI to consider the power of international collaboration and cultural exchange in the 21st century. The exhibition is accompanied by an illustrated catalogue featuring an interview with contemporary artist Alvaro Barrington.I see the legacy of ROCI in part being the ability to look at other cultures, look at other countries, look at other people, and find your common humanity, and that’s what I would hope that people take away from viewing the works and the spirit of the project. — Julia Blaut, Senior Director of Curatorial Affairs at the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, New York.",Robert Rauschenberg: ROCI,"Ely House, 37 Dover Street, W1S 4NJ",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 24 Apr  - 15 Jun 2024

In her daily life, she opens herself up to communing with and closely observing the environment: the texture of lichen, a stream of water, a glimmer of moths, or the old-growth maple trees that grow beside her Vermont home. With a remarkable sensitivity to space, she beholds nature deeply, entering meditative states of unwavering attention. She sketches en plein air before returning to the studio to translate her impressions to the canvas using sustainable oil sticks. Blending her medium with her fingers, she takes a tactile, almost sculptural approach to pigment application, ensuring an uninterrupted connection between her mind and the canvas.Though her sketches involve careful observation, Pozanti doesn't seek to replicate the natural world. Rather, she aims to capture the world as she encounters it-as a sensate, dreaming, interpretive subject. As a result, her landscapes breathe with life. The painting A Dream Strayed Into Light (all works 2024), for example, features a gauzy path lined with ecstatic, jewel-toned flora, all seemingly uplifted by a gust of wind. In The Shimmering Shoulders of the World, an ambient beachscape at twilight is viewed through a fringe of undulating branches. Lips to Breathe Her Name centres on a limber flower whose petals recall feminine anatomy.“My paintings are love letters to the Earth,” the artist explains. “I make them to celebrate, remember, and immortalise the beauty of the natural world… As I exist within the world, everything in it exists within me. This feeling of oneness and the urgency to embrace it blossoms in my work.” Beneath the enchantment that characterises these paintings, however, there is an element of melancholy. By emphasising our indivisibility from nature and revelling in its beauty, Pozanti hopes to inspire care for our environment and for all that is nonhuman in our world.",Hayal Pozanti: Tender Mountain,"15 Bolton Street, W1J 8BG","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 25 Apr  - 2 Jun 2024

Greenhouse Trellising (mixed media, paper, mounted on canvas, 2023) is rendered from a photograph of Nyandoro. Inspired by botanical illustrations, this large-scale drawing with three-dimensional forms depicts the trellised plants and their fruits to reimagine the color, texture and condition of the plant and fruit forms. Chicken Run Setup (mixed media, paper, mounted on canvas, 2023) reflects the exponential rise of small-scale poultry rearing. Pfumvudza/Maize-cob Steelers (ink, paper mounted on wood panel, 2021) depicts a grower harvesting maize.At the juncture between the Upper and Lower Galleries is the work, Corner Glenara and Nelson Mandela Hustle (mixed media, paper, mounted on canvas, 2023), capturing the vendor activity around the intersections of Glenara and Nelson that connects the highway from Zimbabwe to Mozambique. The artist looks at the colors, forms and movement of the vendors with their goods which almost look like regalia.In the Lower Gallery, Locked Chill (paper and ink on wood panel, 2021) and Panorama (mixed media, paper mounted on canvas, 2023) draw together the polarities of movement between the enforced pandemic lockdown restrictions to curb spreading of the coronavirus and depicts Nyandoro's Uncle who became stranded. Panorama captures a lone 'spirit' figure onboard a fishing boat looking through a telescope for a missing population - an allegory that attests to the reported 84% (Population and Housing Census, 2022, ZIMSTAT, 2023) of the population that left Zimbabwe to look for employment elsewhere.Commerce is another focus present in the space. Here Nyandoro is influenced by the quotidian aesthetics of market-place advertisement posters being replicated on social media platforms in Chickens for Sale #1,2,3 [Call Now 0735 570829] (mixed media, paper, mounted on canvas, 2024). Zimbabwe has one of the highest interest and inflation rates in the world. The primacy and stability of the US dollar is recreated in its fragile and torn states alluding to its high-frequency usage and value in trading in iterations of We Buy Torn Dollar Notes #1,2,3 (mixed media, paper mounted on canvas, 2024).",Gareth Nyandoro: Pfumvudza,"24 Cork Street, W1S 3NG","Tue-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 23 Apr  - 15 Jun 2024

Demonstrating a shift in the artist’s practice towards group portraits and sculpture, Normal Life does not only consider our relationship to our own emotions but explores our connection to society and its changes more broadly.Kim’s lifelong fascination with portraiture stems from his past career in photography, reflecting a motivation to arrest ephemerality. However, the figures in Kim’s paintings remain deliberately obscure. Devoid of idiosyncrasies, these people could be anyone. For Kim, ‘emotionless characters’ mirror the hidden side of modern society, becoming projections of the more difficult thoughts and feelings that we strive to push away. The artist is particularly interested in the singular anxiety that has grown from our rapidly developing technological age.While we simultaneously expose and mask our true selves online, we retreat from the physical world to digital spheres. This sense of isolation is reflected in Kim’s portraits in which figures either appear alone or are presented together with minimal interaction.In many paintings, figures in sombre clothing appear next to sepia counterparts. Perhaps these monochrome people reflect the internal struggle between inward and outward emotion, becoming visualisations of the thoughts and feelings we try to repress. Kim observes that many of us do not show our sadness or anxiety, hiding these negative feelings from wider society. As such, these monochrome figures seem to convey the protective mental shields with which we surround ourselves.The sculptures, new to the artist’s practice, also demonstrate what Kim defines as the ‘veiled story’ that lives inside us all. These sculptures even appear in the paintings themselves. In one image, a figure is about to hurl a sculpted bust across the picture plane, perhaps alluding to an increased resistance to honest emotion.These ideas eventually give way to a more positive outlook. In Kim’s preferred painting of the exhibition, Untitled (Trust), a figure falls through mid-air, seemingly reaching out for support. Another figure, a later addition by the artist, appears at the bottom of the frame with arms outstretched to brace the fall. Kim hints at ideas of companionship, reminding us that we are not always alone. In the end, the artist insists that these works are never based on fully formed thoughts. Rather, Normal Life reflects the vacillations of his experience and the internal monologue that weaves through his mind every day.",Heesoo Kim: Normal Life,"3 Hanover Square, W1S 1HD","Mon-Sat 10am-7pm, Sun 12-6pm", 29 May  - 3 Jul 2024

Softened through the inclusion of fabrics and wallpapers, Olson has created a total environment that is both tactile and womb-like. Viewers seem to inhabit the paintings themselves, as the artist draws us further and further into this enclosed world.Olson has always been drawn to cave environments, viewing them as theatrical landscapes onto which various ideas can be projected. Childhood memories of visits to caverns or play areas built to mimic caves inform his vision of these underground grottos that seem at once organic and simulated. In Grotto Domestic, Olson thinks particularly about time and leisure, pondering what we do when we have too much of both.In this exhibition, the artist conjures a vague image of a post-work or post-scarcity world. These cave-like spaces seemingly offer endless time as, free from societal pressures, creatures simply lounge around or become absorbed by electronic screens. The underground worlds simultaneously evoke a sense of luxury and isolation. Olson plays with a juxtaposition between streamlined modernism and seclusion, forcing viewers to question whether these are spaces of relaxation or traps that inhibit interaction with the outside world.",Jeremy Olson: Grotto Domestic,"3 Hanover Square, W1S 1HD","Mon-Sat 10am-7pm, Sun 12-6pm", 29 May  - 3 Jul 2024

Throughout history, figures as diverse as MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE and INGMAR BERGMAN have sought out their solitude on a voluntarily basis. Perhaps their persistent appeal for privacy triggers our own curiosity and imagination. That is to say, that we are presented with a closed door separating us, on the outside, with them on the inside. What were they up to, really?This pursuit of time alone, with the aim of indulging in laziness, pleasure or intellectual stimulation, is the red thread running through present exhibition. Each work, in its own way, forms a visual expression of this longing to make a ‘French exit’ - or to discreetly retreat from one’s social context.Two private drawings by SERGEI EISENTEIN are joined by one of ARMAND DORÉ’s bohemian femme fatales.

Spreading internationally, it came to represent, above all, an art of juxtaposition and the coalescence of disparate elements with a witty or dreamlike logic. ‘La carmagnole’, a 1927 painting by Max Ernst (1891–1976) depicting an otherworldly scene populated by dancing, distorted figures, illustrates the Surrealists’ belief in metamorphosis and transformation. These fantastical elements are picked up by Lucas Samaras (1936–2024) in his Photofictions, a series of hallucinatory self-portraits and psychedelic compositions that conjure enigmatic scenes, while the amorphous sculptures of Barry Flanagan (1941–2009) blur the boundaries between human and animal, reality and fantasy. The bodily form and texture of Flanagan’s ‘The Voyager’, 1984, eerily echo the figures in Ernst’s painting.Often employing symbols and hidden meanings, the work of the Surrealists articulated profound messages and emotions. Bill Woodrow’s (b.1948) unexpected combinations in ‘Half King, Whole Fish’, 1988 and ‘Clockswarm’, 2001 have the viewer scramble for concealed messages, while the playfully disturbing paintings of John Wesley (1928–2022) combine seemingly unrelated objects to create a sense of irrationality and surprise. An important reference point here is the relationship of image and object considered by René Magritte’s (1898–1867) painting ‘The Treachery of Images’, 1929, often referred to colloquially as ‘Ceci n’est pas une pipe’, today residing in the LACMA collection. Patrick Caulfield’s (1936–2005) great admiration for Magritte is revealed mostly clearly through ‘Night Pipe’, 1992, its titular subject matter a direct reference to Magritte’s masterpiece, and ‘Evening Paper’, 1999, which exemplifies the artists’ shared interest in the eeriness of empty interior spaces.Giorgio de Chirico (1888–1978) also uses spatial dislocation to create mysterious scenes that prompt viewers to scrutinise the boundaries between reality and the imagination. ‘Piazza d’Italia’, 1960, a typically disquieting piazza painting, with classical arches, perspective and angled light, is paired with paintings by Allan D’Arcangelo (1930–1998) and Mimmo Paladino (b.1948). D’Arcangelo’s ‘Landscape with Three Trees’, 1968 defies conventional perspective and lighting, whilst Paladino’s enigmatic sculptures draw on mythology and architectural elements to resonate on a deep psychological level.Jean (Hans) Arp (1886–1966) was interested in exploring the subconscious mind. He employed chance – arranging pre-cut biomorphic forms where they fell – to create ‘automatic collages’. These organic forms are echoed in the sculptures of Paul Feeley (1910–1966) and David Annesley (b.1936), who in the 1960s termed himself a ‘neo-Surrealist’, because for him ‘abstraction’ meant to abstract from the figure. The fluid, curvilinear forms that populate the paintings of Landon Metz (b.1985), made with a free-flowing dye that charts its own path, continue this Surrealist interest in automatism into the 21st century.‘Beyond Surrealism’ affirms the enduring potency of Surrealism to kindle the imagination of the creative mind. While these artists did not term themselves Surrealist and could not be termed as such, this exhibition explores the ways in which the artistic practices they pursued were made in part possible by the Surrealist artists that came before them.",Beyond Surrealism,"11 Cork Street, W1S 3LT","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm", 29 Apr  - 15 Jun 2024

Embodying a poignant sense of transience and reflection, her paintings navigate an ambiguous territory between abstraction and figuration, shifting between the sentimental and melancholic, the uncanny and strange. Lancaster’s recent body of work depicts anonymous women set within pastoral landscapes, as part of her ongoing engagement with archival and discarded ephemera she sources from online auction sites, flea markets and junk shops. While rooted in a longer lineage of artists pushing the psychological boundaries of figurative painting, she is interested in subverting the gendered nature of this art history. Divorced from their specific context and time, Lancaster’s subject matter appears like a dreamlike vision taken from a shared consciousness, where figures reveal themselves to the viewer, both haunting and alluring, creating a sense of connection between the lives of the lost and the nameless - and our own. In this new body of work, Lancaster delves further into the physicality of her materials, refocusing and transforming how paint and image interact with one another. The works explore the interplay of liminal space, and the physical aspect of the paint becoming an entry way for illusion. The result of which is work that is transcient, with figures that ebb and flow as if through a distant memory or a fleeting dream.
