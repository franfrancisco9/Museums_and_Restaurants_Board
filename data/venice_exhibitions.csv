Patricia Low Venezia,Venice,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/xenia-hausner-stranger-things/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Xenia Hausner,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/xenia-hausner/,"Hausner‘s brightly colorful paintings picture individuals in moments of connection and transit. Stranger Things (2023), the painting that lends its title to the exhibition, shows three female characters in what seems to be a night club. However, many details in this picture tend to contradict our initial assumptions and, in a classic Hausner’s manner, leave once more the narrative ambivalent and open to interpretations. What exactly is that place with a curious painted floor? What brings these three characters together in this picture? Are the gestures between the two younger women an expression of their sexual attraction? In fact, the female characters Hausner portrays embody all genders and play various roles – like actors they explore a variety of relationships.Staging is critical in Hausner‘s work, her paintings hint at narratives beyond the frame, while foreclosing the possibility of a complete reading. Bodies are entangled, their relations imbued with a sense of intimacy and urgency in fragments of a story, comparable to film stills whose plot has gone missing, they defy clear interpretation. Narratives of exile and displacement are intimated in different forms – the unusual shaped-canvas used for Double Dip creates a salient focus on the current social disruption and points out this fragmentation – in the literal sense of the word – through the central figure which is headless. Hands reach for other hands, whether seeking help or experiencing rejection. Despite its luminously shimmering colors, the duality of the scene in Deep Water (2024) cannot divert from the drama it depicts through a boat used by migrants who might still be hidden under the beautiful blanket that covers part of its deck. The artist seems to be playing with the old saying “still waters run deep”.Three new sculptures echo the themes and figures in the paintings. In Spill (2024), a professionally attired female figure is slicked with what appears to be crude oil. A bird drenched in the same viscous black liquid perches upon her head, as she holds on to a red and white life-ring. Atemluft (2024), which means “A Breath of Air,” addresses air pollution. In Xenia Hausner’s own words: “Atemluft is a concrete image of desperation, a struggle for what we need the most in order to live. What are we losing? What have we put at risk?”. As in the paintings, these are scenes of outreach, of attempts at salvage in a turbulent world. In their ambiguous echoing of present realities, the works extend a quiet, connecting thread to the lyrical title of this year’s Venice Biennale, Foreigners Everywhere.Xenia Hausner (b. 1951 in Vienna, Austria) studied stage design at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and worked as a set designer for much of her early career. Pivoting to painting in the early 1990s, Hausner has exhibited her work globally ever since, including at The Albertina Museum Vienna; Batliner Art Foundation, Vienna; Museum Franz Gertsch, Burgdorf; Elbphilharmonie, Hamburg; Glasstress, Palazzo Franchetti Venice, collateral to the 57th Venice Biennale 2017; 8th Moscow Biennale; Shanghai Art Museum; Today Art Museum, Beijing; Hong Kong Arts Centre; Russian State Museum, St. Petersburg; Museum Würth France Erstein; Würth Collection Oslo; State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow; Bienalsur – South America’s Art Biennale 2019 – Juntos Aparte, Colombia; This will have been another happy day!, PalaisPopulaire der Sammlung Deutsche Bank Berlin, 2020.",Xenia Hausner: Stranger Things,"Palazzo Contarini Michiel, 2793",Tue-Sat 10am-1pm & 2pm-6pm, 17 Apr  - 9 Jun 2024  
Unit,Venice,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/in-praise-of-black-errantry/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",,,"Curated by Indie A. Choudhury (The Courtauld Institute of Art, London) with assistant curator Kelsey Corbett (Unit), the exhibition brings together 19 modern and contemporary Afro-diasporic artists. As a mode of survival, errantry infers fugitivity as well as improvisation.The poetics of errantry offers a counter-discourse about Black cultural production, raising critical questions: how has errantry been employed aesthetically and politically as a form of Black dissent? How do incidental encounters of the itinerant or the arbitrary inform technical and formal innovations, as well as other artistic freedoms? How do the terms of disobedience and waywardness figure in the art of the Black diaspora?Newly commissioned works by Stacey Gillian Abe, Winston Branch, Jonathan Lyndon Chase, Rachel Jones, Hilda Kortei, Sola Olulode, Anya Paintsil, and Charmaine Watkiss will be on view alongside works by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Romare Bearden, Phoebe Boswell, Adelaide Damoah, Paul Dash, Miranda Forrester, Claudette Johnson, Keith Piper, Hank Willis Thomas, and Joy Yamusangie. The exhibition also presents a site-specific sound installation by Trevor Mathison (Dubmorphology and Black Audio Film Collective).If “Foreigners Everywhere”, the theme of the 2024 Venice Biennale, emphasises a multiplicity of ethnicities, genders, and nationalities, all in service of what the curator Adriano Pederosa calls a “celebration of the foreign, the distant, the outsider, the queer, as well as the indigenous”, In Praise of Black Errantry explores the significance of wandering beyond national borders or the limits of exile in celebration of artists who are, themselves, challenging conventional discourses.On view from 17 April–29 June the exhibition will be in the Palazzo Pisani S. Marina, a 15th-century palace located in the Cannaregio area of Venice and depicted in a Renaissance painting by Jacopo de’ Barbari. The palazzo previously hosted the Diaspora Pavilion in 2017 and the Croatia National Pavilion in 2015. In Praise of Black Errantry will mark Unit’s first presentation during the Venice Biennale, as part of the gallery’s commitment to research-led initiatives that nurture artists and contribute to contemporary cultural discourse beyond conventional programming structures. The exhibition is part of a greater dialogue on Afro-diasporic art which includes current exhibitions Soulscapes, Dulwich Picture Gallery, London; Entangled Pasts: 1768-Now, Royal Academy, London; The Time is Now: Artists Reframe the Black Figure, National Portrait Gallery, London; and Giants: Art from the Dean Collection of Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys, Brooklyn Museum, New York, among others.The accompanying exhibition catalogue includes contributions by the curator Indie A. Choudhury; artist Jonathan Lyndon Chase; award-winning poet Roger Robinson; and Robert G. O’Meally, the Zora Neale Hurston Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University.With special thanks to Company Gallery, DC Moore Gallery, Felix & Spear, Pace Gallery, the Romare Bearden Foundation, Sapar Contemporary, Sheffield Museums, Tiwani Contemporary, Varvara Roza Galleries, and private lenders including Sonia Johnson-Brown and Thaddaeus Ropac.",In Praise of Black Errantry,"Palazzo Pisani S.

Victoria Miro Venice,Venice,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/sarah-sze-8/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Sarah Sze,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/sarah-sze/,"Two immersive environments explore how images are constructed and memories are formed. Sze will take over the gallery with a new moving-image installation and present a suite of new paintings in surroundings that bring the mise-en-scène of Sze’s New York studio to a nearby Venetian apartment, uncannily evoking a sense that the artist has just stepped away from her place of work.Sze’s latest video work transforms the gallery with an array of ever-changing projections suspended throughout the space. Carefully composed, the projections invite the viewer to visually navigate the work, forming a personal narrative by journeying from one image to the next. Interested in shattering the singularity of an image, and in dismantling any hierarchy of visual material, Sze’s installation questions the nature of looking and underscores how images are fundamental to memory.On view in the salon rooms of an apartment opposite the gallery, Sze creates a total environment with a series of paintings presented within a simulation of the space in which they were made. Again considering the perception of images, Sze’s enquiry is one of orientation: how does one locate oneself in a painting, and how can a painting’s effect be one of disorientation? Compositionally complex, the works incorporate both art historical strategies and digital techniques. These are paintings that reward the act of looking: the eye is always engaged in a process of putting the paintings together and taking them apart.A sense of discovery and indulging the pleasure of being lost rather than arriving at a destination has informed all of Sze’s oeuvre, and the experience of Venice as a place, its unique invitation to wander, is echoed within the exhibition. All of the works on view incorporate imagery – even if layered and hidden – that Sze has captured or created in the city.About the artistFor the past thirty years, Sarah Sze has developed a singular visual language that challenges the static nature of art with a dynamic body of work spanning sculpture, painting, drawing, printmaking, video, and installation.Born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1969, Sze lives and works in New York. Sze represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 2013 and was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2003. The artist has exhibited in museums worldwide, and her works are held in the permanent collections of prominent institutions, including Tate, UK; M+ Museum, Hong Kong; MUDAM, Luxembourg; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; the Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Sze has also created public works for the High Line in New York, the city’s Second Avenue Subway Station, and the new LaGuardia Airport.Current and recent solo exhibitions include: Sarah Sze: Timelapse, at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (2023) and a solo exhibition at the Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas, Texas (until 18 August 2024).Sarah Sze: Metronome, a new work co-commissioned and co-produced by Artangel, UK, OGR Torino, Italy, and Aarhus Art Museum, Denmark, opens at ARoS on 18 May and continues until 20 October 2024.",Sarah Sze,"Il Capricorno, San Marco 1994, Calle Drio La Chiesa, 30124",Tue-Sat 10am-1pm & 2pm-6pm, 16 Apr  - 16 Jun 2024
