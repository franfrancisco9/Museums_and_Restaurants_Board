She raises critical questions – where does knowledge lie? Who and what is classified? – joining together the threads of dissociated knowledge systems.The evocative photographs at the core of Digital Clouds Don’t Carry Rain are set amongst the dying trees of Derbyshire, home of the Industrial Revolution. In these self-portraits, the artist mimics poses from 18th-century Casta paintings, a genre of art that was used in Spain to illustrate colonial, racist social hierarchies – classifying mixed race individuals within a ‘caste’ system.Attempting to make complex power structures visible, Alcázar-Duarte intervenes in her photographs. Masks covered in flowers reference both the emblems of empire and plants that are vitally important to endangered bees in the Yucatán. Copper appears throughout the works, a material extracted from Mexico under Spanish colonial rule which today continues to be used in cables as a carrier for the internet globally. Patterning formed by datasets scanned from the faces of the Casta paintings are juxtaposed against the fleur-de-lis: a symbol of the lily connoting monarchy and virtue, which was also used during the colonial era to mark enslaved people as a punishment.These photographs appear alongside a short film U K'ux Kaj / Heart of sky, Mayan god of storms (2023-24), produced at Maní in the Yucatán Peninsula, the town where the Mayan codices were burned in 1562. Rooted in the centre of the exhibition is a new installation T'aabal chukChuuk / Embers (2024). Using an algorithm inspired by the collective intelligence of bee colonies, Alcázar-Duarte merges the fleur-de-lis with fragments from the Casta paintings. The resulting fifty-six 3D printed lilies form a garden of technology based in historical classification systems, activated through augmented reality.The artist reflects: “I find myself wondering if there could be different approaches to tackling the important questions of our time…how is it that the knowledge of my ancestors has been completely disassociated from contemporary knowledge systems?”",Mónica Alcázar-Duarte: Digital Clouds Don't Carry Rain,"Rivington Place, EC2A 3BA","Wed & Fri 11am-6pm, Thu 11am-9pm, Sat 12.30-6pm", 16 Feb  - 1 Jun 2024

Drawing on historical and personal archives, ecology politics and indigenous environmentalism, his work demonstrates how artmaking can be used as a tool for social empowerment and to confront continued, aggressive colonial practices.Once a major producer of palm oil for British colonisers, the Niger Delta is considered the mainstay of the Nigerian economy for its large oil reserves and its rich biodiversity due to the presence of rivers, mangroves, freshwater forests, and marine estuaries. In recent years, the region has been at the centre of environmental and social justice campaigns, challenging the pollution caused by major spills and flares at the hands of oil and gas industry giants.The works in the exhibition are all set in the Niger Delta, Ukpong’s homeland. Driven by a profound desire to effect change, the artist worked with more than two hundred young people from marginalised, oil-producing communities to collectively address the historical and environmental issues in the oil-rich region. The resulting photographs and film powerfully reference local rituals, ceremonial motifs, and symbols interwoven into a complex future cosmology.Ukpong reflects, “Community history, ecology politics, indigenous environmentalism, extractive capitalism, and cultural evolution, these meditations on my homeland demonstrate how the art and filmmaking process can be employed to promote youth empowerment, challenge colonial narratives and disrupt systems of knowledge production.”Through a futuristic lens, Ukpong underscores the need to understand the detrimental impact of this extreme extraction on both people and land.",Wilfred Ukpong: Niger-Delta / Future Cosmos,"Rivington Place, EC2A 3BA","Wed & Fri 11am-6pm, Thu 11am-9pm, Sat 12.30-6pm", 16 Feb  - 1 Jun 2024

Since 1999, Alÿs has recorded children at play in different contexts and environments around the globe. Alongside the first presentation of Children’s Games in the UK, the exhibition debuts a new body of animated films depicting both traditional and lesser-known hand games played by children and adults alike. Francis AlÿsWith a career spanning four decades, Alÿs has forged a unique and radical practice ranging from painting and drawing to film and animation. Trained as an architect and urbanist in Tournai, Belgium and Venice, Italy, Alÿs moved to Mexico City in 1986. The rapidly shifting urban context and the consequent changes to social dynamics in the late 1980s inspired him to become a visual artist, developing his early public interventions. Works like Paradox of Praxis 1 (Sometimes Making Something Leads to Nothing), 1997, wherein Alÿs pushed a large block of melting ice through the streets of Mexico City for nine hours, quickly established him as a leading artist of his generation.Working in collaboration with local communities around the world, his engagement with cross-cultural contexts from Latin America to North Africa and the Middle East operates beyond dominant, Western-centric narratives. What emerges is a lifelong exploration of art as a vehicle for witnessing social and political change.",Francis Alÿs: Ricochets,"Barbican Centre, Silk Street, EC2Y 8DS","Sat-Wed 10am-6pm, Thu-Fri 10am-8pm", 27 Jun  - 1 Sep 2024

In the paintings, seemingly familiar narratives are alluded to but destabilised. The viewer’s own projections are called upon to fulfil the interpretive loop, raising questions about childhood, religion, race, power, and the legacies of empire.These personal stories are told through layers of memory, imagination, and conversations with the history of painting. Drawing on multiple influences including El Greco, Gwen John, Noah Davis, and the Ajanta cave paintings, Krishanu’s work often explores how representations in the canon of Western art have shaped our collective unconscious around questions of race and gender. Working in ongoing series that include Another Country, Mission, and Holy Family, one painting segues into the next as a natural telling of the artist’s own journey through the joys and sorrows of life, with deeply personal subject matter that speaks to the human condition in all its complexity.The exhibition’s title, The Bough Breaks, proceeds from the artist’s recent exhibition On a Limb (Jhaveri Contemporary, Mumbai, 2023). Both exhibitions relate to images from Krishanu’s Two Boys series, in which the artist and his brother are depicted perched on, and to some extent dwarfed by, the majestic branches, or ‘limbs’, of the banyan tree—an iconic symbol in Indian culture. The potential failure of this security—if the bough was to break—alludes to the dark undertones of the nursery rhyme Rock-a-bye Baby, as well as to the evident failure of the structures that should protect, provide for, and perpetuate society: a poignant metaphor for contemporary life.Krishanu’s practice is at once an exploration of subject and medium, where by deeply personal subject matter is a means of approaching his primary, painterly concerns. The compositions provide multiple entry points—at times holding the viewer at bay and, at others, inviting them in. Meaning is implied rather than dictated, barring the path to reductive biographical readings.Just as the paintings offer an immersion in surfaces, this major showcase of primarily new work by the artist will also foreground Krishanu’s drawings and works on paper—what he describes as the generative heartbeat of the exhibition.A new essay by British broadcaster and journalist Bidisha Mamata will be published as the latest edition of Camden Art Centre’s File Note series.",Matthew Krishanu: The Bough Breaks,"Arkwright Road, NW3 6DG","Tue-Sun 11am-6pm, Thur 11am-9pm", 26 Apr  - 23 Jun 2024

Led by an inquisitivenature and discerning eye, he salvages materials then choreographs them in complex structures that sit between figuration and abstraction. Spools that store fibres and threads, and much larger scale equivalents that have an industrial purpose, are a recurring motif in the installation. He masterfully binds, wraps, stitches, sutures, and layers materials with an intuitive, systematic and dynamic approach to colour texture and form, and an innate sense of volume, weight, balance and spatial values.Music is a backdrop for the creation and appreciation of Omoding’s work—often traditional Ugandan folksongs or contemporary African pop music that he plays whilst working in his London studio. The energy and rhythm of the music directly informs the pace of his work, as well as the improvised movements of his fingers and hands. Some objects are scaled to his body to be used performatively, as instruments.In a much-celebrated open studio presentation at Camden Art Centre in 2019, Omoding created a series of makeshift shelters, or tents. Constructed with found fabrics, stitched and suspended like floating patchworks, these textile constructions came from the heart of a family tradition and the love and care of familial bonds. These provisional structures also bore relation to homes created out of necessity, wherever one finds oneself and with whatever protection is at hand—a site of refuge. The trauma of migration, of leaving home and making a new one in a foreign land, is a relevant subject in Omoding’s biography. He immigrated to the UK as a refugee from the Ugandan civil war when he was 12 years old, to re-join his mother who he hadn’t seen since he was nine months old.Omoding’s neurodivergence is reflected in his work in the way in which he processes his experiences, past and present. Amid the complex and at times contradictory nature of everyday life, Omoding looks to material, sound, and movement to communicate, finding embodied expression in the energy and formal qualities of sculpture, welcoming the audience into the experience, and making space for them to conjure their own memories and associations.",Andrew Omoding: Animals to Remember Uganda,"Arkwright Road, NW3 6DG","Tue-Sun 11am-6pm, Thur 11am-9pm", 26 Apr  - 23 Jun 2024

He accumulated images to inform his theatre, from medieval paintings and Chinese theatre to contemporary clothing and industrial production, and also recorded social and political events and their actors – politicians, soldiers, workers and people on the street – in a collage project that played out across notebooks, journals and manuscripts. Brecht’s dramatic works were often constructed in fragments of text, cut out and reorganised as montages on large sheets of paper. Alongside a selection of these, the exhibition will display original manuscripts, made by Brecht while in exile, that document the devastation of the Second World War. With the exception of War Primer, Brecht’s image-text essay about war under capitalism, most of this material remains little-known.Twice a day throughout the exhibition, actors will lead visitors through Raven Row, performing dramatic fragments from four of Brecht’s unfinished plays from the 1920s, showing how montage and snapshot techniques played a crucial part in his conception of playwriting. Audiences will be asked to consider class conflict and poverty in The Breadshop, the excesses of stock trading in Fleischhacker, a man-made apocalypse in The Flood and a tank crew deserting the front line in Fatzer. Sets for these performances will further animate Brecht’s archive, reproducing his writing about the plays as well as research material he gathered to inform them, and revealing the profound role that visual conceptualisation played in his creative and political thinking.brecht: fragments is curated by Phoebe von Held, in collaboration with Tom Kuhn, Alex Sainsbury, and Iliane Thiemann from the Bertolt Brecht Archive at the Akademie der Künste, Berlin.

An artistic polymath, Chicago’s work is defined by a commitment to craft and experimentation, either through her choice of subject matter or the method and materials she employs.Throughout her six-decade career, Chicago has contested the absence and erasure of women in the Western cultural canon, developing a distinctive visual language that gives visibility to their experiences. To this aim, Chicago has produced both individual and collaborative projects that grappled with themes of birth and creation, the social construct of masculinity, her Jewish identity, notions of power and powerlessness, extinction, and expressed her longstanding concern for climate justice.Judy Chicago: Revelations charts the full arc of Chicago’s career with a specific focus on drawing, highlighting rarely seen works. Several immersive, multi-media elements, including an AR app, a video recording booth, and other audio-visual components, set this show apart from previous surveys of Chicago’s work. With never-before-seen sketchbooks, films and slides, video interviews of participants from The Dinner Party (1974–79), audio recordings, and a guided tour of The Dinner Party by Chicago herself, this novel approach to exhibiting Chicago’s work makes the artist’s presence felt throughout the gallery.The exhibition takes its name from an unknown illuminated manuscript Chicago penned in the early 1970s which will be published for the first time in conjunction with the exhibition by Serpentine and Thames & Hudson. Titled Revelations, this visionary work is a radical retelling of human history recovering some of the stories of women that society sought to erase, and one that Chicago never imagined would be published in her lifetime. Audio excerpts from the book can be heard in each of the galleries through an accompanying audio guide, seamlessly creating a link between visual art and written word that has occupied the artist’s practice since the 1970s.",Judy Chicago: Revelations,"West Carriage Drive, W2 2AR",Tue-Sun 10am-6pm, 23 May  - 1 Sep 2024
