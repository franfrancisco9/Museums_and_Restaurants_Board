Unlike these contemporaries, many of whom embraced commercial techniques, Thiebaud described himself as a traditional painter of illusionistic forms. He repeatedly tackled familiar, everyday subjects to challenge and explore the formal possibilities of painting. His meticulously crafted surfaces are steeped with art historical references and a subtle longing for a sweeter time.In Strawberry Cone (1969) the simplicity of the composition highlights Thiebaud’s technical approach to his paintings. Richly painted in pastel shades of pink, the ice cream emerges almost sculpturally against a stark, blank background, its thick layers of paint bulging past the flat plane of the canvas. Dedicated to a tradition of figuration, Thiebaud’s Strawberry Cone demonstrates the artist’s strength in color and masterful use of impasto and brushwork, with the swaths of creamy paint suggesting the ice cream melting in front of the viewer. His painting Jolly Cones (2002) reflects his sustained interest in the role of sweets as a collective experience, imbuing the painting with the same strain of nostalgia that he employed nearly four decades earlier.Though most famous for his persistent rendering of still lifes, portraiture and landscapes were also central to the artist’s practice over the many decades of his career. His portraits reflect a similar modality as his scenes of food– highly stylized, colorful subjects set against distilled backgrounds. Betty Jean (1965) presents the artist’s wife sporting a striped swimsuit in profile, extending her focus past the edge of the frame. Rendering the face with a playful veracity, Thiebaud subverts the image subtly by changing the perspective of the torso to a three-quarters position, flattening the swimsuit’s stripes against the contours of the body. The brightly patterned swimsuit creates a moment of technical interest and abstraction that hints at a body in motion, ready to dip into summer’s waters.This same subversion of perspective also defines the artist’s landscapes, blending points of view to create dreamy realities of the beach bending against water and heat. Tidelines (2004–2014) pushes the artist’s strength in landscapes to its limits, casting his beachgoers into oscillating passages of color. In the foreground, the beachgoers buzz with detail and motion, inducing a feeling of summer ease and nostalgia. As the painting recedes, however, the rendering of the beach distorts and twirls. In lucid hues of yellow, purple, and blue, Thiebaud disrupts the atmospheric perspective with a quickening flatness, rejecting the vanishing point for an absorbing color field thick with movement and animated brushwork. Echoing lapping waves and the long hours of summer days, Tidelines welcomes the viewer into a hypnotizing scene reminiscent of calm, playful vacations in thick heat.Wayne Thiebaud: Summer Days tracks the career of the artist over six decades, revealing his retained interest in lighthearted subjects while casting them in traditional modes of painting. This exhibition celebrates the artist’s regard for the delights of the quintessentially American summer experience, from its sweet ice creams and chilled soda pops to beach games and barbecues, melting a grey winter into a fading memory. In his paintings, an American nostalgia gently invites the viewer into the season’s space, readying them for warmer days ahead.The exhibition will be accompanied by an illustrated catalogue with essays by curator and art historian Steven Nash and art historian Mary Okin.",Wayne Thiebaud: Summer Days,"18 East 79th Street, NY 10075","Mon-Fri 10am-5pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 26 Apr  - 14 Jun 2024

As this movement gained traction, pioneering artists featured in this exhibition drew attention with their paintings full of energetic flashes of color and their physically active means of placing paint to canvas. Artists such as Elaine de Kooning and Helen Frankenthaler, for example, were instrumental to the technical and stylistic developments in this art movement, but were frequently underrepresented in comparison to their male counterparts – and excluded from gallery spaces. Gesture & Form: Women in Abstraction encourages viewers to reconsider the legacy of these women and situates their innovations alongside generations of artists working across the globe.The show highlights the multiplicity that can be found within abstract painting, demonstrating how artists have explored different methods to push the capabilities of the paint medium. With works by Helen Frankenthaler, Vivian Springford, Emily Mason, and Heather Day, viewers will be able to see how the artists activated their bodies to flood canvases with pigment, staining the surfaces with thin layers that swirl over and around each other. These bold washes of color leave traces of their process, and there is a similar effect in the expressive, more gestural works of Elaine de Kooning, Leelee Kimmel, and Jenny Brosinski, which practically vibrate with movement. Each of these paintings embodies the vigorous motion and spirit of artists at work.Further investigations of form can be seen in paintings by Mary Ramsden, Gwen O’Neil, Sarah Crowner, and Selma Parlour. Ramsden and O’Neil’s works demonstrate their considered technique, where dappled strokes introduce textural elements. In contrast to the lyrical forms in O’Neil’s work, Sarah Crowner’s and Selma Parlour’s paintings present geometric compositions that sharply contrast shapes and hues, drawing the viewer’s eye around the image.Beyond exploring material, color and method, this group of artists has also taken inspiration from the world around them. Sasha Ferré and Jemima Murphy reference nature and organic forms in their work, while Minjung Kim and Tia- Thuy Nguyen draw on aspects of their personal identity to incorporate traditional art forms from their respective cultures. Thu-Van Tran’s work is also informed by her heritage, and like Sylvie Fleury and Sylvia Ong, her practice intersects with other visual media and artistic forms to plumb wider societal issues.Now, at a time when figurative art is the trend, Gesture & Form: Women in Abstraction highlights artists who are, at once, continuing to challenge norms while forging careers within a rich and vibrant tradition.— Ferren Gipson, art historian, writer, and textile artist",Gesture & Form: Women in Abstraction,"39 East 78th Street, 2nd Floor, NY 10075",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 3 May  - 15 Jun 2024

She attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and at the Barnes Foundation. In the early 1950’s she moved to New York City where she became friends with many important artists of her generation, such as Al Held, Ronald Bladen, and Willem de Kooning. Before moving to Paris, she had a drink with de Kooning at the legendary Cedar Tavern. He asked her to have dinner with him after her return to New York City, but it never happened. She remained in Paris for almost 40 years, where she met, socialized, and exhibited with artists such as Seymour Boardman, Sam Francis, Shirley Jaffe, and Joan Mitchell. She also knew many recognized European artists such as Alberto Giacometti, Yves Klein, and Sonia Delaunay. Delaunay, who believed in Amaranth’s talent, and strength as a colorist, supported her during her early years in Paris by allowing Amaranth to purchase art supplies on Delaunay’s account. She aided her and her family in many other ways, she was truly Amaranth’s patron.Amaranth perfectly mastered many mediums, creating paintings, drawings, watercolors, sculptures, mosaics, prints, tapestries, scarves, poetry, and writing. She used bold, dynamic brush strokes and strong, vibrant colors as did Delaunay. She named her works by unique, unusual titles, often referring to specific memories, and reflecting the rich, emotionally loaded, dynamic nature of her work.She was breathing and living for art and worked tirelessly. She was a true multimedia artist who worked and created until her final days. Her work has been exhibited around the world and has become part of various important art collections, such as the Women Artists collection at the Mougins Museum in France. As a woman artist belonging to the important school of abstraction, her work is an inseparable part of twentieth-century visual arts.GALLERY 2Ernest Briggs (1923-1984):Ernest Briggs was born in San Diego, California, in 1923. His work from the 1950s can be characterized by loose abstractions and strong, rhythmic brushstrokes. Some of his works cue Still’s influence but he soon moved away from California Abstract Expressionism. Until his death, Briggs moved through various abstract idioms, sometimes returning, and referencing the earlier work. In the 1960s he freely switched between acrylic and oil, creating large canvases characterized by dark, deep colors or lighter strokes, sometimes with unfinished spaces or on unprimed canvas. A few years before his death Briggs simplified his form while still maintaining his wide color palette.He brought out the essence of form with maximal intensity in his works. Briggs passed away in New York in 1984 at the age of 61 from cancer. His works are in the collections of The Anita Shapolsky Art Gallery, The Whitney Museum of American Art, The San Francisco Museum of Art, The Carnegie Institute, The Smithsonian American Art Museum, and other institutions.Seymour Boardman (1921-2005):Seymour Boardman, artistically formed in New York and Paris, before and after WWII, developed and defined his style alongside fellow influential artists like Sam Francis, Larry Calcagno, John Hultberg, and Frank Lobdell. Exhibiting in solo and group shows from the 1950s until his death in 2005, Boardman's paintings can be found in national and international collections.Boardman's paintings can be recognized by an apparent underlying grid that sets the stage for an orchestration of linear motifs that became more and more simplified over the years. Anita Shapolsky highlights the intellectual European starting point of his work that matured and evolved into an almost jazz-like improvisational musical score of the line moving across the canvas.His works are in the collections of many major museums and institutions, such as the Whitney Museum, the Guggenheim, Brooklyn Museum, Santa Barbara Museum of Art and others.Peter Bonner (1964-):Peter Bonner is an Australian Artist, who in 1996 won the Dobell Prize, the highest prize for Drawing in Australia. In his early 20’s he traveled in India, the Middle East, and throughout Europe, and studied drawing and painting in London, Melbourne, and New York. In 2010 he completed a master’s by Research at Monash University pursuing his interest in Perception, Narrative, and the Primitive. He has been influenced greatly by Australian Aboriginal artists, Russian Icons, and the deserts of Central Australia and the American West. Bonner currently lives and works in NYC.Charles Clough (1951-):In 1951, Charles Clough was born in Buffalo, New York. In 1971, he opened an art studio. His paintings are extravagantly colorful and explosively formless.“In the “Clufffalo” paintings is a technique that I began using – my ‘big finger-painting tools’, which has evolved into one I call ‘pour & blots’, which literally describes the technique. I find that by not using brushes I can achieve a novelty of appearance that transcends apex. The joy in making these paintings lies in seeing images and effects that only exist through my particular process. I seek to embody the creative imagination such that it can be thought of as a pseudo-organism from an imaginary universe. I seek atmospheres like Redon’s or Bonnard’s, with pareidolia as in Gorky and Tanguy…I believe I’m inventing a new vocabulary of color/shape”.More than 600 of his artworks are in permanent collections of over 70 museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The National Gallery of Art, and the Smithsonian.Richards Ruben (1925-1998):Ruben painted in a sculptural way. He drew with his stretcher bars, covering them and shaping the canvas to reflect his interest in how the inner rhythms of the image correspond with the outer image of the canvas as well as the canvas's interaction with the wall.His work is in the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, University of Southern California, Pomona College, and University Art Museum, University of California. Over 40 of his paper paintings were accepted into the Menil Collection in 2022.Thomas Sills (1914-2000):Thomas Sills married the mosaicist, Jeanne Reynal. Inspired by her collection of abstract art, he began working with materials that his wife used in her mosaics but soon branched out to oil on wood as well as canvas.Thomas Sills spent most of his creative life in New York City, deeply rooted in the artistic trends as well as cultural issues from the early 1950s to 1970s. Even though he lacked formal training, his self-taught artistic skills released phantasmic abstract paintings. His regular presence in the art world of the 1950s through the early 1970s as an African American painter situated him as an integral element of mainstream and African American art. Thomas Sills, himself however, perceived his art beyond the political; he remained loyal to his commitment to art as a form of expression of the dynamism that escapes any formal constraints.Michael Loew (1907-1985):For more than 30 years, Michael Loew spent his summers in the Monhegan arts community in Maine where he developed from nature to abstraction. While he often used a grid-like, geometrically inspired arrangement, landscapes primarily inspired his work, and his approach was more painterly and expressive. His energetic application of color captured the harmonic luminous effect of light and space. He stated that a painted surface must retain the transparency of a jewel. His work is in numerous museums nationally and internationally, including the Whitney, the Guggenheim, the Hirshorn, and Albright-Knox.Buffie Johnson (1912-2006):Buffie Johnson, born in New York City, studied art in Paris and at the Art Students League. Her earliest works tended toward the Surrealist; then came more abstract canvases of intense color and pure form. In later years, she turned to huge realistic paintings of flowers and other plant forms, which were imbued with texture through their profuse, veiny detail. She is recognized for her exploration of the subconscious and the mystical in her art. Her paintings frequently portrayed dreamlike landscapes and fantastical figures, reflecting her fascination with psychology and the esoteric. She wrote “Lady of the Beast: Ancient Images of the Goddess and Her Sacred Animals” published by Harper & Row in 1988. In the late 1950’s, Johnson was commissioned to paint a huge abstract mural for the Astor Theater on New York’s Broadway, which was well publicized. Johnson consistently aimed to portray divine female power. Her work is in the collections of major museums, including the Guggenheim, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.Jon Schueler (1916-1992):At the CSFA, Clyfford Still introduced Schueler to the work of J.M.W. Turner whose use of light and color to capture the fleeting effects of the sky deeply influenced him. Similar to Turner, Schueler’s skyscapes would blur the line between abstraction and representation using depth and luminosity to capture an emotive record, visualizing his experiences, including those of World War II. After living in NYC, Schueler relocated to Scotland where the ever-changing skies were a source of inspiration as he pursued creating “a painting most like nature”.Schueler saw his work as a means of conveying the emotional and spiritual dimensions of the natural world. Subsequently, he would favor minimal shapes, almost eliminating figuration, allowing for a viewer's personal associations to shape their experience. These “Skyscapes” are the defining aspect of his oeuvre; an exploration of color and emotion, an evocation of nature.Carol Barsha (1952-):Carol Barsha beautifully encapsulates a dreamscape of nature and the world around her. She draws inspiration for her symbolic, sometimes surreal paintings from both imagined and natural phenomena. She aims to explore and capture the beauties of simple and complex structures of the visual world and recreate them. She has been practicing this method since the 1970s and learned from her mentor Phillip Guston.Louise Nevelson (1899-1988):Louise Nevelson was an American sculptor who emigrated with her family to the states from Russia. Using old pieces of wood and found objects, she constructed huge walls and enclosed box arrangements of complex and rhythmic abstract shapes. Examples of Nevelson’s work is in 50 museums including the Whitney and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.James Brooks (1906-1992):James Brooks was an influential American abstract expressionist painter known for his dynamic and gestural style. He initially trained as a commercial artist before transitioning to fine art. His work often featured sweeping brushstrokes and vibrant colors, reflecting his exploration of emotional depth and spontaneity within abstract forms. Brooks' contributions to the abstract expressionist movement earned him recognition as a leading figure in post-war American art.",Living In The Moment Of Abstract Art,"152 East 65th Street, NY 10065",Tue-Fri 11am-6pm, 16 May  - 7 Sep 2024

Although she left for the United States in 1955, she eventually divided her time between Paris and California. Untitled (2014) is characteristic of Adnan’s abstract landscapes created using a palette knife. These works suggest the shape of Mount Tamalpais near Adnan’s home in California – an object of fixation that she compared to Paul Cézanne’s relationship with Mont Sainte-Victoire.The interwar Paris that Alexander Calder encountered in 1926 was the epicenter of the avant-garde. It was in Paris that Calder developed his signature ""mobiles’ in 1931 and his first ‘stabiles’ the following year. When he returned to the United States in 1933, his artistic identity was formed. Untitled (1940) is a dramatic example of Calder’s stabiles that recalls the suggestive formal vocabulary of his friend Joan Míro while exemplifying the equilibrium and playful biomorphism that characterizes Calder’s mature work.With proceeds from the G.I. Bill, Ed Clark arrived in Paris in 1952 and remained for four years, becoming central to a group of abstract painters and African American intellectuals. During this period Clark began what he called ‘the big sweep’: his signature technique of using a push-broom to apply paint. In Untitled (1984) he reinterprets the oval forms that had been central to his pioneering series of shaped canvases in a work that epitomizes his unique approach to color.After first visiting Paris in 1948, Joan Mitchell returned frequently before finally relocating permanently to France in 1959. In Untitled (1983) a rectangular field of blended blue pigment covers the page, revealing only hints of pink and yellow and black gestures. Mitchell here approaches pastel – a medium often associated with delicate sketches – as a tool for gestural bravura. At the same time, her palette and her use of pastel recall the French Impressionist landscapes which influenced her visual approach after her move to France.Ad Reinhardt was an avid traveler throughout the 1950s and 1960s, keeping extensive journals detailing art and architecture. His relationship with Paris was solidified by his 1960s solo show Mysticisme athée at Galerie Iris Clert. Painted several years earlier, Reinhardt’s Number 11 (Flowers) (1949) is an outstanding example of his early exploration of calligraphic gesture and romanticism.Additional artists will include: Louise Bourgeois, John Chamberlain, Beauford Delaney, Ellsworth Kelly, I.

David Nolan Gallery,New York Upper East Side,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/enrico-baj-alter-ego-and-other-hypotheses/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Enrico Baj,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/enrico-baj/,"With a passion for the eccentric and a strong iconoclastic impulse, Enrico Baj (1924-2003) was one of the central figures of the Italian neo-avant-garde. His art and writings played an instrumental role in influential movements, from Dada and Surrealism to Art Informel and CoBrA, as well as the Nuclear Art movement, which he cofounded in Milan in 1951. Heir to the Surrealist-Dadaist spirit, and an experimenter in original techniques and styles, he departed from gestural abstraction in the mid-1950s and honed an idiosyncratic iconography for his paintings, drawings, collages, objects, and sculptures, defiantly embracing figuration and kitsch symbols, and subverting conventions.Titled after Alterego e altre ipotesi, a publication which Enrico Baj designed in collaboration with Italian poet and art critic Roberto Sanesi in 1970, this exhibition features Baj's work in dialogue with artists who influenced his oeuvre, and with artists from younger generations with whom we’d like to imagine him in conversation today.Baj’s oeuvre bears a distinctly political slant, most glaringly in his Generals and Ladies series. The Generals are pseudo-portraits of military generals, formulated from the details of a military uniform; the Ladies, their wives, composed of the debris of a household and its upkeep. Baj mocks the grandiose self-image of the military general, as well as the outrageous performance required of aristocratic society. His unique form of artistic rebellion stands out from that of his contemporaries; it is perhaps most comparable to the anti-establishment attitude and style of Jean Dubuffet.It’s intriguing to note the connections between Baj and his contemporaries. Active in the Milan art scene, Baj engaged and showed alongside artists like Francis Picabia, Marcel Duchamp, and Lucio Fontana. For example, Baj owned at least three of Picabia’s works, one directly acquired from the artist himself.His encounter with Asger Jorn in 1953 led to the establishment of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus opposing the rationalization of art. Collaborating not only ideologically but also artistically, Baj and Jorn worked together on Jorn’s well-known Modifications series. Modifications revised found kitsch paintings, emphasizing the critique inherent in appropriating low-brow artwork.Before meeting Marcel Duchamp, Baj belonged to a generation of artists revisiting the Dadaist’s work upon the publication of Duchamp’s writings and monograph in the late 1950s. Baj exhibited in the 1960 International Surrealist Exhibition, which Duchamp co-curated with André Breton, proving the awareness was mutual.Duchamp and Baj finally met on Baj’s trip to New York in 1961 for the MoMA exhibition The Art of Assemblage. Baj and Duchamp, both participating in the landmark show, struck up a close friendship that would lead to support of each other’s careers and, eventually, artistic collaboration on a 1965 version of Duchamp’s L.H.O.O.Q. Their friendship, along with their shared sense of humor and embrace of the banal, established a living connection between Duchamp’s Dada and Baj’s Neo-Dada.What united these artists - Duchamp, Picabia, Jorn, Baj - was the humor and double entendre present in their works, rooted in the observation of real-life while overlapping with several different Modern/Post-War movements.André Breton was also friends with Baj; Breton consistently invited Baj to exhibit with the Surrealist Movement. Breton, a prolific writer and poet, penned a lengthy essay about Baj, which was published in the third edition of Breton’s book Le Surréalisme et la Peinture. Baj’s relationship with Breton and acceptance into Surrealist institutions validates his enormous range as an artist and his category-defying legacy. Baj maintained close ties with the pioneers of Dada and Surrealism, co-founding the Pataphysic Institute of Milan in 1963, an Italian equivalent of the Parisian College de Pataphysique de France, with Man Ray and others.In addition, Breton and Max Ernst avidly collected Native American art, and frequently showed katsina dolls alongside their own works in several notable exhibitions. It is possible, even likely, that Baj encountered these dolls at their homes. Katsina dolls, known as tithu to the Hopi, are visual representations of the katsinam, the essential life force of all animate beings. The dolls unite the creative and the utilitarian, serving as a method of spiritual relief from the demands of modern life. Baj related to his art in a similar manner, channeling the raw elements of his lived experience into his work.Lucio Fontana, another friend of Baj, coproduced the work Attese (Waitings) with the artist in 1959. Fontana and Baj exhibited together frequently, often in Milan; the association between the two continues until today, with a 2020 exhibition at Mazzoleni in Turin grouping Fontana, Baj, and Piero Manzoni. The trio were close; for example, the three artists collaborated on Baj’s periodical, Il Gesto, in 1955.William Copley and Baj mesh stylistically in their collage-like aesthetic and adoption of bright color. In 1959, the two created at least two artworks together, Personaggi e segnali and Gli amanti. This sort of artistic communion typifies the exchange occurring within the network of artists surrounding both Baj and Copley, another example of which presents itself in the artistic interpretations Baj made of his fellow artists in works like Bonjour Max Ernst (1975) and Ritratto di Lucio Fontana.Baj also influenced younger artists such as Martin Kippenberger, Mike Kelley, and Jonathan Meese. Ever since his participation in the Venice Biennale in 1964, Baj’s artwork has been exhibited in all the major European museums and frequently in the United States since 1960.With additional works by:Richard ArtschwagerKerstin BrätschWilliam CopleyMarcel DuchampNicole EisenmanAsger JornMartin KippenbergerJonathan MeeseFrancis PicabiaMan Rayand 20th-Century Indigenous Artists",Enrico Baj: Alter Ego and Other Hypotheses,"24 East 81st Street, NY 10028",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 18 Apr  - 31 May 2024

While this early pairing explored their mutual penchant for versatile experimentation related to temporal and spatial relationships, Enchanted Reverie seeks instead to emphasize their respective investigations and interests in natural forms and kinetic energies. The works of Klee and Calder are placed in conversation once more, in an exhibition designed as a dreamlike realm where rare masterpieces by each artist are meaningfully presented to illustrate their explorations of the spiritual and unknown.In a 1962 interview, Calder was asked, “What artists do you most admire?” He replied, “Goya, Miró, Matisse, Bosch and Klee.”[1] These artists shared a commonality — namely the ability to conceptualize existence without heavy, dramatic overtones, but rather with a rhythmic lightness and vibrancy. Calder likely viewed Klee as a Modern master of this feat, whose lyrical investigations of space and form were inspirational.A prolific creator, Klee’s works are cornerstones of nearly every major institutional collection. He continually demonstrated a masterful command of line and color, revealing the intricate connections that both capture and bind us to the concrete and metaphysical realms. For Klee, natural phenomena served as a metaphor for both artistic and cosmic creation. In his Creative Credo V (1920), Klee furthers this notion, stating, “formerly we used to represent things which were visible on earth… we reveal the reality that is behind visible things, thus expressing the belief that the visible world is merely an isolated case in relation to the universe and that there are many more other, latent realities.”[2]Though part of the subsequent generation, Calder's nonobjective sculptures exploit atmospheric effects to engage time and space within and beyond the human realm. His diverse body of work, celebrated in public collections and commissions throughout the world, transports viewers into the fourth dimension, evoking notions of immateriality and the sublime. In a 1946 catalogue essay, Jean-Paul Sartre wrote: “Although Calder has not sought to imitate anything ... his mobiles are at once lyrical inventions, technical, almost mathematical combinations and the tangible symbol of Nature, of that great, vague Nature that squanders pollen and suddenly causes a thousand butterflies to take wing.”The exhibition includes loans from distinguished private collections and international institutions including the Fondation Beyeler, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago, as well as an impressive selection of works from the Calder Foundation. Enchanted Reverie: Klee and Calder will be accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue featuring a selected chronology and major essays written by the historian Olivier Berggruen and Dr. Elizabeth Hutton Turner, renowned specialists in the emergence and development of Modern and Post-War art.[1] Katharine Kuh, “Alexander Calder” in The Artist’s Voice: Talks with Seventeen Artists (New York: Harper & Row, 1962), 39.[2] Paul Klee, “Creative Credo V” in Tribune der Kunst und Zeit (Berlin: Erich Reiss Verlag, 1920).",Enchanted Reverie: Klee and Calder,"744 Madison Avenue, NY 10065","Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 11am-6pm by timed reservation", 19 Apr  - 8 Jun 2024  
Fleiss,New York Upper East Side,https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/robert-cottinghams-americana/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Robert Cottingham,https://www.galleriesnow.net/artist/robert-cottingham/,"Robert Cottingham was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1935, and currently lives and works in Connecticut. Cottingham is considered part of the first generation of Photorealists along with Chuck Close, Richard Estes and John DeAndrea.When Cottingham was twelve years old in 1947, he visited New York City with his father, experiencing the grand vibrations of destinations like Times Square for the first time. He had a similar revelation when seeing Edward Hopper at the Whitney Museum of American Art through his television that same year. Encounters such as these would be hugely decisive for him later in life. Fascinated by the typography that decorated the visual landscape of the United States, Cottingham began a career as an art director for the New York advertising agency Young and Rubicam. He was eventually relocated to Los Angeles, where the kitschy relics of bygone eras and a radical atmosphere ignited a spark within him and encouraged him to paint every day after work. This is when Cottingham began taking his art seriously, creating one of his very first paintings, Bus II, in 1965, which is included in this exhibition after previously being shown at our booth at TEFAF New York, 2024. In 1968, Cottingham left advertising behind, devoting all his time to his art.The term Photorealism refers to the great value of photography within an artist’s technique, something that Cottingham’s practice majorly revolves around. By translating a photograph into a black and white study, Cottingham captivates realistic shadows and details in his images. After this step, a subsequent colored study is brought to life. His method then involves projecting these gridded studies onto a canvas, utilizing them as guides that allow for the achievement of Photorealism. Cottingham has often rejected this label, however, as he does not view his works as mere reproductions of reality, but more so reinterpretations, sometimes even going as far as consciously altering words in his facades, thus reimagining their meanings. The iconography of Cottingham’s works irrefutably captivates the American vernacular through recognizable motifs and nostalgic commercial landscapes.This exhibition will be accompanied by an illustrated publication.Robert Cottingham (Brooklyn, New York, b. 1935) has been represented by Galerie Georges-Philippe & Nathalie Vallois since 2019.

This series was first exhibited in the 1959 solo show Celebration of the Ground at the distinctive Galerie Daniel Cordier in Paris. Years later, in 1978, these works, some of which are featured in our exhibition, were included in The Early Years 1943 to 1959: An Exhibition of Paintings by Jean Dubuffet at Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York City.Dubuffet’s Materiologies and Texturologies series’ showcase the seemingly endless textures, shapes, and colors of the ground and earth’s soil from a bird's-eye perspective, showcasing the artist’s interest in exploring unorthodox materials and subjects, and approaching art from an authentic, humanistic angle while rejecting traditional notions of academic art.In the preface within the catalogue of the 1959 solo exhibition at Galerie Daniel Cordier, Dubuffet wrote:Observe that my predilection does not go to picturesque, luxuriously grooved or historic soils, as there are, those which are exceptional and to which for this reason attention is focused; oh not at all! I don't have a taste for exceptional things; In all areas it is the most common and the most banal that suits me best. Never anything exceptional in my work. Anything exceptional is strictly banned from my registry! It’s banality that I crave. The road most devoid of any accident or any particularity, any dirty floor or dusty bare earth, to which no one would have the idea of looking - deliberately at least - (even less painting them) - are for me layers of intoxication and jubilation.Jean Dubuffet’s works create a dialogue with Allan McCollum’s Perpetual Photo series, which began in 1972 when the artist started photographing television screens any time a framed picture appeared in the background. After McCollum began isolating, enlarging, and framing the photographs, the finished products turned into entirely new images whose subjects became undefinable. McCollum completed these works by adhering photos of the original tv screens to the backs of their counterparts, a defining allusion to the image’s context. McCollum’s inspiration to create the Perpetual Photo series is rooted in exposing humankind’s incessant need to discern any image that appears in front of them, and embraces his skill in institutional critique through creating artworks that analyze mass production and media.The dichotomy between the object and the image of the object is embedded in both Dubuffet and McCollum’s practices and beliefs. Both artists place great significance on the contradictions between mass produced objects and art, and despite their entirely different methods and time periods, Jean Dubuffet and Allan McCollum blur the boundaries between industrial, artisanal, and artistic production, offering viewers a new perception of art.This exhibition will be accompanied by an illustrated publication, with an essay on Jean Dubuffet and Allan McCollum by curator and former Director of Musée national d’art moderne-Centre Pompidou, Bernard Blistène.Jean Dubuffet (Le Havre, France, 1901-1985) is considered to be one of the most pivotal painters and sculptors from the Post-War period. As a firm advocate of outsider art, his own approach was highly experimental, rejecting traditional notions of artistic creation. Dubuffet’s work has been featured in major exhibitions at institutions including the Museum of Modern Art and Art Institute of Chicago (1962); Tate Gallery and Stedelijk Museum (1966); and Guggenheim Museum (1966–67). His works can be found in public collections such as the Centre Pompidou, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, among others. Dubuffet’s sculptures are installed in public spaces around the world, including Paris, New York, and Chicago.Allan McCollum (Los Angeles, California, b. 1944) is an American artist based in New York City. With a focus on mass consumption, his work has explored the layers of meaning within this phenomenon. McCollum has had major solo exhibitions at the Denver Art Museum (1990); Musée d'art moderne de Lille Métropole, France (1998); and Musée d'art moderne et contemporain, Geneva (2006) and his work was included in Aperto at the 1988 Venice Biennale and in the São Paulo Biennial (2008).

The medium underpins the evolution of the artist’s paintings and is a key component of his books. Punctum offers new perspectives on his exploration of materials and processes, and on the symbolic and expressive potentials of photography.The exhibition’s title refers to a concept formulated by Roland Barthes in his critical text Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography (1980). Punctum (Latin for “puncture” or “wound”) connotes a detail of a photograph that elicits a feeling or personal impact outside those formed principally by its culturally coded subjects. As if picturing a memory of something that never happened, Kiefer’s photographs convey a comprehensive, evocative, even melancholic aura beyond conventional representations of time and place.Returning to perennial motifs and images, the photographs reinforce the continuity of themes such as ruin and destruction, and growth and renewal, across Kiefer’s oeuvre, with subjects ranging from sunflowers and snow-covered fields to dense cityscapes of São Paulo. Works titled Merkaba (2010–13 and 2010–15) and Jericho (2010–15) picture the tower sculptures at La Ribaute, his former studio complex in Barjac, France—now part of his foundation, Eschaton.Kiefer often manipulates his photographs through techniques such as solarization and the application of metals and other materials that transform them physically and metaphorically. In Osiris (1985–91), the addition of heavy, opaque lead to the photograph’s top half creates a juxtaposition between its material properties and its ethereal image, functioning as an effective metaphor for alchemy. Likewise, by applying silver toner to the printed surfaces of works such as Feldblumen (Wildflowers) and Ukraine (both 1994–2012), he blurs distinctions between the photographic and painted image.Titled with a quotation from Immanuel Kant, Der gestirnte Himmel über uns und das moralische Gesetz in uns (The moral law within us, the starry heavens above us) (1969–2009) revisits an image from Kiefer’s Besetzungen (Occupations) series, a parodic travelogue in which the artist poses with a sieg heil salute at culturally charged European locations, appropriating and recontextualizing the taboo gesture to confront the historical weight of the Second World War. In the newer work, Kiefer overpaints the photograph’s top half in gouache, adding a star-filled sky that resonates with Kant’s line.Hero und Leander (2012) is a vitrine sculpture that expresses Kiefer’s relationship with photography. It incorporates a metal bathtub of the sort he used to develop his first photographs and included in early performances, with coiled strips of photographic prints mounted on lead that unfurl from within the vessel. Its title alludes to the Greek legend of Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite who tends a lighthouse on one side of the Hellespont between Europe and Asia, and her lover, Leander, who drowns while swimming across the strait when the guiding light of Hero’s flame is extinguished.Punctum follows La photographie au commencement (Photography at the Beginning), the first retrospective to focus on Kiefer’s relationship with photography, which was organized by the Lille Métropole Musée d’art moderne, d’art contemporain et d’art brut (LaM) in Villeneuve-d’Ascq, France (2023–24). Angeli caduti (Fallen Angels) is on view at Fondazione Palazzo Strozzi, Florence, Italy, through July 21, 2024.",Anselm Kiefer: Punctum,"976 Madison Avenue, NY 10075",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 25 Apr  - 3 Jul 2024

Each of his canvases is structured as a loose grid of rectilinear blocks in three or four rows. Laying down one vivid color at a time, the artist establishes relationships between each area, its neighbors, and the composition as a whole, employing gestural brushwork to juxtapose hues applied with varied degrees of opacity. Between each row are linear bands that ground the composition and sometimes extend the tones of individual blocks. Inspired by jazz, Whitney defines a space within which to improvise, each painting setting a unique group of chromatic and spatial harmonies in motion.Peaches (2023) is dominated by the warm pinks and oranges suggested by its title, which stand in contrast to the cooler blues, blacks, and greens with which they are paired. Spanning ten feet in width, As Wild as the World 2 (2023) reveals the visual impact of scale in conjunction with Whitney’s iterative technique. High Hopes (2024) is a study in contrasts, with complementary pairs of red/green and orange/blue pressing against one another. The loose brushstrokes and more muted tones at the top and bottom of A Tribute to Billie (2024) establish a sonorous composition that evokes the expressive power and vulnerability of its namesake, Billie Holiday.With an unwavering commitment to abstraction, Whitney uses titles that resonate with his inspirations: art and architecture, poetry and music, contemporary issues and observations. On the title of this exhibition, he notes: “I first read this line in a poem in Rome in 1994 and used it as the title of a painting that year. The line stayed with me, and I ended up using it for the title of another painting in 2004. Now, thirty years later, those words seem to resonate with the time we’re living in more than ever.”By the Love of Those Unloved coincides with How High the Moon at the Buffalo AKG Art Museum, the first retrospective to trace the evolution of Whitney’s abstractions over forty-five years. On view in Buffalo, New York, through May 26, 2024, the exhibition will travel to the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (2024–25), and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2025).

Duong’s mother had, herself, trained as an artist, but gave up painting when her children were born. Duong studied ballet in Paris until age twenty-three, training with the Nora Kiss Academy of Classical Dance and Tessa Beaumont, complementing her ballet studies with an erudition in architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. American architect-turned-photographer David Seidner launched Duong into the fashion world when he executed a set of photographs of Duong in 1985. This prompted Duong’s modeling career, working with Christian Lacroix and Isaac Mizrahi, and a coeval career in Hollywood, where Duong acted as a glamorous gangster’s moll in The Mambo Kings (1992), an immigrant tailoress in Scent of a Woman (1992), and a Louise Brooks character in thirty (1993). By 1988, Duong had left Paris and relocated to New York where she met and moved in with Julian Schnabel, who regularly painted Duong’s slender, Modigliani-like visage and encouraged her painting practice. Three years later, Sperone Westwater Gallery showed Duong’s first painting show in New York; Duong’s inaugural self-portrait, Summer in Montauk (1988), was included in a 1997 show at the PMMK Museum of Modern Art in Ostend, Belgium. Soon, in 1999, the Galerie Jerome de Noirmont in Paris exhibited Duong’s first solo show of self-portraits. Notably, in 2006, she was commissioned by Barry Diller to execute a nine-foot stainless steel sculpture of Diane von Fürstenberg. Since then, Duong has had numerous one-woman shows of her work at venerable institutions, including Sonnabend Gallery (New York, 2011), Robilant + Voena (London, 2014), and Galerie Gmurzynska, where she has been regularly exhibiting since 2021.Duong’s work belongs to public collections including the National Portrait Gallery (Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D.C.) and the Statue of Liberty Museum, New York, which commissioned Duong’s 50 sculpted stars for the new museum entrance in 2019. Duong’s work also belongs to illustrious private collections, including filmmakers, artists, architects and designers ranging from Dennis Hopper to Bruno Bischofberger, Spyros Niarchos, Simon de Pury, Patrick Painter, and Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana. Duong has gained widespread acclaim for her singular portraits, painting the likeness of Vincent Gallo, Susan Sarandon, Anjelica Huston, Karen Elson, Christian Louboutin. A number of these portraits are on display in Galerie Gmurzynska’s new show, which spans the breadth of Duong’s portraiture.There is a characteristic fleshiness to Duong's portraits—a crisp fleshiness, distinct from the Neo- Expressionist thickets of Jenny Saville’s brushwork and the flat roseate nudes of Maureen Dougherty’s sprightly fêtes galantes. Duong’s paintings are executed in veristic style and uncompromisingly theatrical in substance; they are tethered to an elliptical world striped with narratives that we only catch glimpses at. There is a cinematic quality to Duong’s use of light and her composition, her splinter-scenes rife with narratives attested to by her titles (e.g., Apres la Dispute (After the fight), 2006; The Gentlewoman or the Aggravation of our Incoherences, 2022; Between Epicureanism and Stoicism, 2022). More often than not, Duong’s subjects are women. Though they might flaunt the vaudeville garb of an 18th century empresses donned in russet-curled wigs and half-sheeted in knight’s armor, as in The Impossible Gender Frontiers (2022), Duong’s women are palpably real and contemporary. They are real in their playful attire, dressing for themselves alone, and they are real in how lamplight or the sun’s rays bounce between the furrows of their skin, revealing pocks and ridges. Duong’s likeness is thoroughgoing, the artist’s most consistent motif amidst changes in proportion, setting, and age. Such is the confessional nature of Duong’s oeuvre, which oscillates between portraiture, self-portraiture, and still lifes of resplendent plants, bejeweled pumps, and shriveled paint tubes, their contents exhausted.",Anh Duong: The Incoherences of a Gentlewoman,"43 E 78th Street, NY 10075","Mon-Fri 11am-6pm, Sat 11am-5pm", 9 Feb  - 31 May 2024

The hard, flat surface of masonite allowed him to play with space. Kirkeby states, “You put a line on a piece of paper or you take a brush or your thumb dipped in some ochre and rub it up on a cave wall and then you have a space. We’re in a space and we make a space. And by making it flat you can handle it.” Kirkeby considered the paintings on masonite to be more personal, and even more dynamic, than his paintings on canvas. Due to the long, storied history of paintings on canvas, Kirkeby felt the compositions needed to be more “crystallized”. In comparison, his paintings on masonite incorporated unconventional materials, such as collage and chalk, allowing Kirkeby to experiment with structure, form, and motif.Kirkeby started creating bronze sculptures in the early 1980s to pull himself out of a brief “artistic crisis”. His career was growing internationally, and Danish critiques of his art accused him of being too commercial. Like the paintings on masonite, the bronzes allowed him to play with space, but in a more tactile way. Kirkeby writes, “It is almost impossible to fixate a sculpture. It is best seen in passing, from the side. Individual details are difficult to get a hold of: they turn away from you. And even the nature of the material is so concrete, so much of this world, that it spurns dreams.” Kirkeby’s bronze sculptures became an important part of his oeuvre. They allowed him to incorporate figuration and the work of his sculptural heroes, like Michealangelo and Auguste Rodin. The sculptures defined him as an accomplished “painter-sculptor” in line with his German contemporaries, Markus Lüpertz and A.R. Penck.An internationally celebrated painter, sculptor, filmmaker, and author, works by Kirkeby are found in many museum collections worldwide including Tate, London; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; and Museum of Modern Art, New York, among many others. Important solo museum exhibitions include Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebæk; Museum Jorn, Silkeborg; the Beaux-Arts de Paris; The Phillips Collection, Washington, DC; BOZAR Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels; Tate Modern, London; IVAM Centre del Carme, Valencia; Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Whitechapel Gallery, London; and Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven.

While there is no record of direct correspondence between them, the Paris-based artists rubbed shoulders often enough to interpret reciprocity in their practices. They exhibited regularly with Pierre Matisse Gallery, where Dubuffet’s first solo exhibition occurred in 1947 and Giacometti’s in 1948. With singular bodies of work articulating the alienation and estrangement of a generation, the artists became icons of a postwar European vision at home and across the Atlantic.In New York, they both found acclaim and were among the roster of artists in the Museum of Modern Art’s New Images of Man (1959) curated by Peter Selz, who also organized solo exhibitions for each of them (Dubuffet in February 1962 and Giacometti in June 1965) at the museum. In the late 1950s, prior to Dubuffet’s commission to create his landmark Group of Four Trees (1969–72) for Chase Manhattan Plaza, Giacometti was initially chosen for the space. Unfamiliar with the city and unconvinced about how his figures would compete with the surrounding skyscrapers, he withdrew from the project. However, when he traveled to New York for his MoMA retrospective, shortly before his untimely death at the beginning of the following year, Giacometti made a special visit to the plaza and asked his wife Annette to stand where his sculptures would have been.Dubuffet x Giacometti is made possible by generous loans from American and European institutions, including Fondation Beyeler, Riehen; Fondation Maeght, Saint-Paul-de-Vence; and Pierre and Tana Matisse Foundation, New York, as well as from worldwide private collections.

Every moment has only one possibility.” Interested in the immediacy of the medium, she dedicated a large part of her artistic practice to producing drawings. Known for her “body awareness painting,” Lassnig’s works on paper are intimately connected to her singular approach, translating interior bodily sensations to line and value on the page. Concerning the connection between both forms, Lassnig states, “Every drawing is a prevented oil painting, because I do not repeat a drawing in an oil painting, [my drawings] are autonomous.”Lassnig’s drawings become experimental fields for spontaneously placed lines and color fields, as in Blaue Figur auf Rot (Blue Figure on Red), 1956. These compositions take shape across a range of processes, using acrylic, watercolor, and goauche aspects to tint her pencil works on paper.By bringing to the paper what she felt, not what she saw, Lassnig’s explorations of the subjective pith within are radically observed, producing images that represent immediate sensory impressions. Parallel to her introspective analysis through self-portraiture, Lassnig also observed the outside world–works on view include abstract depictions of a garden fence from the early 1960s in Wie am Gartenzaun (Like Beside the Garden Fence) as well as a kinetic scene between predator and prey from 1996 in Le buse (The Buzzard).Now rightfully recognized as one of the most important artists of the 20th century, Maria Lassnig made her own body the focus of her art early on, long before body consciousness became a central theme of the international avant-garde. Drawings reveals Lassnig’s unflinching, acutely internal process, bringing the viewer closer to their senses.About Maria LassnigMaria Lassnig was born in 1919 in Carinthia, Austria and passed away in 2014 in Vienna. Underappreciated for most of her life, Lassnig is now rightfully recognized as one of the most important Post-War painters.From a young age, Lassnig began to explore the human figure through drawing. She studied painting at the Vienna Fine Arts Academy but found the art scene at that time to be too limiting. She moved to Paris in 1960 and then to New York in 1968, continually exploring how to represent the body as it feels to inhabit rather than how it appears from the outside – a concept which Lassnig named Körperbewusstseinsmalerei (“body awareness painting”). On returning to her native Austria in 1980, she became the country’s first female professor of painting. She also taught animation during her time at the Vienna University of Applied Arts.Her life’s work won her many accolades including the Grand Austrian State Prize in 1988 and the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement in 2013 at the 55th Venice Biennale. She has been the subject of one person exhibitions at the Albertina Museum, Vienna; Deichtorhallen Hamburg; Kunsthaus Zurich; MoMA PS1, Long Island City, New York; Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Serpentine Gallery, London; Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam; and Vienna Secession among others. Lassnig represented Austria in the 1980 Venice Biennale alongside Valie Export, and she participated in Documenta in Kassel, Germany in 1982 and 1997.",Maria Lassnig: Drawings,"35 E 67th Street, NY 10065",Tue-Sat 10am-6pm, 15 May  - 22 Jun 2024

Having painted herself and her daughter Esme for much of her career, these are mostly self-portraits. Something has shifted in these new paintings—there is a rawness and urgency, a frenzy of paint in a new palette of yellow and blue.As Olivia Laing says in her catalogue essay, Giallo: “For two decades, Chantal Joffe has painted herself and her daughter Esme, a dyad of two faces, two bodies in tight domestic proximity. But now a rupture has occurred, the inevitable dislocation that takes place in homes across the world. The child leaves, the mother stays behind. You wouldn’t file a missing person’s report, but there’s an absence all the same.”In these paintings Joffe is seen in the bath, in the kitchen, in bed, sometimes crumpled asleep or deep in thought. Esme is still present, and Richard, her partner, appears asleep in bed, almost lost in a yellow duvet, one big arm exposed. The homage to Philip Guston is acknowledged by the title, Richard in Bed (for P.G.). The sequence of self-portraits also references Guston’s famous bed paintings, which Joffe was inspired by seeing at Tate Modern last winter.The title My dearest dust was suggested to Joffe by Esme, a reference to all the loss the family have experienced and to the dustiness of their home. The exhibition is accompanied by a publication with a text by Olivia Laing.",Chantal Joffe: My dearest dust,"20 East 79th St, NY 10075","Tue-Fri 9.30am-6pm, Sat 10am-5pm", 8 May  - 15 Jun 2024
